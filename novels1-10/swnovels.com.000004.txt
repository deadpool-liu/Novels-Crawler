Jamie is an illegitimate daughter of the Moore’s family. For the sake of her mother’s medical expenses, she has to disguise herself as a man for 18 years. During that time, Jamie has strugglled to live in the Moore’s house. And she puts up with all the humiliation and unfair treatment. However, on her sister’s engagement party, she is violated sexually by her brother-in-law, Dan. Later, Jamie gets pregnant after the night with Dan.	
Chapter 1 Just regard it as being bitten by a dog
	In a luxurious presidential suite, Jamie Moore is getting out of the bed with her sore body difficultly.
	From the clothes scattered on the floor, she picks up the compressing bra’s strip, and twines around her busty breast until it looks flat.
	She puts on her clothes quickly, then turns around to the man who is still sleeping in the bed.
	Her eyes are swelling due to continuous crying, filling with complicated feelings.
	Dan Williams, her future brother-in-law, is the most famous man in Leeds City. He took over the Williams’ enterprise when he was 18 years old. To people’s surprise, he has expanded the business all over the world within 10 years, covering various fields, from basic necessities of life, to aviation research.
	However, Jamie is such an inferior person, comparing to Dan. She is struggling for life, and merely survives by disgusting as a man.
	If it wasn't for her sister’s engagement party today, if she didn't give him a hand when he was drunk, perhaps, all these ridiculous things wouldn’t have happened, and she would have kept her virginity. Jamie thought.
	It’s too absurd to seek any justice for herself tonight, because she is disguising herself as a man.
	Jamie wipes out her tears. She can't imagine what will happen to her if this thing is discovered. She has to put up with the insult and humiliation silently. She is too afraid to stay, so she leaves while Dan is still sleeping.
	Jamie can only comfort herself by regarding the violation as a bite from a dog. It’s just that her first blossom was lost, which was kept for her future husband.
	There's no one around him when Dan is awake. Only the slight fragrance still lingers, which reminds him of last night.
	He remembers that he was drugged at the engagement party last night. Under the drug’s effect, he had sex with a woman out of his control.
	The woman was crying and shouting about letting her go. But he kept doing it tirelessly. And he violated her several times, because that was first time having sex.
	When he wakes up, the woman already left, leaving a blood stain in the sheet, like the blossom flower.
	Slightly squinting his eyes, Dan grows some interest in that woman who left silently.
	In Leeds city, countless women dream of sleeping with him. However, this woman left quietly after she lost her virginity to him. Interesting.
	Dan asks his assistant to bring some clean clothes for him, and says, “Go to check the camera’s footage. I want to know who dared to drug me.” His tone is deep, intimating that no one can disobey him.
Chapter 2 Disguise as a man
	It’s already morning when Jamie arrives at home.
	Her father, Jack Moore, who is in charge of the whole family, sits uptight on the sofa, with poker face.
	Jack stares at Jamie, and says disgustedly when he realizes Jamie was out all night, ”no wonder you are acting under-bred. After all, you're raised by that filthy woman.”
	Jack’s words hurt Jamie, like a knife stabbing into her heart. Her all–night abscence is just an action without manners in her father’s eyes. And her mother, who has dedicated her whole life to him, is just a filthy woman in his eyes.
	Such a father doesn't deserve her love and respect.
	However, now she stays at the Moore’s house in servility. Not for herself, but for her mother who is lying in the hospital. So Jamie has to lower her head, secretly clenching her hands, and says timidly, “Sorry father, it won't happen again.”
	“Now that you're part of our Moores, you have to drop your bad habits, and learn the rules of upper class. If you make one more mistake, you will be punished.”
	Jamie trembles a bit instinctively when she hears the words.
	Family rules of the Moore, is to be whipped for 100 times, by the one who is in charge of the family.
	These whippings are still fresh in Jamie’s memory.
	When she first came to the Moore family, she kept her mother’s advice in mind all the time. Thus, everything is done with great care.
	However, she still fell into a trap.
	She just accidentally touched Jacqueline’s watch, which was placed on the desk. But she got framed of stealing it. So Jack whipped her 100 times regardless of the truth. He beat her so hard that her back looked like a bloody pulp. She had been lying on bed for three months to get better.
	“Sorry father, it won't happen again.” Jamie repeats. Jack is impatient, but still tries to restrain, “Now your sister has engaged with William, you need to discipline yourself. Don't disgrace your sister and the family.”
	Jamie can't help to think of the night with Dan when she heard the wordWilliams, which made her blush.
	However, Jack gets angrier when he sees this. He can't believe that this coward and timid person is his son, whose head is lowering and clothes is clenched by hands.
	He would have driven him out if Jamie wasn’t the only son for succession.
	Finally, Jack let Jamie go back her room. Out of sight, out of mind.
	Jamie goes back to her room, and locks the door carefully. Then she grabs some clean clothes and walks into the bathroom.
	All her clothes are loose and saggy, in case someone will notice that she wears corset bar. Besides, her body is too slender to support those oversized clothes, which makes her have no masculinity at all.
	No wonder Jacqueline always calls her a sissy.
	Layers by layers, Jamie takes off the bra’s strip, which exposes her great body shape.
	Jamie feels sad when she looks at herself in the mirror. In fact, she's a cute girl with short haircut.
	Her mother was Jack’s mistress 18 years ago, which means that Jamie is an illegitimate child of the Moore family. In order to go back to the Moore family, her mother always tells her to live by disguising as a man. And all of their efforts pay off. Because the Moore family has no other child beside Jacqueline.
	To ensure the business of Moore family won’t fall in others’ hands, Jack has to get Jamie back, which is the last choice because she is a ‘male’.
	For the past 18 years, mother has contributed herself in raising Jamie. In returns, she gets nothing but illness and weak body. The high medical expense leaves Jamie no choice but to seek help from the Moore family. That’s why she came back to the family.
	Jamie still remembers how people looked like when she first came here. No one likes her, and she got no welcome but snobbery from the entire families. Even her father was also annoying her.
	Thinking of the past time, a bitter smile appears on Jamie’s face. Her fingers stroke her body, and there are marks left on her last night by Dan. When she feels her skin, where hickeys covers. The hickeys are so many that almost cover all over her body. It’s not difficult to tell from the hickeys that how hard she was violated last night.
	Jamie trembles when her warm fingertip touches the skin, and she can’t help thinking of last night, about Dan’s chiseled face. Suddenly, her face turns blush and hot.
	After all, she had never been closed to a man for the past 18 years, not even at school. She never speaks to a male classmate in private before, but now she has done the most intimated thing between male and female with Dan.
	She shakes her head to make herself stop thinking about this.
	That fabulous man is Jacqueline’s fiance, her brother-in-law.
	What she should hope now is that Dan will never find out it was her who slept with him last night.
	If her disguise gets exposed, not only she will be driven out from the family, but also her mother’s medical expenses will be cut off, which is really the end for her.
	At the same time, Dan has returned to the enterprise, the assistant already has the camera’s record for him. Dan asks, “What have you found?”
	“President Dan, the lobby’s camera was sabotaged purposely last night, so it didn’t shoot who put drug in your wine in the engagement party.” The assistant sweats while he speaks, “but the camera shows that on the way to your room, it was a man who carried you into the room.”
	Dan responses, “Do you know who he is?”
	The assistant passes a printed picture to him, and Dan takes a glance.
	Dan never meets the man on the picture before. When he looks into it, he finds that the man on the picture is more like an immature boy.
	Judging from the picture, that boy has a pretty face, a head shorter than him. And Dan can tell that the boy’s body is weak. Because he just slightly leaned on him, but the boy looked like he was almost crushed.
	Dan is sure that he never meets this person before.
	The assistant continues his report, “the camera was broken from here, so we can’t find out when the man leaved the room.”
	“Go find out.” Dan squeezes the photo, his tone sounds stately.
	This boy must have something to do with him being drugged, Dan thinks.
Chapter 3 Her “fiancee”
	“You missed that great chance last night!” Jacqueline’s mother, Catherine roares.
	“I drugged him last night, and I let someone sabotage the lobby’s camera. How would I know he didn’t show up in my room last night?” Jacqueline rebutes.
	“You’re so stupid! I've already told you to follow him, but you refused, wasting such great opportunity for nothing. Dan never gets close to female, he surely won’t have sex with you even you two are engaged. Then how can you get pregnant? Without a baby, how can you gain your place in William family?” Catherine sputters.
	The only reason why Jacqueline could engage with Dan, is because of the close friendship dating back to their grandfathers of both families.
	When both grandfathers were still alive 20 years ago, they settled down their grandchild’s wedding.
	At first, both of the family never took that seriously. Until the Moore’s is not as glory as before. To reach their submit period again, Jack insists to push through the wedding regardless of everything.
	They never expected that in the critical moment, something happened and ruined Jacqueline’s plan.
	“I heard what you said, just stops, Jamie is coming.” Jacqueline whispers to Catherine.
	It’s time for dinner, and Jamie is called by servant to come for dinner.
	Jamie, Jacqueline and Catherine are having dinner together.
	Jamie sits at the table, bearing all the complains from Catherine while she is eating.
	“You really think yourself as the young master of the house, don't you? Even need the servant to inform you to come for dinning. Don't you go to school anymore? Your teacher has called us to complain it.” says Catherine.
	Jamie skips school today, because she has no energy to go to school after what happened last night.
	“I don’t feel well today, that’s why I skipped school. I already asked for leave from the teacher.” Jamie explains.
	“I think you just want to be a freeloader at the house.” Jacqueline says arrogantly.
	This haughty side of her is totally different from the sweet and polite woman when Jacqueline is with Jack.
	Jamie still remembers her first day arrived to the house; Jacqueline kept calling her little brother kindly when Jack was at present, which made Jamie felt moved.
	But later she heard the talk between Jacqueline and Catherine, then she knows that all the kindness was just an act to drive her out of the family once they had chances. And that’s why Jamie was set up for the watch.
	Jamie chooses to remain silent though they keep picking on her. She just wants to finish her meal and leaves as soon as possible. But when she is ready to leave and go upstairs, something Catherine says stops her.
	“Look at you, how timid you are. What a shame! But it’s lucky for you, you can marry the daughter of the Summer’s family. When you two get married, remembers not to disgrace our Moore’s family.” Catherine says.
	Jamie is shocked after she heard. Then, she suddenly looks up to Catherine and asks, “Who is the daughter of the Summer’s family, and what marriage?”
	Jacqueline answers with a sneer, “The Summer is a notable family in Leeds. Others wish to marry her but failed. You, an illegitimate ‘son’, should be thankful to have this honor.”
	There’re always rumors about the daughter Chelsea of the Summer’s family. that she has a weak body and always gets sick.
	Several days before, a grand master told Chelsea’s grandmother that if Chelsea wants to get rid of all the sickness, she needs to marry a man with good character and matching birth date.
	And Chelsea’s grandmother believed that. She spread out her words to find a proper husband for her granddaughter.
	Thus, all the unmarried men in Leeds gave their to birth date to the Summer’s family, and Jacqueline and Catherine gave Jamie’s birth date to get rid of Jamie from the Moore’s family.
	Unexpectedly, Jamie actually got picked, which made Jacqueline and Catherine very happy.
	“Does dad know this?” Jamie asks.
	This is too ridiculous for a girl to be a matrilocal son-in-law for the Summer. Doesn’t Jack need her back to be the successor of the Moore family?
	Will Jack let her to be a matrilocal son-in-law?
	Hearing what Jamie's question, Catherine is unable to respond. She looks at Jacqueline subconsciously.
	After all, Jack knows nothing about this.
	Jacqueline answers disdainfully, “Dad will agree. After I marry Dan and give birth a son, you won’t be the successor in our family. Look at you, you are nothing but a sissy illegitimate child.”
	Jacqueline’s words are so mean that you wouldn’t believe she is a socialite from a notable family.
	Jamie always keeps silence. She can bear the insult from Jacqueline. But marriage will expose her disguise.
	Thus, for the first time, she rejects what Jacqueline said. “No, I won’t marry the daughter of the Summer.”
	Catherine and Jacqueline are so angry when they heard the rejection from Jamie, who has always been obedient.
	Catherine stands up suddenly, pointing to Jamie, and says furiously, “How dare you say no! I’m warning you that you have to be the a live-in son-in-law!”
	“No!” Jamie rejects again.
	Jacqueline sees that Jamie is determined, but she still thinks of something that will change Jamie’s mind. Jacqueline says sneering, “Fine, if you don’t agree with this, I will call the hospital now and tell them we won’t pay for you mother’s medical expense anymore.”
	Just like what Jacqueline has expected, Jamie says nothing about rejection again.
	For Jamie, her mother is the most important people to her. Nothing can compare with.
	Catherine and Jacqueline looks at each other gladly when they notice Jamie is not going to reject anymore.
	Jacqueline says contentedly, “As long as you do what we say, your mother’s medical expense will still be paid.”
	Jamie has no choice but to say yes.
Chapter 4 Fiance, come here!
	The Night is the most famous club in Leeds.
	The driver sends Jamie to the club after school. Jamie hears the news that her ‘fiancee’ calls to see her.
	Jamie comes reluctantly, but she has to think of her mother’s medical expense.
	She just hopes that everything goes smoothly.
	As soon as Jamie walks into the club, she gets tinnitus for the crazy loud music. Frowning and covering her ears, Jamie passes through the dancing crowd, and makes it to where Chelsea is.
	Chelsea wears heavy make-up, dressing hot, and holds a cigarette. It’s hard to connect this mature woman with the invalid in rumors.
	Jamie can’t help frowning; she really doesn’t like this place.
	Around Chelsea, sit some exaggerated dressing people. Those people must be Chelsea’s friends, Jamie thinks.
	Jamie approaches and says respectfully, “Hi, Mi..Miss Summer, I’m Jamie.”
	In front of others, Jamie will always pretend to be the timid bastard son.
	Chelsea takes a glance at Jamie, asks disdainfully, “you are Jamie who is going to be the live-in son-in-law of our Summers?”
	Jamie nods in a purposely obtuse way.
	“I hear that you are an illegitimate son of the Moore family?” Chelsea asks purposely.
	Jamie understands what’s going on now. The daughter of the Summer just wants to embarrass her by calling her out.
	Chelsea picks up the goblet and looks Jamie up and down. “you have a pretty face, but such a weak, slender body.” Chelsea says and walks around Jamie.
	The way Chelsea looks at Jamie, is like looking at a weirdo. Then, Chelsea stops and says, “How little sincerity your Moore’s family is, having such weak bastard to marry me.” She raises the glass and splashes the wine to Jamie’s face.
	Jamie’s mind goes blank by this sudden movement. The crowd all laugh about this.
	Standing still dully, the wine falls from her hairs drops by drops, into her shoes, also her heart.
	Jamie is angry, so angry that she wants to grab a glass of wine from the table, and splashes back to Chelsea’s face. What’s more, Jamie wants Chelsea to feel what it feels like to being humiliated. However, Jacqueline’s warning comes again in her mind, if she upsets Chelsea, her mother’s medical expense will be cut off.
	So, Jamie looses up her clenching hands, wipesg her face with the sleeves, humbly says, “You’re right, Miss Summer. I will work out more.”
	Chelsea grows deeper dislike towards Jamie after she sees how timid Jamie is when she got splashed, “A bastard is what a bastard is, you can’t hope any better from him.”
	“No need to be angry for this kind of loser, it’s no worth it to get uncomfortable for it. After all, not everyone can be as good as Dan.” A friend of Chelsea says by comforting.
	The moment Chelsea hears Dan’s name, her anger flees away.
	She looks back. That’s the VIP area, for one person only, that is Dan.
	The reason why she comes to the Night, apart from humiliating Jamie, is that she got news that Dan will be here tonight.
	At the same time, behind the potting, a pair of dazzling eyes fixes on Jamie.
	It’s a huge different between the man in the picture with the one got humiliated now. Stubborn but keeps tolerance. When he found out Jamie is the one in the picture, he feels things become a bit interesting.
	How desperate the Moore family is, trying to let Jacqueline have sex with him. He just agreed with the marriage, and then he got drugged immediately.
	Unlucky for them, Jacqueline failed that night. And the woman who slept with him that night, just vanished.
	It seems like he can only find out the true from Jamie.
	The information Chelsea got is true, Dan is here. But Chelsea gets furious when she finds out that Dan is looking at Jamie. Then she comes up with an idea. She says to Jamie, “Come here, my fiance.” Jamie walks toward her.
	Chelsea gives a sign to her friends, then all her male friends stand up and keep Jamie circled around.
	Jamie is confused, “Miss Summer, what is this all about?”
	“People always say great body shape always gets hidden by clothes. I wonder if I have misjudged you. How about you take off your clothes, let me see what you really get beneath the clothes.” Chelsea says in the tone like what she requests is quite normal.
Chapter 5 Who told you that you can leave?
	What?!
	Take off her clothes?
	Jamie hugs herself protectively when she heard that.
	“I don’t think it’s necessary, Miss Summer. I don’t have muscle, just slender figure.” Jan says complaisantly, and hopes that she can recall the decision.
	However, there is no way that Chelsea will let Jamie go easily. Under her sign, those man circling Jamie, are about to strip off her clothes.
	Jamie is shocked, and her face turns pale. Her disguise will expose if she gets stripped off.
	Mother is still in the hospital...
	For medical expenses, Jamie can’t let that happens.
	Thus, Jamie struggles hard and keeps protects the collar. However, her clothes still get teared up from the collar to the bottom, and her skin gets exposed.
	Jamie covers her skin by hands hurriedly... And she steps backwards without looking.
	Losing her balance, she has stepped on a pair of delicate Hand-made leather shoes. Then her feet sprain, she fails into a warm hug.
	The familiar body-smell dives into her nose. Jamie shocks and looks up.
	It’s Dan!
	Why he will be here?
	The moment Jamie sees Dan, the memory of the hot sexual night shows up in her mind, and her cheek turns red immediately.
	Lucky for Jamie, the light in the club is dark. No one can notice that her check is red blushed.
	Peoples are thrilled when they see Jamie failed into Dan’s body. And no one dares to strip Jamie’s clothes anymore.
	Everyone knows that Dan is a neat freak, he never allows anyone to get close to him.
	It’s said that a woman tried to get close to Dan before, but was stripped off all of her clothes publicly and tossed out on the road. And now Jamie touches Dan. It’s very obvious to people how Dan will deal about this.
	Thinking of that, people looks at Jamie in the way that takes pleasure in hers misfortune.
	All Dan can feels is that a soft body falls into his arms with sweet fragrance. Looking down, he can see the neck. Alongside exposed skin around the clavicle, then into the tore up collar....
	Dan stops breathing for a second, and his underbelly gets feelings about her.
	Damn it!
	What the heck!
	So many beautiful women throw themselves at him, and he couldn’t care less about this.
	But now, a man is in his arms, which actually raises up his hormone.
	Dan squints, thinking himself drunk.
	“How long do you want to keep relying on me?” Dan says coldly.
	His breathe reaches Jamie’s ears, which makes Jamie’s ears turned red.
	Jamie hurriedly stands up and bows to apologize to Dan.
	Dan keeps looking at her, like he wants to look through her.
	Jamie gets thrilled by Dan, and she lowers her head more.
	Is Dan recognizes her for the night? Jamie wonders.
	But Dan says nothing after he glanced at her coldly.
	Chelsea stands up and holds Dan’s arms, says, “Dan, Jamie is so bad. How dare him touch you. Don’t forgive him for that easily.”
	Dan just stares at Jacqueline, and takes out his arm which is held by Chelsea. And he says angrily, “Don’t get close to me.” Then he leaves.
	Chelsea stars at Jamie resentfully after she got rejected by Dan.
	Looking at Jamie in the confounded situation, Chelsea mocks and says, “How incompetent of the son of the Moore’s family. No wonder the Moore’s family toppled down.”
	How unpleasant this meeting is, which makes Jamie detested to Jacqueline.
	Jamie can’t help frightening with the though of marring this vicious woman, and what will happen to her and her mother once her disguise is exposed. Jamie just wants to leave as soon as possible.
	“Miss Summer, it’s late now. If there’s nothing else, I will go home now.” Jamie says to Chelsea and leaves.
	Chelsea shouts at Jamie, “Stop! Who told you that you can leave? Come back right away!”
	Jamie ignores her, and keeps walking to the doors.
	Those men who circled Jamie before, chase her up and are about to stop her. And Jamie gets scared by them.
	Just at the same moment, a group of bodyguards come and stop those men.
	Jamie doesn’t look back, so she doesn’t know what happened behind her. All her know is that she walks out from the club safely.
	After she walked out from the club, her confounded situation arouses people’s attention.
	She lowers her head to grad a taxi, covering her chest at the same time.
	A waiter comes out from the club, and stops Jamie. The waiter says, “Here, Mr. Moore.”
	It’s a Jacket, with the smell that Jamie familiars with.
	Jamie confuses, and asks, “What is this for?”
	The waiter answers, “President William asked me to give this to you.”
	The waiter turns around and goes back inside after he answered Jamie. Leaving Jamie alone, wondering.
	
Chapter 6 Throw a long line to catch a big fish
	After changing clothes, Dan stands in front of the french window, looking down at Jamie in the crowd.
	Looking at her thin figure, Dan can’t help thinking of his engagement with the Moore family.
	Though grandfather has settled down his marriage, he is not a dull that will be under anybody’s thumb.
	If it wasn't the Moore family that refused to transfer the land in the shallow bay that carries the childhood memories of him and his mother, he would never agree with this marriage.
	It's just a marriage. But he will never fall in love with any woman in his life So, it doesn’t matter whom he will marry.
	But somehow, without any reason, Dan can’t stop thinking about Jamie who was under the light, with smooth skin and dazzling eyes.
	How slender body Jamie has, as delicate as a piece of paper that can be crushed easily with a little force.
	Thinking of this, Dan can't help feeling a little thirsty. Especially her big eyes, which he seems to have seen somewhere.
	He always hates getting touched by others, but when Jamie touched him at that time, he didn’t feel antipathy at all.
	Even he thinks that Jamie has a good smell, a faint smell of familiar, and the face always makes him feel that he has seen it before, as if it's buried deep in his memory, but he just can't recall.
	The worst part was that when the boy was about to leave, a thought flashed through his mind that he wanted to pull him back...
	Is it because he has been abstinent for so long that he has no distinction between men and women? He feels like he's going crazy.
	“President William, I don’t understand. the surveillance shows that the person who drugged you is likely to be Jamie. Why didn't you teach him a lesson just now in the bar?” Assistant asks with confusion.
	What’s more, President William even let someone take his jacket to the guy, so as to avoid embarrassment for the boy.
	Hearing this, there is a flash of light in Dan’s eyes, “Sometimes, you need to throw a long line to catch big a fish. It’s not the time yet.”
	Dan can’t help thinking about Jamie again. When Jamie was bullied by Chelsea at the club, that pair of eyes, like an unyielding but weak little kitty, made him have the desire to protect her!
	Wearing Dan’s jacket, Jamie hurries home by taxi under the cover of darkness.
	Jamie doesn’t dare to walk inside the house through the front gate. She’s afraid that she will meet Jacqueline and Catherine. If they see what she looks like now, she will definitely get into troubles. So, Jamie chooses to slip in through the back door.
	Just when she is about to get off, there is ambiguous sounds around.
	By this time in the middle of the night, there should be no more people or cars nearby.
	She subconsciously looks in the direction of the sound. It's from a Humvee.
	It's too dark to see clearly the license plate and color of the car. Anyway, she's not interested.
	But the car gets in the middles on her way home, and she has no choice but to walk by it.
	She deliberately lowers her head, trying not to look inside the car. To her surprise, the car window is not closed.
	She catches a glimpse of three people in the car, two men and one woman. And the woman is sitting on one of the men, with a cheerful face.
	It’s Jacqueline!
	Jamie recognizes her because the light shines right on Jacqueline’s face.
	Jamie is shocked!
	Jacqueline is having sex with two men in the car!
Chapter 7 Jacqueline’s secret
	She is so bold!
	Jamie doesn’t think much, she wants to turn around and run away, but because she's too flustered, she accidentally kicks the railing by the roadside, and the noise catch the attention of the people in the car.
	Jacqueline sees Jamie immediately.
	Damn it!
	Jacqueline can’t continue what she is doing. She pushes the man away and gets dressed quickly, then gets off to chase Jamie with the two men.
	After all, Jamie is a girl, she can’t outrun the big men.
	Soon Jamie gets caught by back, and is forced to knee down.
	The sharp pain hits her immediately. Jacqueline has already stood in front of her when she is trying to stand up.
	Messy hair doesn’t cover the cockiness in Jacqueline, she tidies up her hair and says, “I just wonder who it is. Oh, it’s my dear bother.”
	Jamie lowers her head, no one can see clearly her expression. Only her timid voice can be heard, “What a coincidence, sister. I didn’t know that you're here. I'm preparing to go home. It's getting late. You should go back to have a rest earlier...”
	Jacqueline sneers after she hears what Jamie said. She reaches out and squeezes Jamie’s chin, “stop pretending. I know you have seen everything.”
	“No, I didn’t... I didn’t see anything.” Jamie gasps and pretends to know nothing.
	Jacqueline despises the way Jamie lowering head and stammering, which annoys her so much.
	Jacqueline grabs Jamie’s hair, forcing him to look up at her.
	“You little brat, I’m warning you, if you dare to tell anyone about tonight, your mistress mother will die!”
	For the sake of her mother, Jamie won’t be foolish enough to go against Jacqueline. Thus, silently bearing the physical pain and humiliation, Jamie swears, “No worry, sister. I didn’t see anything, and I won’t say a word about tonight.”
	Seeing Jamie cooperates well, Jacqueline withdraws her hand satisfactorily.. She won't give a damn about an illegitimate child like Jamie at all.
	“Let’s go.” Glancing at Jamie despicably, Jacqueline says to the men.
	Until Jacqueline left, Jamie gets up from the ground and limps back home slowly..
	After Jamie cleaned up herself, she lies in the bed with her eyes wide open. She can’t fall asleep at the thought of what happened today.
	The despicable look of Jacqueline and the humiliation of Chelsea, are just like a huge stone placed on her chest, making her hard to breathe. She really wants to leave, staying away from the Moore family, and the so-called upper class.
	However...
	Jamie is still a high school student, how can she afford the medical expenses if she leaves? Thinking of that, Jamie gives up the thought of leaving. After all, her dignity is nothing, comparing to her mother’s life.
	Just before falling asleep, she imagines that maybe one day, when mother recovers, she can say goodbye to all of these.
	At the weekend, Jamie doesn’t need to go to school, so she goes to the hospital to visit her mother.
	Her mother, Adele, who is lying in the bed, is happy to see her daughter.
	Jamie sits aside, and peels an apple for her mom.
	Adele is suffering from serious renal failure. People with the same disease may recover by paying for a new kidney, but she is different. Now she has only one kidney. She can only depend on the imported machine and medicine.
	“How is everything? Do your sister and her mother give you a hard time?” Adele asks out of concern. She notices that Jamie is thinner than before.
	Jamie feels sad at her mon's questions, but she doesn’t want her mom to worry. So, she looks up to her mother with a smile, “Don't worry, mom. Though they don’t care much about me, they don’t give me hard time.”
	Adele relieves, “Remember to study hard, and help the Moores gain glories.” After all, the identification of Jamie is still a dirty spot for her. Jamie nods, “I know.”
	Adele watches Jamie peeling the apple, Jamie has grown up so fast without her notice. Jamie just likes Adele, both have a pretty face.
	If it isn’t for that reason, Jamie would have dressed beautifully in a long skirt and long hair. She would be a pretty 18-years old girl. But to keep both of them safe, it has to be this way.
	“How is your father?” Adele asks out eventually.
	Jamie is stunned, almost cut herself.
	Speaking of Jack, Jamie can’t help thinking about his arrogance, and how he called her mother as filthy woman.
	“He’s fine.” Jamie replies perfunctorily.
	Adele can tell that Jamie doesn't like Jack.
	After Adele fleeted from that place, she became a club singer. And she got injured accidentally when a customer picked up fight with another one, resulting in the removal of a kidney.
	Later, for the sake of Jamie, Adele had to become a mistress of Jack’s. But when she got pregnant, Jack abandoned her immediately.
	But in the end, she miscarried. She didn’t tell anyone. Instead, she let Jamie to replace Jack’s child. It happens that Jamie is thin and weak, the Moores doesn’t suspect at all.
	Adele sighs, “Jamie, no matter what, Jack is your father. You need to try your best to accept him.” Since Jamie was a kid, Adele has been telling her that she is Jack’s child, in case someone will question.
	"Please wait outside. The patient is going to have dialysis chemotherapy." Just as Jamie wants to refute, the nurse comes in.
	Jamie feels it's time to go back. After a few words with mom, she goes back home.
	But the moment Jamie steps inside the Moore house, she can sense that something is different.
Chapter 8 A prey
	Catherine is busy cooking in the kitchen, where she has never stepped a foot inside. And the servant who always disrespects her, calls her young master respectfully.With the words, young master, all the people sitting on the sofa in the living room look at her.
	When Jamie has eye contact with a pair of dazzling eyes, she lowers her head in hurry.
	No wonder the whole family are acting weird, it’s because Dan's here.
	When Jamie is thinking how she can sneak back to her room, Jack calls her. She has no choice but to go to Jack in front of everyone's eyes.
	At this time, Jack looks less stern than before. He introduces, “Dan, this is my son, Jamie.” Then he says to Jamie, "Jamie, Dan is your sister’s fiance, you should call him brother-in-law.”
	“Brother...Brother-in-law.” Jamie's tongue begins to tremble, and the whole person begins to shake.
	These small details are caught by Dan.
	Dan recalls that Jamie wasn’t so frightened like now even when she was humiliated at the club. Seems that she really does have something to do with the woman that night.
	Dan confirms his thought in mind, he says with smile, “Am I a monster? Why are you so scared of me? Is it because you did something wrong to me?”
	As soon as he says this, Jamie is flustered that her face turns red.
	Of course she is afraid of him, for what happened that night. And what scared her most, is being recognized!
	“I...I didn’t.” Jamie stutters again.
	Jack gets angry seeing Jamie's appearance. However, Jacqueline is happy, for having a chance to talk to Dan finally.
	This is her best chance to fawn on Dan.
	Jacqueline says in affectation voice, “Mr William, my brother is too young to have much experience. Please don’t blame him, that will frighten him.” Saying this, Jacqueline tries to sit closer to Dan. But before she can move, she gets stopped by a look from Dan.
	Then she has to sit away from Dan, because she doesn’t want to upset him.
	“Is it? He looks really young, is he fifteen?” Dan reclines on the sofa lazily, looking Jamie up and down.
	Jamie still carries baby-fat on her face, with the figure she has dressed herself, makes her look much younger than she really is.
	Under Dan’s watching, Jamie is afraid. The way Dan is looking at her, just like looking at the prey.
	Jamie wants to leave, but Jacqueline doesn’t want to let her go easily.
	Jacqueline answers Dan, “Jamie is already 18 years old, but looks younger than he really is. We don’t know where he inherited from.” “Though Jamie is slender, don’t be fooled by his appearance. I heard that he had a fight with others at the club few days ago. What a surprise! Right, Dan?”
	Jacqueline says purposely what happened that day when Chelsea met Jamie, but she doesn’t tell the truth at all.
	The second Jack heard that Jamie went to a club and had a fight with someone, he gets angry.
	Jamie takes a look at Jack, and all she can see is the angry face of Jack.
	Jamie feels sorry for herself, she’s afraid that she will get another 100 lashes!.
	Dan grows more interest in Jamie, when he sees Jamie doesn’t talk back or explain for herself.
	“Em...” Dan hums. His long finger keeps tapping on the sofa. No one knows what he is thinking.
	However, Jacqueline gets excited by Dan’s action. And she keeps saying, “You are good at this, brother.”
	Jamie knows thing is not going to be good to her.
	The man sits on the sofa, has a facial expression that is not easy to detect. Dan keeps staring at Jamie, says slowly, “Did he? It seems like that I was there also at day.”
Chapter 9 Train ‘him’ to become a real man.
	Dan’s words make everyone surprised. Especially Jacqueline, her talkative mouth freezes suddenly, she turns around and watches Dan.
	Dan keeps saying with a bit sarcastic look, “The young master I saw that day was humiliated byseveral girls, and couldn’t fight back. He just lowered his head like he is now.”
	Then, Dan turns to Jack, “If Uncle William cherishes Jamie too much to cultivate him, you can send him to my place, I can help you to train him to become a real man.”
	Jamie’s face turns pale. If she gets sent to Dan’s place, it’s just like sending her into the tiger’s den.
	“Thank you for your kindness, President William. My son is always sick, of course he can’t reach up to you.” Jack says. Then Jack takes a look at Jamie, he is so angry that he wants to beat Jamie.
	Jacqueline sees how angrier Jack becomes, and she feels satisfied about this. And she says to Dan flattering, “That’s very true. President Dan, you are the most unique person in the world. Jamie can’t compare to you.”
	Seeing what happens in here, Dan smiles, and has a basic knowledge of the Moore’s family now.
	It seems like that Jamie is nothing more than a puppet of the Moore’s family.
	But Dan feels cherish for Jamie, when he looks at her, and finds her trembled.
	“Oh, young master, you should return my jacket.” Dan says.
	“What?” Jamie doesn’t respond to what Dan said.
	Jamie was thinking about how she would get scorned. Thus, it takes her a while to realize that Dan was talking about the jacket, which the server gave to her after she leaf the club.
	After she came back last night, she has hung the jacket in her room.
	Seeing Jamie has no action, Dan says again, “if you want to keep it yourself, I don’t mind.”
	Jamie finally understands that Dan is helping her out of that award situation. She feels moved, but doesn’t understand why Dan would do that.
	Jamie doesn’t dare to keep thinking about this, she lowers her head and says, “I’ll go and fetch it for you.” Then, she turns around and goes upstairs.
	Jack is a bit confused after he has seen what happened just now.
	He is surprised that this useless son of him can be treated differently by Dan. Everyone knows how serious mysophobia Dan has. And he never let anyone touches his things. But Dan gave Jamie his jacket, and offers his help to Jamie.
	Jack thinks that he can have benefit from Jamie later.
	It seems that Jamie is as useless as he thinks.
	Jack smiles and says, “Mr William, my son is obstrusive. If he somehow offenses you, please don’t get serious with him.”
	“You’re too welcome, Uncle Moore.” Dan doesn’t say a lot, but he takes a glance at Jacqueline.
	Jacqueline trembles a bit under Dan’s glance.
	She could never think that Dan will help Jamie.
	
Chapter 10 You are the one who came in my room
	Jamie fetches the Jacket from her room, and comes downstairs, passing it to Dan.
	Dan doesn’t take the jacket, just looking at Jamie. Then, Dan says, “Uncle Moore, I have something that needs to be dealt with. I’m going to leave.”
	Jack answers in hurry, “It’s late now, how about you stay here and have dinner before leaving?”
	Dan rejects politely, and insists leaving.
	Jack can only give a sign to Jacqueline, says, “Then I let Jacqueline to walk you out.”
	Jacqueline would never miss the opportunity to be alone with Dan, so she comes forward quickly
	Dan doesn’t even look at Jacqueline, but points to Jamie and says, “it’s fine. I think it’s better to let young master to walk me out.”
	“Me?” Jamie points at herself, looking around. She can’t figure out what’s wrong with Dan.
	Eventually, bearing the angry looks from Jacqueline, Jamie walks Dan out.
	Dan’s fancy and limited amount car is parked in front of the house. The assistant steps out from the car to open the doors for Dan. Just when Dan is about to leave, Jamie realizes that she still holds his jacket.
	So Jamie goes forward in hurry and says, “Mr. William, your jacket...”
	However, Jamie doesn’t know that Dan will stop and turn around suddenly, which makes Jamie bump into Dan’s hug.
	Jamie rubs her nose to ease the pain, just when she is going to apologize. Dan reaches out his hand and grabs Jamie’s waist, putting her against the doors.
	Dan is supporting against the door with one hand, and circles Jamie in his hug with another hand.
	Under this close distance, Jamie’s heart is bouncing fast when she has a closer look at Dan.
	Dan’s skin is healthy and without flaws. And his dazzling eye can lure someone into them, just like magic.
	Jamie thinks of that night when the two of them were in bed. Though she doesn’t remember the details, her face still turns blushed when she thinks of it.
	Just when Jamie is thinking about the night, Dan asks, “Why are you blushed?”
	Jamie is surprised, and her face turns red.
	“That’s none of your business” Jamie talks back.
	Jamie realizes that she shouldn’t talk to Dan like this. So she turns her head, avoiding eyes’ contact with Dan.
	However, Dan smiles and speaks near Jamie’s ear, lowering his voice, “I have mysophobia, you just throw away the jacket.”
	Jamie can’t help popping her eyes. If so, why did you ask me for that jacket? Jamie complains in mind.
	But Dan doesn’t plan to let her go, says, “You are the one who came in my room that night.”
	Jamie shocks, what had Dan found out?
	Jamie avoids Dan’s eyes, stuttering says, “What room... what night...I don’t know what you mean at all.”
	“You don’t know at all? Should I show the camera’s footage now?” Dan says.
	Dan looks at Jamie coldly, which makes Jamie flustered. After all, she didn’t cover her face that night, the camera must have shot everything down.
	So, has Dan found out who she really is? Is he going to exposed her? Jamie keeps wondering.
	If she get exposed, all the thing she has achieved now will be.....
	Hanks shaking, Jamie reaches out both hands to grasp Dan’s sleeves. She’s biting her lip so hard, and is going to beg for forgiveness.
	With the thought of her mother, Jamie stops herself from crying.
	Seeing how delicate and touching Jamie is, Dan fails to be cold to Jamie.
	“Mr William, Sorry...” Jamie tries to apologize to Dan, but she only manages to say half of her words.
	“As long as you tell me who was that women that night, I won’t give you a hard time.” Dan says in moderate.
	“What?!” Jamie feels blank at the moment.
	Jamie looks at Dan in startled. He doesn’t recognize her?!
	
Chapter 11 Leave and go far away
	Dan doesn’t know what’s wrong with him. The begging from Jamie, makes him soft, and he can’t bear to give a hard time to Jamie.
	Dan feels a bit annoyed, and loosens his hand, which is grasping Jamie’s waist. Loosing his tie, Dan says, “I will give you three days, to hand that woman to me.”
	Then, Dan turns around and gets inside the car.
	Jamie holds the jacket dully, and watches the car leaving.
	But Jamie doesn’t notice that Jacqueline is watching all of it quietly behind.
	At first, Jacqueline didn’t care about Jamie at all, cos he is only a bastard son. So, even Jamie came across her sex with others, she didn’t take it seriously. But what happened today made Jacqueline pay attention to Jamie.
	Jacqueline could never think that Jamie has a close relationship with Dan. Even though Jamie promised to her that he won’t tell anyone about that, but that doesn’t mean that Jamie will not tell Dan.
	If Dan knows about her affairs, their engagement will not exist anymore. And her father will beat her to death. She can’t let thing happen like this... Jacqueline thinks.
	Back to the Moore’s house, Jacqueline asks her mother Catherine to come to her room, and locks the doors for talking. Then, she tells everything to Catherine, about what happened that night at the back doors.
	Catherine is so furious after she heard that.
	Catherine says angrily, “I warn you already, to be careful when you hang out. Good for you, now you hung out in front of the house, and you got spotted by Jamie. If your father finds out about this, you can imagine what will happen to you!”
	Jacqueline answers in regrets, “Mother, I know I was making mistake. But what should I do now? Jamie is in close relationship with Dan, if Jamie tells Dan what happens...”
	Catherine knows that now it’s not the time to blame, she interrupts Jacqueline, and points to Jamie’s room, “We need to strike first to gain the advantage.”
	“You mean...” Jacqueline understands what her mother wants to do.
	Catherine and Jacqueline plot together, both of them look vicious.
	Jamie returns to her room, holding Dan’s jacket dully. Sitting on bed, she keeps thinking what Dan spoke to her. How can she find a woman within three days?
	Thinking of this, Jamie is so worried that she almost cries.
	How about just leaving, and going far away with mother?
	But even they leave, she still needs money for medical treatments.
	Where can she get money...
	Right, how about borrowing some money from that guy?He might lend the money to me... Jamie thinks.
	Carrying this thought, Jamie falls asleep deeply, with the jacket holding in arms.
	
Chapter 12 The biggest stain
	Inside the hospital room.
	Adele is nervous, when she sees two peoples barging into her room.
	“Why are you here?’ Adele asks.
	Catherine and Jacqueline walk inside the room, and glance through Adele with sneer. Catherine says, “It seems that Jack still has feelings for you bitch, he even let you stay in nice VIP room.”
	“Mother, after all. She is already a half dead person. Our Moore family are all kind. Dad let her stay in her, which is for the sake for her timid and useless son. Dan has already done everything he can, we don’t need to dispute for this.” Catherine says.
	Catherine and Jacqueline keep saying horribly, like there is no one else in the room.
	The more Adele has heard, the pallor her face turns.
	Adele wants to talk back to them when she hears they are defaming Jamie. But with the thought that Jamie just went back to the Moore’s house, and Jamie hasn’t gotten herself a solid support. All her words disappear.
	Catherine and Jacqueline become more complacent, when they see Adele doesn’t dare to fight back.
	Catherine says mockingly, “Do you know what life Jamie has lived on the Moore’s house? You really believe that he lives in the life of young master of the Moore’s family? Jamie is nothing but a bastard, returning to the Moore’s family doesn’t destroy this disrepute truth. Not only in the Moore’s house, but all the upper classes have despised him for this.”
	“You...” Adele covers up her heart with shaking hands, and her face is so pallor that looks like she is going to faint.
	“Me? What’s the matter with me? I only tell you the truth, that’s all.” Catherine says. “If you know that the consequence is hard for you to bear, then you shouldn’t have done it at the first beginning. What kind of people give birth the same kind of son. No wonder Jamie is so useless.”
	“That’s enough! Stop!” Adele yells. She can put up with all the humiliation from them, but can’t bear to let them humiliate Jamie in front of her.
	But Catherine doesn’t going to let her go easily, she keeps saying,” People like you, is the biggest stain of Jamie’s life. Every day you live, is just a reminder to Jamie that he is a bastard son. Though he comes to the Moore’s house, he could never get rid of his origin.”
	“Ah!” Adele shouts. Regardless of her weak body, she gets off bed with bare feet, and grasps Jacqueline’s hair, slapping her.
	Jacqueline covers her swollen check, looking at Catherine astonishingly, “Mom, she hits me..”
	“You bitch! How dare you hit my daughter!” Catherine can’t stay cool at all after Jacqueline was slapped. She comes forward, and slaps Adele.
	Adele is weak; a slap from Catherine makes her failed on the bed.
	Catherine and Jacqueline are not planned to stop, they keep beating Adele.
	The noise inside the room alerts the nurses. The nurses run into the room and stop both Catherine and Jacqueline. “Stop! What on earth do you think you are doing!”
	Catherine and Jacqueline are pulled away. Jacqueline tides her hair, coldly looking at Adele, “If I were you, I will kill myself, the sooner the better! In case I become a burden to my son.” Then, Jacqueline leaves proudly with her mother.
	Adele’s against the bed with a pale face. No matter how the nurses persuade her to go back to bed, she refuses.
	What Jacqueline said to her lingers in her mind, like a knife keeps stabbing her chest.
	Thinking of what situation Jamie is under, she can’t stop questioning herself. Is she really made a mistake?
	Is her existence really a burden to Jamie?
	Jacqueline looks back to the room when she walked out. She asks Catherine doubly, “Mom, is that really going to work?”
	Catherine answers confidently, “Relax and watch the coming show.”
Chapter 13 There’s someone jump off the building
	There was only one day left for the three-day deadline that Dan offers to Jamie.
	Jamie is going to ask that person to borrow some money, and leaves with mother together. Then Dan can’t find her anymore.
	However, she can’t reach out that person on phone. Just when she worries about what to do next, she gets call from the hospital
	“Young master, have you come to the hospital today? Is your mother left the hospital with you?” The nurse asks.
	“What happens? I thought my mother should be in the hospital.” Jamie answers. She goes to school for all day, no time for hospital yet.
	“The nurse was having a ward round this morning, and you mother wasn’t at the room. We noticed that she hasn’t come back for the rest of the day. We have searched through the whole hospital, but still can’t find her. So we want to ask whether...”
	“What are you saying? My mother is missing?” Jamie interrupts the nurse.
	She drops down the phone, can’t hear what the nurse is saying. Running out of the classroom, and grabs a taxi to the hospital.
	Jamie is so worried all the way to the hospital.
	How can mother go missing? Where can she be if she is not at the hospital?
	Jamie doesn’t understand how can a patient with serious kidney failure go missing out of blue.
	Because cars can’t be parked in front of the hospital, so the driver stops at the road across the hospital.
	Jamie pays in hurry, then she goes across the road without thinking.
	Though it’s red light for cars, a truck keeps running, and rushing toward Jamie.
	With a sharp noise, the truck goes by Jamie so close in an inch. Jamie falls in the side road, and on her waist, a pair of warm arms keeps her protected.
	Jamie is still in shock, she dully turns around to see who’s behind her.
	All Jamie can see is that Dan uses himself as a cushion to protect her, and it looks like that Dan is a bit angry with what was happening.
	“Did you lose your mind? You didn’t avoid car when it came straight toward you.” Dan says.
	Jamie looks at Dan dully, then she realizes that it was Dan who saves her life.
	“Thank you for helping me out.” Jamie stands up in hurry, and her legs are injured by truck, bleeding. Her blue school uniform is in red by the blood.
	Jamie doesn’t care for the pain, she just wants to get to the hospital
	Dan finds that spot of red so uncomfortable, he goes up and grasps Jamie’s arm, says,” Don’t you know that you’re bleeding?”
	“It doesn’t matter, just a bit of blood. Jamie answers with a pale face, taking her arm out of Dan’s hand.
	Jamie doesn’t have time for Dan, when her mother is missing.
	“Sorry, Mr. William. I have emergency that have to go. I will thank you properly next time.” Jamie says, and keeps going forward to the hospital
	Dan watches Jamie’s slender figure, so slender that as if Jamie will fall down in any minute.
	Dan frowns; his hand still has the feeling and texture of Jamie’s arm.
	This man is much more slender than Dan thought.
	Jamie doesn’t like a man at all. Dan thinks.
	Jamie limps to the inpatient department. The nurse who looks after her mother just comes downstairs. Seeing how bad Jamie looks like, the nurse asks surprisingly, “What happened to you, young master?”
	Jamie doesn’t answers but asks, “Any news of my mother?”
	“Not yet, we have already searched the whole hospital...” A scream stops the nurse.
	“Look! Someone is trying to jump off the building!” the one who was screaming says.
	Jamie is shocked, and looks up to the top of the building.
	Under the hot sun, a woman in hospital uniform is standing on the rooftop of the 20-floors high building, with a foot stepping outside the banister.
	Just one look at this, making Jamie felt like her heart is going to stop. The woman who is standing on the rooftop is her mother.
	Jamie eyes turn reddish, she shouts, “Mom!”
Chapter 14 Get pregnant
	Before Jamie can do anything about this, her mother has falled into the ground hardly.
	Jamie just stands there, watching her mother’s dead body lies in just few steps away. Polices comes, all the noise, all the sirens, but Jamie can’t hear any of it...
	Her world has become a pure darkness. All Jamie can see is how her mother jumped off the rooftop, taking all her hopes away.
	Jamie faints, lying on the ground unconsciously.
	Dan is on his way to visit his grandmother who stays in the hospital. He doesn’t expect that someone will jump off the building in hospital.
	When Dan walks near, he happens to see Jamie fainting on the ground. He goes forwards, and seizes Jamie round the middles.
	From the talking around the crowd, Dan realizes that the woman who suicide is Jamie’s mother.
	It’s not easy for Jamie to witness his mother dies in front of him. Dan thinks.
	The pale face of Jamie, makes Dan seizes Jamie tighter. However, Dan just seizes Jamie with a bit more force, and he can feel how weak and slender Jamie is, it seems that he is going to crush Jamie’s bone,
	Dan feels afraid, and walks into the hospital quickly, yelling, “Where are the doctors?”
	The hospital is in a mess right now for what just happened, but sees it is Dan who asking for doctors. The nurses and doctors don’t dare to treat Dan with disregard, and they spare the VIP room for Dan.
	“Come and check what happens to him.” Dan stands in front of the hospital bed, and he keeps watching at Jamie.
	Even Dan himself doesn’t realize that his care to Jamie has already exceeded the boundary.
	Right on the same time, the assistant walks into the room and reports to Dan, “President Dan, we have some progress in the Leeds Marriott.”
	Dan frowns and raises his hand to let the assistant talks outside. He doesn’t want anyone to interrupt Jamie’s treatment.
	Hearing out all the reports for the assistant, Dan looks back to the wards. The doctors who just finished Jamie’s treatment walk out from the room. Dan says to the doctors, “I have some emergencies need to be dealt with now. Jamie is in your hands now. When I come back, if anything bad happens to him, I will make the hospital shut down.”
	Maybe it’s because of Dan’s strong aura, the doctors wipes his sweat and says, “No worry, President William.”
	Dan nods his head, doesn’t say anything else, and leave the hospital.
	Jamie is having a long dream.
	In her dream, she dreams that she and mother go back to the rented house where they lived when Jamie was a child. Though life is hard, they are free and happy. No need to disguise, no humiliation, and no need to pretend...
	However, the moment Jamie awakes all the memory before she fainted flushes back.
	Mother’s dying body lying in front of her, and her blood dyes Jamie’s eyes in red.
	Jamie realizes that dream is just dream, nothing in dream can exist.
	The nurse opens the door and comes inside, seeing how absent-minded Jamie is, she sighs and says,” Miss, the dead has passed away, please take care of yourself.”
	Jamie turns around slowly after she heard what the nurse said, asking,” What did you just call me?”
	“Mi…Miss?” The nurse answers.
	However, Jamie bursts into laughter as if she has heard some funny jokes.
	Jamie thinks of all the things she did for mother, because mother wants it, so she insists to finish, no matter how ridiculous things are. But now, mother was gone, and all the hard work becomes useless, no meaning at all.
	Laughing, then Jamie starts to cry, she can’t stop wiping.
	The nurse comes forward and comforts Jamie, “Miss, please calm down. You are pregnant now. For the sake of baby, you can’t have any stimulation.”
	Pre…pregnant?
	Jamie stops crying and raises her head suddenly, she grasps the nurse’s hands, “What did you just said?”
	
Chapter 15 How can a man get pregnant
	“You...you have been pregnant for a month.” The nurse is obvious shocked by Jamie. She takes off Jamie’s hands, which are grasping her hands carefully, asks, “You don’t know that?” Jamie shakes her head dully.
	Jamie thinks of that her period hasn’t come this month, but she doesn’t take that seriously, because her period hasn’t on time all the time.
	But now, the nurse tells her that she is pregnant. How can she get pregnant this time, she’s just 18 years old, she’s still a student. Jamie thinks.
	“You looks young to me, this baby, you are going to keep it or not. You’d better talk with your family and your boyfriend.” the nurse says.
	Family? Boyfriend?
	What family does she have?
	The only family has dead in front of her. And her father Jack, always believes that she is a male. If Jack finds out that Jamie has lied to him by disguised all the time, and now with pregnancy, she will be beaten to dead by Jack.
	As for boyfriend...
	Jamie thinks of what happened that night, and she is sure that Dan is the baby’s father. That night was under no protection. Lacking of experience, Jamie didn’t take any pill after that night.
	Who knows that just one night, and Jamie gets the ‘jackpot’.
	Touching her belly softly, Jamie feels complicated when she thinks about there’s a baby inside her, a baby belongs to her and Dan.
	Jamie gets into dilemma, whether she should keep the baby or not.
	When Jamie keeps herself in her thought, two casual visitors are outside the wards.
	“How lucky Jamie was. Such a big truck ran into him, but he couldn't even be killed.” Jacqueline says.
	“Some nosy person saved him.” Catherine answers.
	“It was his luck that allowed him to escape the accident.” Jacqueline says in hatred.
	Catherine and Jacqueline keep talking while they walk towards to Jamie’s room. When they are about to reach the door, the conversation inside the room makes them stopped.
	“Miss, the first month in pregnancy is the most unsteady month for the baby. Please control your emotion, don’t act like what happened before.” the nurse reminds.
	Pregnant? Who is pregnant?
	Jacqueline looks at Catherine with shock. Isn’t this the Jamie’s room?
	Just when they are in doubt, Jamie’s voice comes out from the room, “Okay, thank you.”
	It’s Jamie.
	Jacqueline is so shocked that she widens her mouth. From the door’s crack, she can see that only Jamie and the nurse are inside the room.
	And the nurse just told Jamie that he is pregnant!
	But how can a man get pregnant!
Chapter 16 Jamie is a woman!
	Unless....
	“Jamie is a woman!” Catherine and Jacqueline says simultaneously, then they cover up their mouths quickly. Jacqueline takes out her cellphone in hurry, recording the whole conversation inside the room. Until the nurse is about to leave the room, Catherine and Jacqueline leave quietly.
	They walk to the staircase corner, Catherine grapes Jacqueline’s shoulder in both hands, says with uncontrollable ecstasy,” Did you hear that, Jacqueline? Jamie gets pregnant, Jamie is a woman!”
	All these years, Catherine has held grudges for Adele gave birth the only son for the Moore’s family. Now, she finds out that Jamie is not a man at all! And Jamie has been disguising as a man to treat the Moores. If Jack finds out about this, there’s no way that Jack will let Jamie stays at the house anymore.
	Nevertheless, Adele is dead. All the family property will belongs to Catherine and Jacqueline, if Jamie is driven out of the family.
	Catherine and Jacqueline has plotted something together, and go back to the house.
	Jack was in the company when he received call from the hospital, about Adele jumped off the building to suicide.
	Jack never cares about much for Adele,but still, she gave birth a son to him. So, Jack goes back home, and let someone to take care of Adele’s funeral.
	The moment Catherine gets inside the house, she happens to hear that Jack is handling about Adele’s funeral. Catherine gives a sign to Jacqueline. Then Jacqueline says, “ Father, I know you are a nice man who attaches importance to family affection. But someone like Adele, doesn’t deserve your kindness.”
	Jack always knows the dislike of Catherine and Jacqueline toward Adele. But now she is dead, it’s no need for her to care about those little things anymore.
	“ You are just a kid that you don’t know about such thing. If you have time, you should get in touch with Dan, which is what you really should do.” Jack answers.
	Jacqueline doesn’t talk back, but takes out her phone, and plays that sound record she recorded in the hospital. “Father, you should listen to this record before you do anything for Adele.”
	Jack listens to the conversation between Jamie and the nurse, when the word--pregnant comes our from the speaker, the atmosphere in the house drops to iced cold.
	Jack stands still dully, he feels like something wrong with his hears, but it’s Jamie’s voice.
	What the hell is going on?
	Jamie gets pregnant? Stop joking!
	Jamie is the only son of the Moore’s family, how can he get pregnant!
	“ Father, Jamie has been lying to you the whole time! She disguises herself as a man, which is heard by me and mother in person at the hospital. This is no misunderstanding about this.” Jacqueline explains.
	Catherine says something that makes things become worse,” Husband, can’t you tell from that? This is a plot set by Adele, to treat our family property.”
	Jack’s body shakes, he almost faints to the ground.
	Though Jack can’t bear how timid and useless Jamie is, Jamie is still the only successor of the Moore’s family. No matter how useless he is, the future of the Moore’s family still needs him to succeed. Now, Jacqueline tells Jack that Jamie is actually a woman?! How can Jack recept it!
	Jack is so angry, and he punches his fist to the wall, yells,” Go to find Jamie back, I need to find it out by myself!”
	Before Jamie can change the hospital gown, the servants of Jack have brought her back. So, Jamie doesn’t have time to wear her bra’s strip.
	Though Jamie keeps wearing the bra’s strip for all these year, her breath grows well. Anyone will know she is a woman by her graceful body shape. Watching Jamie likes this, Jack almost blacks out.
	Jack points to Jamie, scorns,” Good for you! Keep lying to me all these years, with your filth mother!”
	“ Don’t swear my mother like this!”Jamie shouts. She just lost her mother, under a very difficult time. Her inner disgrace is provoked when Jack’s people took her back to the house rudely. At this moment, Jamie doesn’t care about her disguising. Mother is dead, and Jamie doesn’t need to disguise anymore.
	“How dare you to talk back!’ Jack is furious. “ you and your filth mother, set a plot to get the family property. Now you don’t fell ashamed when all your plot gets exposed?’
	“Shame? What is shame? The only reason I would have done this, it’s because of you!” Jamie argues with anger when she hears Jack is humiliating her mother.
	Lots of things have happened at the same time, which almost crushes Jamie’s spirit down. The death of Jamie’s mother, becomes the creak for Jamie’s breaking down.
	Jamie yells at Jack angrily,” If you have love for my mother, how would she ask me to disguise as a man to gain your love? For all these years, she remembers your promise to her, but you? You only takes her as a play dull!”
	“ Even when she is so sick, you didn’t visit her, not even once!” Jamie is leading off all the hares for the pass 18 years. She hates Jack,and everyone else of the Moore’s family. “ If you have shared her pity, me and my mother won’t have come to where we are today...”
	Jamie can’t stop trembling and crying.
	However, Jack doesn’t regard himself wrong, but becomes more angrier. “ How dare you to blame me for this? Do you treat me as a father or not? Knees down!” Jack shouts at Jamie.
	“Why should I knee down? Have you ever fulfill your job as a father?You can’t even tell your child as a man or woman, shame on you!” Jamie responses with a sneer.
	Jack is so angry that his hands keep shaking, he yells,” what an ungrateful child! Someone brings me my whip, I need to whip this ungrateful child until she dies.”
	Jacqueline has already prepared Jack’s whip, and she hands it to Jack.
	Jamie can’t stop trembling a bit when she sees the whip.
	She wants to run, but the servants who circle her around makes her failed.
	Jack uses all his strength to beat Jamie, he beats her so hard that makes Jamie kept rolling over the floor. The hospital uniform becomes strips by stripe, and Jamie skin is whipped and bleeds.
	All the new whips on Jamie, and the loudness of whipping, all show to people that how cruel the master of the Moore’s family is.
	Jamie keeps covering her face, huddling herself up, bearing the whips silently.
	Though she is in great pain, but the physical pain is far less than the mental one.
	Every whip is like a scissor, bit by bit, cutting off all her relationship with the Moore’s family.
	At this moment, Jamie finally realize how little she means to the Moores, they don’t have any feeling for her.
	
Chapter 17 Five years later
	The only reason why Jack brought her home, was only because she was a ‘son’. The second time is when Jack finds out she actually a girl, he wants to beat her until she is dead.
	Such a heartless person is not worth to be her father, Jamie thinks.
	Jamie keeps clenching her teeth to bear the pain, she doesn’t ask for help or forgive for once.
	No one knows how long has this whipping continued, until a heavy rain pours out side, only the punishment stops.
	And Jamie gets throw out from the house under this heavy rain.
	Rain drops on Jamie’s injuries, and runs to the ground mixing with blood.
	Jamie can’t hold much longer before she faints, for she already has a weak body.
	Not far from Jamie, a car slowly drives close to Jamie. The owner of the car comes out quickly with an umbrella, hugs Jamie into his arms, and brings Jamie into the car.
	...
	Inside the President office of the William’s company.
	The assistant hands over Jamie’s health report to Dan weirdly,” President William, this is the health report of Miss...Mr Moore.”
	Dan puts aside the document he is reading, and gets the report.
	He notices that the assistant is acting weirdly, asks,” Is there anything wrong with this report?”
	The assistant touches his nose and answers, “ It says that ...Mr Moore.... is pregnant.”
	Dan was going to looking through the report, but gets shock after what he has heard,” what?”
	The assistant doesn’t know how to explain to Dan, after all, this is ridiculous.
	When the doctor told him that Jamie is actually a girl. He was too surprised to say a word, no mention that later he found that Jamie is pregnant.
	Dan doesn’t wait the assistant to finish his words, he goes through the report quickly. And he drowns himself into thinks, squeezing hardly on the report.
	“What the hell is going on!” Dan shouts. He throws the report to the desk hardly, can’t think clearly right now.
	The report shows the gender of Jamie is female, and with one month pregnancy.
	And it’s exactly one month from that night.
	Now everything comes clear to Dan.
	Why the camera only recorded down Jamie is the only one carried him into the room?
	Why Jamie is so slender, so timid in personality, doesn’t look like a man at all?
	Why Dan will have feeling towards Jamie?
	All the truths are lying in front of Dan. Jamie is the woman he has kept searching for.
	And this woman has not only lied to him, but also carries his own blood! Dan thinks.
	Dan stands up and leaves the office in hurry.
	The assistant follows and says,”President William, where are you going? You still have a meeting later!’
	“Cancel all my schedule today.” Dan says.
	Dan went to the hospital first, and was told that Jamie has brought back by the Moores. Then, Dan goes to the Moore’s house in hurry.
	Due to the heavy rain, Dan’s car is driven slow.
	Under the rain, a sliver-whiter car has passed along Dan’s Maybach. And Dan also passes along with Jamie.
	No one knows that this passing has last for 5 years.
	Sunny day
	Five years later, Pennine House in Leeds.
	“ Ian baby, you really don’t need Mommy to help carrying?” A clear voice sounds in the empty hallway, a pair figure of a mother and son stops in front of the door, then they open and doors and walk in.
	“No need! This is what a man should do, no need for your help, Mommy.” Ian patiently explains to Jamie again, which he has said thousands times before.
	Though the voice is sweet, Ian gives a cool impression to others. A handsome pretty boy is carrying bags, big ones and small ones, but his face is tight like an adult. Those big eyes are shinning, together with his pouching little mouth, which earns lots of affection.
	“Haha, you are just a little boy, do you know what the word ‘man’ means?” Jamie can’t stop laughing when she hears what Ian said. Her eyes are in crescent moon shape because of laughing, bright and dazzling.
	Ian closes the door,then puts down the luggage, says,” A man is like Ian, raise up Mommy well, can be cute and handsome, also can protect Mommy and do all the house works.”
	Jamie is moved by what Ian said, she rushes to hug Ian, rubbing Ian’s checks, says” It’s good to have a son, a mother with a son is like having a treasure.”
	“ Mommy, is a son with a mother is like having a treasure.” Ian corrects Jamie’s mistake, and classifies the clothes into orders.
	“ You are right, then you make dinner tonight.” Jamie feels no shame to ask Ian to do house chores, and she kisses Ian on his check.
	Ian hasn't adjusted to the time difference, he finally realizes today is Saturday after thinking for a while, “Mommy, aren’t we agree that I do the house chores on Monday,Wednesday and Friday, then your turns are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and random on Sunday?”
	“ Do you know how much hard work and hardship I have been through just to raise you up? Back to the year...” Jamie clenches her clothes with her sad face, trying to talk about the old time.
	“ Okay, okay. I know, and I go to cook now.” Ian can’t bear his mother. Every time if she doesn’t want to do something, she will act like this, having a big talk about the old time. Ian is so familiar with this.
	Jamie happily takes the luggage carrier into the room to sort out after she hears what Ian said.
	This house is really lovely, neat and clean, All the furniture is bought by her friend--Wendy. Any lacking, Jamie can always get it nearby.
	But all these things aren’t come in for free. Wendy keeps telling Jamie how poor she is before Jamie comes back. Until Jamie promises Wendy for multiple times that she will give back the money to her, this stint Wendy finally stopped her drama.
	Jamie puts the clothes into the closet piece by piece. When she goes finding for the wash supplies, she realizes that all the wash suppliers were thrown because Ian wants the new one. The house looks more of a home after everything is in position.
	Jamie goes to Ian’s room to help sorting out after she finished hers. Ian doesn’t have much luggage, besides clothes, is the note book that Jamie bought him. Speaking of Ian’s computer skill, Jamie feels ashamed of her inferiority. But Jamie doesn’t understand what Ian is doing with the computer every day, so Jamie let Ian do what he wants after a while.
	When Jamie is sorting out Ian’s clothes, she finds a superman underwear that she bought for Ian long ago, she can’t stop herself from laughing.
	“ Mommy, it’s not right to spy on others’ privacy.” wearing a SpongeBob apron, Ian walks into his room with his mouth pouching. The apron was especially made by Jamie for Ian, the size is fixed to Ian.
	
Chapter 18 Interview for C&R designer
	Ian feels so non-sensed when he sees his mother giggles over his superman underwear.
	“It’s natural and legal that I watch the privacy of my own son, who can say anything about this.” Jamie put away the underwear. Smiling treacherously, Jamie keeps thinking that she has to find a way to let Ian to put this on after he showers tonight.
	Ian trembles a bit for knowing that his mother is up to no good.
	Just when Ian is thinking, the doorbell rings.
	“ Go to see who is at the outside before you open the door, and don’t open for strangers, okay?” Ian has already come to the door, standing on the shoes-case and looking through the peephole when Jamie is saying.
	It’s a woman who stands outside, shoulder-long hair makes her looked neat, health skin with her height, she turns the stiff and black suit into fashion style. Ian remembers that she is Mommy best friend, Wendy.
	Ian opens the door.
	Wendy though is was Jamie who opened the door, so she wanted to hug Jamie, but gets empty. Then she looks down, seeing Ian wear that cute apron, with his hands still on the lock. Those big eyes splashes, watching her still.
	“ Ah! Ian. Long time no see, you are still cute.” Wendy hugs Ian, and rubs against Ian check with her face.
	Wendy is the first friend Jamie has met after Jamie went out the country, first one and also the best one. Maybe because they both come from Leeds, Wendy has taken a lot care of Jamie when they were in Spain.
	Five years ago, after got thrown into the rain with heavy injuries, Jamie would have died if Chris didn’t save her.
	Chris is Jamie friend from childhood, the young master of the Lockwood’s family. Because Jamie has saved Chris when he was drown, thus, they becomes good friend. And Chris is the only one,beside Jamie’s mother, who knows Jamie real gender before Jamie’s 18 years old.
	When Jamie was threatened by Dan, Chris was the only one Jamie can think of to borrow money.
	That day Chris just went back to Leeds, and he heard that Jamie had come back to the Moore’s family, so he wanted to visit her.
	Who knows that Chris happened to find Jamie with injuries in the heavy rain. After rescuing Jamie, Chris brought Jamie out of the country with Jamie’s agreement.
	Thus, Jamie gave birth the baby, which is why now she has such lovely little Ian stays with her. So glad that Jamie feels so lucky that she didn’t do the abortion.
	Jamie hugs Ian over from Wendy’s arms, touching his head, says,” baby Ian, go to cook. Mommy has some catching up to do your aunt Wendy.”
	Ian nods and goes back to the kitchen.
	Hearing what Jamie said, Wendy can’t help to complains,” Jamie, how can you let such a little child to cook, you are basically extorting child.”
	“ My own son is willing to cook for me, if you envy, you can give birth a child if you can.” Jamie says in gloating.
	Wendy looks at Jamie’s figure, says depressing, “Fine! You are the one with child, I can’t catch up that now.”
	Ian has cooked fours cuisines and one soup, all in family style, but all of them smells nice and delicious.
	Serving the dishes on the table, Ian just wants to tell Jamie and Wendy that dinner is ready. Before he can say anything, they have rush to the table and sit down. Ian has nothing to say about this, but puts out a chair and sits next to Jamie.
	“Wow, Jamie. Can you lend me Ian for couples days? It’s been a long time for me to not have a nice and proper dinner.”Wendy says in desperately. So desperate that she wants to take Ian home with her.
	“ Eating can’t stop your mouth talking! I warn you, Ian is my everything, so even think about taking him away from me. If you want, you can give birth a baby then.” Jamie makes joy on Wendy, for she knows clearly that Wendy won’t get married before 25 years old.
	The next day
	Standing in front of the C&R building. Jamie looks at this building, the C&R letters are so obvious. Looking from the bottom, makes Jamie a bit dizzy.
	Jamie holds the address the Wendy gave her, the note gets a bit wrinkle for Jamie squeezes it in nerves.
	After taking a deep breathe, Jamie clams herself down, looking confidently.
	She was the top designer in F&S company when she was in Spain. Interviewing a regular position for designer should be a piece of cake for her. Jamie thinks. With the thought of this, Jamie walks inside to the building.
	Jamie walks to the front desk, says politely,” Hello, I’m Jamie. And I made an appointment yesterday for interviewing.”
	“ The director has told us about this, please follow me, Miss Moore.” The lady in the front desk smiles, leading way for Jamie.
	The lady knocks the door of the director’s office. After she gets the response, then she says to Jamie,” Director is inside, please.”
	Jamie unconsciously bites her lower lip, pushing the doors slowly. The office is cold, making Jamie chilled. It’s still spring now, too early for air conditioner. Maybe it’s some kind of the test, Jamie thinks.
	“ Hi, I was the person who...” Jamie says in nice and polite manner. But before she can finish her self-introduction, the chair against her suddenly turns around, interrupting her talk.
	“ Miss Jamie, right?’ says the director sitting on the chair. Wearing a pair of glasses, supporting his chin by hands stand on the desk straightly, which made him seem gently. “ I have read your resume, you used to be a designer for F&S company?” He asks.
	Jamie nods with her browns slightly frowning, answers,” Yes, I have been a designer for F&S for two years.”
	“I want to know why you will chose our company, instead of the F&S.” The voice of the director doesn’t match his gentle appearance, but cold and alienated.
	“The reason is simply. F&S is in Spain, now I’m back to Leeds, naturally, I will need a job in Leeds. And C&R is famous in the fashion industry, so I come. It doesn’t like I choose to come here by quitting on F&S purposely.” Jamie answers with truth. This director is much more easier to be dealt with, comparing the peoples in F&S, Jamie thinks.
	The director is a bit surprised. Usually, the interviewees will say a lots of praise toward C&S, long lasting for least 5 minuets. And she finished already?
	“ Have you brought your works today?” The director asks casually, which is totally unnecessary. How can someone comes for interviewing the designer without her works.
Chapter 19 Will I let go of you to let you run away again
	“Of course.” Jamie answers. Then she takes out the drafts which she draws at her spare time.
	The director picks up the draft and glances, Jamie’s skill and ability are full shown from the draft. The director is surprised.
	Every draft is indeed a piece of good work, with the unique idea’s of the designer. Bold style and colors, fierce but also soft, is really rare and high-level in the industry.
	Based on these works, the director has already decided to hire Jamie. But before that, he needs to report to the President. Cos before Jamie arrived, the President has already told them that he needs to interview the designer by himself this time. No one knows why the President does it this time, because he has never done this before.
	The director calls to the President office with inner line, then he asks for his assistant, says,” Emily, show Miss Jamie to the President office.”
	“ Ok, director.” Emily nods and walks to Jamie.
	“ Follow me.” Emily says to Jamie. Then she leads to the elevator, pressing down the number, flirting her hair. A strong smell of Channel fragrance comes out.
	Getting inside the elevator, Emily takes out her mirror to fresh up. Through the mirror, she sees Jamie who seems to wear no make up at all. Emily sneers, nowadays, no one will leave the door without make up, this girl is a skillful one for make up. Emily thinks.
	Knock, Knock.
	Emily knocks the closed door, flirting says,” President, the interviewer has arrived.”
	There is a strict rule on C&R, beside President and his office, no one can get inside the President office without permission, no even those who comes to visit the president. For those visitors, they can only wait in the break room until the President asks for them. Thus, all the women in C&S eager for the president’s favor, getting inside to that ‘holly’ door.
	“Let her in.” a rumble voice comes out behind the door.
	What?! Emily can’t believe that the President will let this woman go inside directly, inside the room.
	Jamie doesn’t know the rule of C&R. She taps Emily’s shoulder, asks,” Can I go inside now?” Which means Emily is standing on her way.
	Emily steps aside unwillingly, looking at Jamie with jealousy. She has been working at C&R for almost three years, and she can’t get through that door. How come a silly interview can get inside.
	Jamie takes a deep breathe, and breaths out slowly. Then she opens the door and walks in.
	“ Long time no see, Jamie.” Behind the desk, a swivel chair is facing toward a huge french casement, then a familiar face is shown after the chair is turned around.
	Jamie looks at the face in front of her and her legs are paralyzed.. It’s him, Dan William.
	Jamie turns around and tries to run away, but gets pulled on her wrist. Stepping backward unsteadily, she falls into a pair of arms, a hug with slightly mint smell.
	“Still want to run away? You made it 5 year ago. Now you show yourself to me, don’t even think to run away again.” Dan says near to Jamie ears, Jamie can feel his breath on her skin, which made her blushed.
	She doesn’t show herself to Dan. Right, it’s Wendy! Jamie realizes it.
	No wonder Wendy keeps saying a lot nice words for C&R. Wendy told Jamie last night that she has helped Jamie to send out her resume to the C&R, which made Jamie wonder how this lazy person becomes so enthusiastic at that time.
	It turns out that Emily has sold her out.
	“Let go of me first.” Jamie bits her lower lip, and her palms also sweat because of nervous,
	“Let you go? To let you run away again?” Dan smiles. Jamie understands him so well, that she knows what his laugh means. Dan is angry.
	Jamie keeps struggling, but gets held harder by Dan. His arms are like iron, making Jamie felt uncomfortable.
	“Dan William, let go of me first. I promise that I won’t run away this time. Where can I escape when I’m on your domain.” Jamie doesn’t realize that Dan is still bossy, even after 5 years.
	Noticing the discomfort of Jamie, Dan let go of her. He keeps watching at Jamie.
	Jamie left in hurry five years ago. So she won’t know that Dan has checked out all her background.
	So when Jamie comes here in female dress, she gets found out by Dan immediately.
	Dan is more mature than five year ago, but also feels more strange too.
	But everyone must have changed within five years.
	Jamie smiles bitterly, which makes Dan nervous and scares about it. Dan let loose his hands against the door, and turns back to his desk, sitting down.
	Jamie doesn’t know what to do next, her face turns a bit reddish.
	Dan smiles seeing Jamie acting like this, says,” Don’t you come here for interviewing? Come here.”
	Jamie walks to Dan dully. Standing in front of the desk, Jamie feels like she can’t breathe anymore.
	Jamie is afraid of height.
	“Where have you been for five years?” Dan asks when he is typing, looking casually.
	Jamie looks up with surprised, this question seems has nothing to do with her interviewing.
	“Spain.” Jamie answers.
	Dan stops typing and looks up, watching Jamie. The sunlight shines from behind, as if Dan is glowing.
	“What were you doing in Spain.” Dan looks a bit tired, which Jamie has never seen him like this before. But it just lasts for a second, then Dan becomes cool again.
	“Just working.” Jamie lies. When she was giving birth to Ian in Spain, she couldn’t go out to work. She couldn’t be where she is now, if it wasn’t the help from Chris in Spain.
	Dan knows that Jamie doesn’t tell him the truth, but he doesn’t angry about this. Looking at Jamie, who hasn’t aged a bit for the pass five years, Dan has a misconception that they have never be apart.
	“Why didn’t you tell me when you left five years ago, and when did you come back?” Dan asks coldly.
	“I didn’t have time when I came back the day before yesterday.” Jamie answers with her head down. She is afraid of having eye contact.
	“You have learned how to lie during these five years.” Dan stands up suddenly and walks in front to Jamie, squeezing her chin to make her looked at him. Biting her low lip, Jamie is about to cry, which makes Dan felt pity.
	Dan softens his indifference, touching Jamie’s lips. Thinking about the old time.
	
Chapter 20 Dine with me
	“The last question, why did you come back?” Dan keeps asking.
	“I have eaten enough Spain food.” Jamie answers in complain.
	Dan laughs. Though he knows that she just talked nonsense, it still makes his mood become better. His voice still sounds cold, “ Come to work tomorrow.”
	Does that means she is hired? Does she get the job through relationship? Jamie thinks. Despite all these, Jamie is happy. At least, working in C&R is very well-paid.
	“Okay, then I will leave first.” Jamie says to Dan.
	Leave? Dan can’t help thinking of the night when he was going to the Moore’s family for her, but only got the news that Jamie had been driven out. Then he has searched the entire Leeds for her, and how powerless he feels every time when he got no clues about Jamie.
	“Wait. You haven’t come back to Leeds for a long time. I will get you familiar with the surrounding first.” Dan pulls Jamie out of the office, and heads to the underground parking.
	“Get in.” Dan opens the door of Jamie’s side and says to her.
	Jamie gets into the car skillfully.
	Dan gets inside the car and puts his seat belt on. Seeing Jamie sits still, Dan moves closer to Jamie.
	Jamie stops breathing for a second, her heart beating fast. When she doesn’t know how to react, Dan has helped her put the seat belt on, and drives like nothing has happened.
	I’m such a fool! Jamie thinks, and feels so embarrassed. She just thought that Dan was trying to kiss her.
	Dan sees Jamie’s face is blushed, he asks, “You feel hot?”
	“Ah? No.” Jamie turns her head aside, in case Dan finds out her embarrassment.
	“Are you just shy?” Dan says in a good mood.
	“Why would I get shy? You are the one who gets shy.” Jamie talks back.
	Dan smiles and drives into the highway, “ Don’t constrain yourself, just be how you were like in the old times.”
	“Old times?” Jamie confuses. When did she ever get familiar with Dan?
	Dan’s face turns gloomily. After Jamie left, Dan has dug up all her background and information. To his surprised, Jamie is the girl who used to live next to him, no wonder he finds her familiar. But clearly, Jamie has already forgotten about him.
	“Where are we going?” Jamie asks. The atmosphere gets better for that. Watching the view that goes backwards, Jamie can’t recognize where are they. How big change has happened during these five years.
	“Food street.” Dan has driven off the highway when he answers Jamie. The speed becomes steady after a turn.
	Food street? “ How do you know that...” I’m hungry.
	Before Jamie can finish her words, her stomach helps finish that.
	Jamie lower her head in embarrassment. What a shame! She should have ate more than just a piece of bread this morning.
	How disgraceful she is!
	“Haha.” Dan smiles and then laughs.
	“ We’re here.” Dan says and gets out from the car, Jamie follows.
	The aroma form the dessert shop makes Jamie become hungrier.
	When the desserts are served to the table. Jamie can’t wait digging in.
	Dan looks at Jamie, noticing that she only focus on eating. Dan gets a bit angry for being ignored.
	Jamie feels something wrong at the moment. She looks up and sees Dan’s cold face. Frowning, Jamie thinks, what is he upset about? He wants to eat too?
	Looking at these delicate desserts, Jamie is hesitating whether she should share them with Dan or not. Finally, she passes the dessert that has already bitten by her to Dan, “ Do you want some?”
	Dan is at ease, looking how unwilling Jamie is, makes him feel it funny. Still, he has a bite of the desert.
	The dessert is in small portion, not much left after Dan’s bite. Jamie eats the rest in hurry, and moves on to the next one.
	Jamie is so insensitive that she misses the meaningful smile of Dan.
	Finishes all the desserts, Jamie leans on the seat satisfying.
	Watching the empty plates, Jamie asks embarrassedly, “I ate them all accidentally, do you need to order more? “
	That is not accidentally, Jamie just can’t stop when she is with foods.
	“No need. Come to dine with me.” Dan stands up and walks out.
	“Okay.” Jamie follows.
	It’s good to have long leg. It seems that Dan is walking casually, but Jamie has to jog a bit to catch up with Dan. So, Jamie stops catching up to Dan, she is not going to make it anyway. Thus, Jamie walks in her normal speed.
	When Jamie slows down, Dan slows down also. There is only three steps distance between them.
	He’s doing this purposely. Jamie thinks.
	After dinner, Jamie watches her fully stocked stomach gloomily. She wasn’t going to eat anything after the dinner, but she still ate the fruit and desserts that served after.
	Pennines House.
	Ian keeps watching by the window, he is curious when he sees the black Bugatti Veyron of Dan.
	The sky has darken already, the orange street light shines upon Dan’s face through the car’s window. Though Dan says nothing, his aggressive momentum can still be felt.
	The atmosphere inside the car is a bit embarrassing.
	“Em.. I will go then.” Jamie doesn’t like embarrassment, so she talks to break the ice.
	“You don’t invite me to visit your house?” Dan says with a smile.
	Visit?! Jamie gets nervous. Because Ian is at the house, if Dan comes visit, her secret will be exposed. Jamie thinks.
	“No!” Jamie says loudly and nervously.
	Dan looks at Jamie with his lips compressed, unsatisfied and unpleasant.
	Then Jamie realizes what is going on. When did Dan ever get rejected like this, he must be angry now.
	Jamie looks down to her thighs, feeling nervous and insecure.
	No one knows how long has it been. Dan says coldly,” get off.” Jamie opens the doors and gets off. The second she closed the door, the car rushes out.
	Jamie looks at the direction that the car disappeared, thinking, haven’t seen him for few years. He becomes harder to understand, turning against people so quick.
	Hearing the door is opened, Ian comes down from the chair that next to the window, and walks to Jamie,” Welcome home, Mommy.”
	“Come on, Ian baby.” Jamie says to Ian and kisses him on the cheek. The moment Jamie sees Ian, all her worries go away. “ How was your day? Are you getting used to the new school?” Jamie asks.
	“No bad. How about you, Mommy? Who gave you a lift today?” Ian asks with his eyes squinting.
	Ian knows that Jamie rarely hitchhikes. What’s more, today is her first day for work, she won’t hitchhikes some strangers to home.There mush be something he doesn’t know, Ian thinks.
Chapter 21 Are youl a futiful son
	Jamie answers in vague,” just a worker. Have you ate yet?”
	Ian knows that Jamie is trying to change the subject, but he doesn’t expose her, “ Already. I will starve to death if I wait for you home to cook.” Ian says.
	“ That’s right. If I come home late, then you just cook and eat first, no need to wait for me, okay?” Jamie feels glad for how Independent Ian is.
	“ I know. After all, I can’t count on you.” Ian nods.
	Jamie feels embarrassed, she grabs the clothes and heads to the bathroom. Then she thinks of something and goes into Ian’s room, heading out with Ian’s clothes and his superman underwear.
	“Mommy, what are you trying to do with my superman underwear?” Ian notices that Jamie has found out his hidden underwear, having a bad feeling for what Jamie is going to do.
	“Wash and clean, of course.” Jamie picks Ian up, heads to the bathroom together.
	Ian keeps struggling like it’s the end of the world. But just in vain.
	In the early morning next day
	Jamie is awake by the noise outside. She checks the time, it’s still early but she can’t fall into sleep anymore. So she freshens up and leaves the room.
	“Morning, Ian.” Jamie rubs her eyes while she is yawning.
	Ian is busy cooking in the kitchen, it seems like he is the ‘mother’
	“Morning to you too, Mommy. Today is your first day to work, you need to eat more.” Ian pours a glass of milk and hands it to Jamie.
	It seems like that Ian forgets today is Tuesday, so it should be Jamie to do the house chore. In words, Ian gets used to this already.
	Jamie feels satisfied and warm with Ian’s breakfast. Get lose, Dan. All she needs is her baby son. Jamie thinks.
	“Your cooking skill becomes better. Remember to wash the dishes later.” Jamie says.
	Ian almost gets choked by the milk, he says to Jamie,” Mommy, how can you do this to me!”
	“Haha, this is what a son for.” Jamie says shamelessly.
	“How about the ‘dutiful son’ you said you are going to be?” Ian asks.
	Jamie used to say that she will be a ‘dutiful son’, be dutiful to her son. But judging from what happens now, Ian is the dutiful son indeed.
	“I have already forgoten that.” Jamie touches her stomach, she has finished a good breakfast.
	Jamie drops off Ian to the kindergarten, then goes to work in hurry. Though it’s still early for work, she doesn’t want to come across with Dan. After all, they had a dispute yesterday.
	“Jamie?” The director walks to Jamie.
	“Morning, Director.” Jamie greets with a smile.
	Then Jamie sees the name tag of the director, Shawn Hall.
	Shawn wears a sliver-grey color suit today, with tidy hair and a pair of golden edge glasses. Nice and gentle manner, it seems like Shawn is easy to get along with. However, Jamie doesn’t have good impression on Shawn.
	“Morning, Jamie.” Shawn answers, and walks into the elevator with Jamie.
	There are only Jamie and Shawn inside the elevator. Jamie doesn’t worry whether Shawn will act bad on her. After all, camera monitor is inside. Otherwise, Jamie really wants to go to another elevator.
	None of them talks during the elevator going up.
	“I heard Emily said that you got into the President office yesterday.” Shawn says casually.
	Jamie feels weird for what Shawn said, taking a glance at Shawn,then she nods and answers, “Yes.”
	“I have been here for four years. This is the first time that someone else gets inside to the President office beside the assistant.” Shawn says. Behind those glasses, he has bizarre thinking toward Jamie getting into the office.
	Actually, there are two peoples who get inside to the office beside Jamie. The two that are known to the whole company, Bruce Hill and Duke Field, friends of the President.
	But Jamie is much inferior, comparing with them. Why she can get inside to the office. Shawn doesn’t understand.
	“Is it?” Jamie says. Though Jamie doesn’t understand what Shawn means, she doesn’t like the taunting tone he is saying, indicating that Jamie is not qualified enough to get inside. But Jamie keeps smiling, doesn’t let her thought show on her face.
	“At C&R, the necessary element to survive is absolutely obeying with orders of the president. If you provoke the president, the entire company will suffer. “ Shawn says, and the elevator arrives to the destiny. Shawn walks out first and says,” Wish you luck.”
	Jamie feels absurd. This person is clearly dislike her, but he still wishes her luck. Jamie can’t tell this is a curse or real wish.
	Walks into the designers’ office, Jamie finds an empty seat and sits down.
	A tiny figure girl walks in at 7:50. She is in dull for few second when she sees Jamie.
	“Hi, you must be new one to the company. I’m Nana.” The girl says.
	“Hi, I’m Jamie Moore.” Jamie introduces herself smiling.
	“So crowded in the elevator. You’re so early today, Nana. Oh, who is this beautiful?” a tall man walks in, taping his shoulder to get rid of the dust. When he sees Jamie, he is in dull for few second like Nana.
	“She is Jamie, Jamie Moore.” Nana says.
	Jamie smiles, nice and polite.
	“Oh, Beauty Jamie, right. I’m Adam Lee.” Scratching his head, Adam is shy when Jamie is watching him.
	“ Who is the another designer?” Jamie asks for there is one empty desk.
	Adam and Nana looks at each in horror, “ It’s Emily. She is also the assistant of the director. It’s said that she is a daughter of some kind of company, and she only comes to C&R for getting close to the president. She is very cocky. You just ignore her.” Nana shares her experience with Jamie. Clearly she has badly treated by Emily before.
	Jamie nods, looking around the office,” Are we the only designers of C&R?”
	“Of course not! Have you looked into C&R before?” Adam doesn’t know what to say when he sees Jamie shaking her head. “C&R has almost a thousand staffs, but in different floors. We don’t have much chance to go to other floor. We have a dozen designers, all in master level. Me and Nana has prepared for long time before we passed the interview. Honestly, How exactly did you get in?”
Chapter 22 Treat her as she treated me 1
	Adam and Nana look at Jamie with curiosity. Jamie feels lacking of confidence at the moment. Though she is well qualified, she still feels like she gets in through relationship.
	“I sent my resume to the company, then gets in after the interview of the director and the president.” Jamie looks at them innocently. After all, she can’t tell them what Dan asked her in the office.
	Adam and Nana is going to ask further when Emily walks in. Emily wears Chanel one -piece dress, Gucci bag and high heels.Walking to her desk arrogantly, she sneers when she sees Jamie, then she sits down.
	Jamie and Nana looks at each other speechless, shrugging their shoulders.
	The whole morning, Jamie has been thinking about design.
	Time for lunch, Emily leaves the office firstly. Nana finally relaxes, “ the devil has gone finally! Jamie, let’s have lunch.”
	“Sure, where?” Jamie turns off her computer and asks.
	“Staff Canteen, of course.” Nana holds Jamie’s arm and walks outside.
	“Nana, will we come across the president in the Canteen?” Jamie asks purposely.
	“The president never eats in the Staff Canteen. He always eats at the Royal Hotel across the street.” Nana answers. Then she looks at the empty seat of Adam’s, “Adam must be dating now. He really takes love more seriously than friendship.”
	Nana and Jamie walks into the elevator, pressing down the bottom for the Canteen’s floor.
	“ Are you and Adam close?” Jamie asks.
	“ He and I know each other when we were children, so we grew up together. Back at that time, he followed me all the time.” Nana recalls her memory.
	Jamie watches at the changing number on the elevator’s screen, also recalls her memory that makes her smile.
	The Staff Canteen is big, covering the whole floor with many round tables. Though it’s in day time, the orange lights are still on.
	Nana and Jamie finds somewhere quiet and sits down for lunch. Peoples in the The peaole in canteen keep talking about Jamie, for Jamie got inside to the president office yesterday.
	Foods in C&R are really good, they even provide fruit and desserts. However, Jamie would have a better lunch if she is not being discussed by people now.
	Now Jamie loses her appetite, she can’t enjoy the foods at all.
	Lowing down her head gloomily, and poking the rice in her bowl, Jamie doesn’t know what happens in the Canteen until Nana kicks her quietly.
	Jamie looks up and sees Dan is sitting across. And Nana has already run away because of Dan.
	Dan puts his arms around his chest, leading one the seat cozily.
	The elegant and noble temperament of Dan hasn’t diminished a bit, even though he just sits there.
	“Pre..president William?” Jamie stares at Dan in shock.
	Nana said that he never comes to the Staff Canteen, what happens now?
	Dan frowns, looking colder. Jamie is frozen immaterially, she doesn’t dare to move at all.
	All the people have been driven out by Dan’s assistant, so there are only Jamie and Dan in the Canteen.
Chapter 23 Treat her as she treated yme 2
	“From now one, go to the Royal Hotel at the lunch break.” Dan watches Jamie for a while. Though he said in cold tone, his eyes show care for Jamie.
	“What for?” Jamie asks, but she doesn’t expect that Dan will answer.
	“You will suffer the consequences if you come late or no come at all.” Dan clearly wasn’t going to answer Jamie’s question. He leaves with the assistant after he said what he need to say.
	Jamie hasn’t realized what happened after a while, poking hardly on the rice with her chopsticks. Why she can’t shape up herself in front of Dan. Jamie thinks.
	When Jack goes back to the office, Nana and Adam are both inside beside Emily. Jamie notices that they look at her with curiosity, she asks,” What’s the matters?”
	Nana looks at outside quickly, seeing there is no body outside. She gets close to Jamie and asks,” Do tell us, why the president came to find you purposely? Are you two already known each other?” Adam also looks at Jamie with gossipy eyes.
	Jamie denies immediately. She doesn’t want them think that she can get in C&R because of Dan, which is not good to her, neither to Dan.
	Of course not. You think too much. The president just looks after the newbie.” Jamie turns on her computer, entering passing with poker face.
	“Come on, just stop it! We have never seen the president looking after newbies. Judging from today’s situation, you and the president must know each other. Words should be spreading all over the company now.” Nana doesn’t believe what Jamie just said, but she stops asking. She notices that Jamie doesn’t want to discuss about this.
	“It’s time for work.” Jamie begins to draw and design.
	Adam and Nana looks at each other, shrugging their shoulder, then goes back to the seat.
	Though Jamie is not fast at drawing, but new ideas keep showing up in her mind, which makes her devoted herself into work.
	“Oh my god. I’m sorry. I was a bit dizzy, and splashes the water accidentally.” Emily says in pretending.
	Jamie sees that her work becomes vague due to the water. It’s clear to Jamie that Emily is doing purposely.
	“So sorry about this. I’m afraid you need to redraw it. Not much time left, you need to work late tonight.” Emily looks at Jamie viciously, covering her mouth smiling.
	Jamie smiles, then she picks up her cup and splashes to Emily.
	After she splashed Emily. Jamie pretends to be surprised,” Oh, I’m sorry. My hand is slippery, and splashes the water to you accidentally. I’m afraid you need to redo your make-up.”
	Jamie still acts innocently after she said everything.
	Witnessing this, Adam and Nana wants to laugh but dare not, they keep controlling themselves.
	For all the time, only Emily can trick other, no one has ever tricked her. But today, Emily gets trick from Jamie for the first time.
	And this is awesome!
	If it is water, then it’s better for Emily. But what Jamie splashed to Emily is milk.
	The milk keeps dripping down from Emily’s hair, messing up her blush. One of Emily’s fake eyelashes also comes off, Emily looks like a mess right now.
	“ How dare you to splash me with milk!” Emily looks at Jamie viciously, raising her hand to slap Jamie.
	There is no way for Jamie to bear it. Jamie has offended Emily already, so she doesn’t mind to offend her thoroughly.
	
Chapter 24 I send you home 1
	Jamie is not someone that anybody can pick on.
	She steps aside to avoid, then pushes Emily. Emily falls on her face losing balance.
	“Ah!” Emily screams. Adam and Nana can’t control themselves anymore, bursting into laughter.
	Jamie doesn’t feel good for paying back, she feels sorry for Emily instead.
	Emily stands up weaving, clenching her hands hardly. She notices her dress is broken, staring at Jamie, Emily says,” I will make you pay for this.” Then she leaves the office quickly.
	“ Good job, Jamie!” Nana looks to Jamie adoring.
	Thinking of what happened to Emily, Nana feels so good and satisfied. However, Jamie doesn’t feel the same. After all, her drawing is ruined.
	“The draft has to be handed over tomorrow morning. Director is very stint about this. How about we stay and help?” Looking at the ruined draft, Adam feels pity for that.
	“ It’s fine. I can handle it. You guys go first after finishing your work. I will finish mine quickly.” Jamie says.
	“Really? Are you okay on your own?” Nana asks concernedly. Jamie has spent almost the entire day to draw the draft, but it gets ruined by Emily.
	“Really, I can manage on my own.” Jamie pulls out a piece of paper, getting ready to start again.
	Seeing this, Adam and Nana doesn’t say anything else to bother Jamie. They leave when it’s time to leave.
	The first time when you draft, a great sense of achievement will appear. But when you draft the same thing in second time, all you feel is vapid, and this is exactly how Jamie feels now.
	Time passes. Jamie calls Ian to let him know that she will be late tonight, then she concentrates on the draft.
	“President, it’s time to leave. “ Assistant Zhang puts the documents on Dan’s desk.
	Dan rubs his temple and takes a look at the clock, it’s already 18:30pm.
	All of CR's employees should be home from work now, if they don't work overtime.
	She must have left as well. Dan thinks.
	Dan suddenly feels annoyed, then he waves his hand to the assistant.
	Assistant Zhang nods, leaves the office respectfully.
	Turning off the computer, Dan leaves his office with his coat.
	Night falls, lights in the C&R company gradually turn off, only the lights on where Jamie is still lighting.
	Walking into the elevator, Dan was supposed to go straight to the first floor. But he presses down the 12nd floor unconsciously.
	Watching the changing numbers, Dan’s temperament turns from cold to soft.
	The elevator stops at the 12rd floor, Dan walks out of the elevator and goes to the designers’ office.
	Inside the office.
	Jamie stops drawing and rubs her sore arm. Watching the drafts on the table, she should be able to finish before 9pm with this speed.
	Cold night, the wind blows inside to the office, chilling Jamie. But Jamie is too lazy to close the window, she almost finishes anyway.
	A coat covers on Jamie, with slight smell of mint. Jamie stops and looks up to see who is coming?
	It’s Dan!
	Dan looks at Jamie with his arms covering around his chest. The moonlight shines on him like a veil, making Dan looked soft.
	Jamie actually sees gentleness from Dan’s face.
	“President William” Jamie stands up and says dully.
Chapter 25 I send you home 2
	He should leave already, why is he here? Jamie thinks.
	Dan looks cold again, as if the gentleness before is just an illusion. He looks at the draft on Jamie’s desk, asks,” Haven’t finished your work?”
	“Yes.” Jamie stands in awkwardness. She doesn’t know where to look at, so she can only looks down to her feet.
	Dan glances around and finds few papers are in the bin. Those should be the unqualified works, but they seem to be wet. Dan thinks.
	“Continue.” Dan says.
	Jamie takes a look at Dan, and finds him sit on the sofa already. Jamie has doubt, but she needs to finish her draft first.
	Jamie hasn’t started long, then she feels someone is watching her. She knows it’s Dan, but that makes her felt uncomfortable, so Jamie looks up to watch back.
	However, Jamie only sees that Dan is reading the newspaper, his sight seems fixed on it, not her.
	Jamie frowns with doubt, did she just have illusion? She thinks. Then Jamie focus on the draft again.
	Dan’s eyes turns away from the side of the newspaper and looks at Jamie, who is working hard, then there is a light smile on his lips.
	Maybe it’s because of the awkward atmosphere, Jamie finishes her draft at 8:30.
	Tidy up her desk, stretching out. Jamie doesn’t know what to do next.
	Dan is still reading the paper.
	Jamie want to tell Dan that she is going to leave, but seeing how concentrated Dan is, Jamie is afraid of disturbing him. If Dan gets mad of that, it will be the worst.
	Thinking of what Shawn said, “If you provoke the president, the entire company will suffer”, Jamie doesn’t have the gut to talk to Dan. She doesn’t know what to do.
	Dan glances to Jamie, seeing how Jamie is in hesitation. He decides to trick Jamie.
	Dan doesn’t say a word, and he wants to see how long Jamie can last without asking.
	It’s 9pm now.
	Jamie frowns and looks at Dan. Dan still pretends to read the newspaper.
	“President William, it’s already 9 o’ clock.” Jamie says.
	“I know.” Dan answers and keeps reading.
	“Don’t you need to go home?’ Jamie gets hurried when she sees Dan is still calm and relaxed.
	Of course Dan understands what Jamie means. Is that because someone is waiting her home? That’s why she is in hurried? Dan thinks.
	Frowning and feeling jealous, Dan puts down the newspaper and walks out the office, “Leave now.”
	Jamie feels glad, putting her draft into her bag. She follows along.
	Inside the elevator.
	Dan leans against the elevator, thinking.
	Jamie stands behind him and looks at Dan. Smiling bitterly.
	He is Ian’s father, but I can’t never let him know this secret.
	Ding. The elevator reaches the first floor.
	“Goodbye, president William.” Jamie says to Dan and tries to walk out from the elevator.
	Dan grabs her wrist and says, “ I drive you home.” “It’s late now, you can’t call a taxi here.” Dan says in supplementary.
Chapter 26 Daddy?! 1
	Jamie looks at her watch, it’s late now. So she says,” Then thanks a lot, president William.”
	“Okay.” Dan keeps grabbing Jamie’s wrist, walking towards to the underground parking lot.
	Ian witnesses his Mommy is sending back to home in the same car, Ian has so many doubts. Seeing the car is leaving, he keeps watching, and finds that the car is driving in a total opposite way to Pennis House.
	On the way? How can this be on the way? This person must want something from Mommy.
	What is really weird is that Mommy takes the hitchhike every time. If they are really just normal coworkers, Mommy wouldn’t have accepted that. Ian thinks.
	The second Jamie walks into the house, Ian comes down from the window immediately. Holding his hands on the back and walking to Jamie, “Mommy.”
	Jamie kisses Ian, putting down her bag on sofa, and getting a drink.
	“Mommy, who is the man that sent you home?” Ian puts his hands on the table, and his chin leans above his hands.
	Jamie’s hand shakes a bit, watching Ian nervously,” Have you seen his face?”
	“No. But I know he wants something from you.” Ian shakes his head.
	Jamie relieves, squeezing Ian’s checks and says,” Don’t say this ridiculous thing. It’s late now, have you taken a shower yet? You need to go to bed now.”
	“The school is giving us day off tomorrow. I want to play for a while.” Ian says.
	“What kind of school it is, always taking day off.” Jamie says.
	Come on, Ian just went to school for few days.
	“The teachers told us about that. Mommy, you just go to take shower, I have prepared everything you need on the bathroom.” Ian says.
	“My baby is the best. What can I do if I live without you.” Jamie thinks of Dan. With the thought that if Dan finds out about Ian, Jamie doesn’t know that how she will react on this.
	When Jamie is taking a shower, Ian carries his back-up phone and runs into his room, with door locked.
	He finds Wendy on the Wechat list.
	Ian types, “ Are you there? Auntie Wendy?”
	Wendy replies quickly,” Are you talking to me? Jamie?”
	Ian sends a speechless emoji, and types,” I’m Ian. Auntie Wendy.”
	“No wonder. I just thinks that why Jamie calls me Auntie Wendy. What’s going on, Ian? Do you miss Auntie Wendy?” Wendy sends the messages with lots of kissing emoji.
	“Of course, I do. I have some questions want to ask you.” Ian sends back. Auntie Wendy knows everything about Mommy. She is the right one for him to ask.
	“Just say it.. I will tell you everything I know.” Wendy says.
	“Does Auntie Wendy know any romantic relationship about Mommy?” Ian asks.
	Romantic relationship? Wendy stays silent. Does your Mommy know that you are so mature? Wendy thinks. Ian waits for a while, but gets no response from Wendy. Ian knows that there must be something in it.
	“Ian promises that I won’t tell Mommy about this. It’s a secret between Ian and Auntie Wendy. Please tell me.” Ian types with sad emoji.
	“Okay. But this is a secret between us.” Wendy gives up. She doesn’t want to make Ian cried.
	In Wendy’s view, Ian is just a child, doesn’t know a thing.
	But Wendy never thinks deeply that how can a four-year-old child notice so much details, and even can play Wechat.
	
Chapter 27 Daddy 2
	Ian looks through the information Wendy sent. At the same time, he keeps an eye on the bathroom. After he reads all the information, he deletes then all, then walks out his room.
	Ian is putting back his back-up phone is hiding place, when someone suddenly says,” There is only one truth!” , which scares Ian. He turns around, and finds out that it’s Detective Conan on the TV.
	Ian presses the pause, and says towards to the bathroom,” Mommy, I’m tired. I will go to bed first.”
	“Okay.” Jamie responses.
	Ian goes to his room quickly and locks the door. Jumping into his bed with his note book.
	After Ian turns on his computer, he starts to search Dan William in the internet.
	All the news and information doesn’t have much to look into. Basic information, few photos of Dan’s without showing his face, and C&R company is the original William Company. Beside these, Ian gets nothing.
	It’s very clear that someone has stops and blocked most of the information.
	Auntie Wendy says Ian looks almost exactly the same with Dan. So, it’s very possible that Dan is his Daddy. Ian thinks.
	Daddy?! It’s a strange and unfamiliar word to Ian.
	“Ian, opens the door. Mommy can’t sleep alone tonight.” Jamie ‘s knocking stops Ian from thinking.
	I can check tomorrow, don’t need to go to school anyway. Ian thinks.
	Then he puts away his note book and opens the door. Jamie looks pity to Ian. She says in regret,” I shouldn’t watch the Detective Conan, scares the hell out of me.”
	Ian doesn’t make any comment for what Jamie said. After all, Jamie says the same thing every time after she watches the show.
	Ian locks the door and gets into his bed. Jan hugs him like cuddling a cushion.
	“Mommy. Did I really come out from a watermelon when you tried to cut one?” Ian asks in curiosity.
	Jamie answers in dazed,” yes..I even took a picture.”
	Ian doesn’t believe at all. But he will find out the truth tomorrow, Ian thinks.
	The next day.
	Jamie doesn’t get up early like usual, but gets up at almost 9am. Then she freshens up in hurry and goes to work.
	When Ian is seeing Jamie left, his face is saying ‘I will miss you’. But when Jamie leaves, that pity look disappears. Locking the door, Ian takes out his note book and starts to plan.
	Ian types on the computer fast, concentrating on the screen. It doesn’t take much time for him to finish his plan.
	Done!
	Inside the president office.
	Dan sits behind the desk with an exquisite pen between his fingers. Looking at the distance.
	“President William?President William?” Assistant Zhang hands over the documents for Dan to sign after he finishes his report,
	She’s not suppose to urge Dan, but the documents are emergent. So the assistant has to risk to try.
	Dan looks at the assistant unpleasantly. Looking through the document, then he signs.
	Assistant Zhang is scared by the look. But she recovers herself quickly.After all, she has been Dan’s assistant for eight years, building up some resistant ability already.
	“ president William. If there is nothing else you need, then I will leave.” the assistant says.
	“ Wait. Ask Shawn to bring me the design draft of this week.” Dan says suddenly.
	
Chapter 28 Daddy and a son 1
	“Is there anythingg wrong?” The assistant asks. Because the president won’t take a look at the draft unless the nominated ones.
	The assistant regrets for asking immediately, lowering down her head, “Sorry, president. I shouldn’t ask. I will let them bring the draft here.”
	Dan doesn’t say a word, waving his hand to let the assistant leave.
	The office is quiet, only the sound of typing on the keyboards can be heard.
	Dan keeps looking at the screen, typing fast on the keyboards. Suddenly, he stops, cos all threes computer blackout simultaneously.
	Seeing the blackout screen, Dan frowning hardly. Suddenly, a few white and fatty bottle gourds appear on the screen. Is the computes getting hacked? Dan thinks.
	Before Dan figures out what is happening, the camera turns on, and his face is on the screen. Gloomy and frightening. Dan wants to find out who dares to hack his computer.
	On the other hand, Ian saves the pictures quickly, and begins to observe.
	Though the person on the picture looks gloomy, he still looks handsome. His eyes, his nose and his face, is like a grow-up version of me. Ian thinks.
	What Auntie Wendy said is true. This person is his Daddy!
	It turns out that I’m not come out from the watermelon when Mommy was cutting one. Ian is so happy and excited. He keeps typing down words on the computer.
	Dan keeps working on the hacking, and the screens become normal again.
	But just in a second, the bottle gourds show on the screen again. This time, the bottle gourds are not all in white, but mixes with the purple one.
	“Kiss Daddy!” A purple gourd in the middle of screen is showing the two terrifying words.
	And the little gourd wears a smile, which makes Dan so furious that he almost squeezes the mouse into pieces.
	Daddy? Is he going to have an extra son just because someone calls him Daddy?
	This is the first time that Dan gets provoked like that. Dan starts to fight back.
	Ian is shocked when he realizes Dan is fighting back. He is certainly my Daddy, his computer skill is as good as me. Ian thinks.
	But I’m really your son! Ian types these words out of fun. Ian can call him Daddy freely as long as Jamie knows nothing about this.
	But who he really is can’t be found out by Daddy, cos this isn’t what Mommy wants. And I have to listen to Mommy’s order. Ian thinks.
	Dan sneers when he sees the words. When he is about to reply, someone knocks the door.
	“Come in.” Dan says while he stares at the computer.
	Dan gets replied fast. He could never think that the one who hacks his computer is only a four years old child, and it’s his son indeed.
	“President William.” It is very uncomfortable to listen to the cutesy voice.
	Dan looks up and sees it’s not Assistant Zhang who has come in, frowning hardly, asks coldly, “Who told that you can come in?”
	It’s Emily standing in front of Dan. Shawn asks her to bring the drafts to the president office, and she takes the job gladly.
	After she knocked the door, president said ‘come in’ unexpectedly. So Emily walks in with joy. But now Dan acts like this, which makes Emily a bit nervous and scared.
	However, Emily still smiles in the most enchanting way, looking at Dan with adoration, “ The director asks me to bring the draft to you.”
	“Get out!” Dan says coldly.
	Beside the assistant, there is only one person who can come inside to his office.
	And that person can only be Jamie.
	
Chapter 29 Daddy and a son 2
	“President William...” Emily says sadly, hoping that Dan will show some pity on her.
	“Don’t let me repeat again.” Dan says.
	To maintain her good impression to Dan, Emily decides to leave.
	“Wait.” Dan thinks of the draft.
	Emily turns and walks back in surprise, she knows it! Dan cares her.
	“President William.” Emily says.
	“The drafts.” Dan says.
	Emily hands over the draft in hurry.
	Dan looks through the draft but doesn’t see Jamie’s, he frowns,” Missing.”
	“What?” Emily is too occupied at watching Dan to react in time.
	Dan throws the draft into Emily’s face, scolds, “This is how you do your job?”
	Emily is too scare to breathe, recalling what Dan said before. Missing? Whose?
	Jamie! Emily realizes that she took out Jamie’s work purposely to prevent the president from looking. She thought that the president won’t pay much attention on a new staff.
	“Sorry, president. I will go to check right now.” the dress Emily wears has deep collar. When she bows down to apologize purposely, her cleavage shows clearly.
	Dan glance at her coldly and says, “ Get out!”
	Emily is shocked and scared, fleeing in hurry. With the thought that it’s all because of Jamie, Emily’s hatred towards Jamie becomes more.
	The strong perfume lingers in the air, which makes Dan felt disgusting. The second Emily left, Dan also walks out from the office.
	Ian is a bit sad for doesn’t get the reply from Dan. But with the thinking that Dan has to manage the C&R company, he must be very busy. Then Ian relieves.
	“President William.” Assistant Zhang lowers her head respectfully when she sees Dan comes out from the office.
	“Go to tidy up the office. I don’t want that disgusting smell in the office.” Dan says in cold, and then walks into the elevator.
	Assistant Zhang doesn’t know what just happened. She walks into the office, feeling puzzled. The moment she walks into the office, a strong smell of famine perfume comes to her. And the assistant goes to open the window in hurry.
	Dan comes down the the designers’ office on the 12rd floor, his eyes fixes on that little woman.
	Adam finds Dan come in firstly, standing up to greet.
	Dan takes a glance, then frowns. There’s a man in the office? He doesn’t greet back to Adam.
	However, Adam is very excited to see the legend of the C&R company. It’s his pleasure to see him in flesh.
	Nana also stands up and greets with a smile,” President William.”
	Dan nods. A woman, not a threat. He thinks.
	Dan walks to Jamie. Seeing Jamie lowering down her head with her hands supporting her chin, which looks like she is dozing.
	Dan smiles, and looks at Jamie softly.
	Adam and Nana looks at each other. Both think that there is something between them!
	Actually, Jamie is not dozing but thinking about ideas, just looks like that she is dozing.
	Oh, no! Nana thinks. The president is always strict, even harsh. If he finds out Jamie is dozing, Jamie will get fired!
	I can’t let that happens, Nana is coming up with an idea.
	Nana kicks Jamie’s desk secretly, not too hard, but hard enough to wake Jamie.
	Jamie is waked by the shaking of her desk. Looking up, she finds Dan is standing in front of her. Jamie can’t be more in shock.
	Dame it! Why is he here? Jamie thinks.
	“Pre..president William.” Jamie stands up quickly, lowering down her head. She is afraid to look at Dan.
Chapter 30 It’s not fair 1
	Does he think that I was dozingt? What should I do now?! Jamie thinks
	Dan says, “I come for your draft, yours is missing.”
	Adam and Nana who are eavesdropping can’t stay clam anymore. The president comes to collect the draft himself?
	Is that a joke?
	“I already handed it over to the director.” Jamie answers.
	Jamie feels confused. She has already put the draft on the director’s desk, and Emily saw it that time.
	Emily! Jamie frowns, did Emily have something to do with this?
	Dan sees Jamie’s face, knowing that something is wrong.
	“Then why does it only lack of your draft?” Emily says suddenly.
	“Maybe someone is playing tricks behind my back.” Jamie smiles with a sneer, looking at Emily.
	“So much excuses.” Emily talks back.
	Dan glances through Emily, then he speaks to Adam and Nana, “You two, One goes searching the office and finds out Jamie’s draft. Another one goes to pull out the camera’s footage.”
	“Yes, president.” Adam and Nana acts separately
	Emily’s face turns pale. Jamie’s draft is still on her desk, and when does the office have camera, why she didn’t know about this...
	Jamie sees how pale Emily looks like, knowing for sure that it’s her playing tricks. Jamie doesn’t have much good feels toward Emily already. Now it’s even worse.
	Dan sits on the sofa, glancing Emily coldly from time to time.
	In the normal time, Emily would have be so excited for Dan’s attention. But now, she only wants to flee.
	“Found it!” Nana found the draft from Emily’s office.
	Jamie finally relaxes when she gets back her draft. Luckily, the draft doesn’t get destroyed.
	“Do you have anything else want to say?” Jamie walks to Emily, staring at her coldly.
	“Who knows if you put the draft on my desk purposely, to set me up?” Emily talks back.
	Emily knows that she can’t lose her face to Jamie, especially in front of Dan!
	Both parties are in stablemate when Adam walks in. He hands the USB disk to Dan, “President William. Here’s the camera’s footage.”
	Dan takes the USB dish, standing up and walking to Jamie’s computer.
	“Don’t play it!” Emily suddenly screams.
	She knows that when the footage is played, her lies will be exposed.
	“What? Feels guilty?” Nana says mockingly.
	Biting her lips, Emily lowers her head, doesn’t speak at all.
	“If I don’t remember ,wrongly, your father is one of the boarding member of the Kent Company?” Dan sits on Jamie’s seat, taping the desk with his fingers.
	Dan changes the subject so fast, even Jamie can’t follow up at first.
	“Ye...Yes.” Emily is confused, she doesn’t understand why he talks about this suddenly.
	“Good. Cancel all the cooperation with the Kent Company from now.” Dan says.
	Hearing this, Emily looks at Dan unbelievably.
	“President William. I don’t understand. The reason why you do this is just because I hid Jamie’s draft? It’s not fair!” Emily points to Jamie, saying angrily.
	Even Jamie is shocked too. Is Dan defending for her?
	“When can you question my decision?” Dan says with a cold smile.
	Fair? What is fair? Jamie is the standard of fairness! Dan thinks.
	Emily lost, not only to Jamie, but also to the stubborn protection, which Dan gives to Jamie.
	
Chapter 31 It’s not fair 2
	Nana looks at Dan adorably. Wow! The president is so manly. She feels a butterfly is flying on her stomach.
	“Okay, I know.” Emily turns around and leaves the office desperately.
	Dan doesn’t fire Emily. From his view. Those who pick on Jamie, can’t be easily let go.
	The office remains in silence until Dan says, “the draft.”
	Jamie hands over her draft with a smile. She is always confident toward her design.
	However, Dan turns more and more gloomy when he looks through the draft.
	“Follow me.” Dan says expressionlessly and leaves the office.
	Jamie follows Dan to the president office, asks, “Is there anything wrong with my design? President William?”
	The inspiration of these designs all comes from her life and experiences, they shouldn’t have much problems. Jamie thinks.
	Dan turns on his back-up computer, taping on it for a while, then he turns the screen to Jamie with concern that is hard to notice.
	“These are the clothes designed by F&S, Miss R.” Dan says.
	Designs on the screen are all Jamie’s work when she was in F&S. Though only small amount of them, every women in fashion circle crazy for them. After all, it’s a dream to every woman that wearing clothes designed by Miss R is the most happiness thing in the world.
	Jamie looks at Dan with confusion.
	“You know better than me of what a designer scares the most. If your design is on the market, F&S won’t take it easily about this.” Dan says. He doesn’t care about the F&S Company, but he cares about Jamie’s fame.
	Copy and plagiary are the most scared things for designers. He means that I’m a copy cat? Jamie really wants to laugh. So, I’m copying from myself? Jamie thinks.
	“If I’m telling you that I’m actually Miss R?” Jamie looks at Dan calmly.
	“Then I believe you.” Dan smiles.
	Comparing to plagiarize, Dan believes that Jamie is the Miss R.
	Jamie is surprised for how easy Dan believe in her.
	“Have you visited the Moore yet?” Dan closes the note book, and opens the others.
	“No.” Jamie answers. She doesn’t understand why he suddenly brings up the Moore.
	“Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Moores’ Company, and I need a female companion.” Dan says.
	What Dan said is clear, you go with me.
	“Okay.” Jamie answers.
	Jamie’s heart is beating fast now. She really wants to slap herself, why are you still shy? You already have a baby with him! Jamie thinks.
	“Also, to prevent the same thing from happening. From now on, you hand over your draft directly to me.” It seems like that Dan is looking after for Jamie, but he actually wants an excuse to see Jamie everyday.
	“What?” Jamie shocks, and her face turns reddish.
	That means she has to see him everyday? Jamie thinks.
	Dan smiles, “Why your face blushes?”
	“No! I’m not.” Jamie feels embarrassing and talks back.
	Dan turns from smiling to laughing.
	Watching Dan like this, which makes Jamie become more embarrassing. She wants to find a hole and hide herself in it.
	“If you keep laughing like that, I will throw you out from here!” Jamie says fiercely.
	
Chapter 32 Your privilege 1
	Dan isn’t angry about this, but laughs more happily, “You don’t need to be constrained in front of me. This is your privilege.”
	The night of the anniversary celebration of the Moore Company. The Royal Hotel is boisterous.
	The party almost begins, and almost all guests arrived.
	Suddenly, the door is opened, attracting all attentions. A heaven-made match appears.
	The man wears hand-made Italian black suit with great body shape and dazzling eyes. His facial structure is perfect, liking a sculpture. The natural born elegance and royals beams from the man, though he is barely standing there.
	Peoples all recognize the man is Dan.
	In Leeds, Dan is the representative of wealth, power and appearance.
	Naturally, Jamie who stands next to Dan, gets lots of attention too. Not only because she is beautiful, but she is the first female companion accompanying Dan to occasion like this in the pass five years.
	Jamie today wears an ice-blue shoulder-less full-dress. The ice-blue makes Jamie’s skin white and smooth like milk. Up-doing her hair, with couples pearls as decoration, Jamie attracts all the attention of the male guests. Dan suddenly regrets bring Jamie here.
	Looking at Jamie’s standard smiling, Dan even finds that uncomfortable, “put away your false smile.”
	Jamie frowns and looks at Dan with confusion. Isn’t he asked me to keep smiling? What’s going on with him now? Jamie thinks.
	Anyways, Jamie puts away her smile. Her face almost goes numb because of keeping smiling.
	Jack Moore walks to Dan in hurry, “President William. It’s been a long time.”
	Dan feels Jamie got a bit nervous, looking at Jack, “Do you still remember this lady, president Moore.”
	Jack always wants to flatter Dan and leaves him a good impression. Now, Dan asks actively, which surprised Jack a lot.
	“She looks familiar, may I know whose daughter is she?” Clearly Jack doesn’t recognize Jamie.
	Dan looks at Jack in cold, smiling sneeringly.
	“Your memory severs you well, president William. You can’t even recognize your own daughter.” Dan says loudly, peoples around him hear clearly.
	What kind of loser he is, can’t even recognize his own daughter. People around look at Jack with a bit despite.
	Jack stares at Jamie in shock. After all, Jamie was disguised as a man five years ago. Now without the disguises, Jack couldn’t recognize her out at the first place.
	Jack says, “Jamie, you left five years ago without a word. No calls, no letters for us, I can barely recognize you.”
	Jamie feels nothing for what Jack said but ridiculous. The whipping from five years ago has cut off all their relationship already.
	“Dad.”
	A woman dresses in red walks toward here with her mother, wearing a proper smile, from where Jamie reads arrogant. It’s Mia and her mother Celina. Jamie has met them once many years ago, they’re also the mistress and love child of Jack’s.
	Back to the years in Spain, Jamie heard some news about the Moore family from Chris.
Chapter 33 Your privilege 2
	After Jamie left the country, Jacqueline got Aids because of her sexual relationship. And the whole upper class knew about this.
	It was a huge scan to the Moore family. Jack gave up on Jacqueline directly. Jacqueline passed away later, and Catherine couldn’t deal with this and got mental problems, abandoning into the hospital. After that, Jack has brought Mia home, and married Celina.
	Jamie has nothing to say with them. She and Dan goes aside when others are focusing on Mia and Celina.
	In Pennies House.
	Ian sits on the sofa. He keeps giggling and eating chips while he looks at his note book.
	A micro-camera is inserted in Jamie’s necklace by Ian, so Ian can see clearly what happens on the party.
	So, how his Daddy gets mad for others men looks at Mommy, Ian sees that clearly too.
	Daddy is really care about Mommy, Ian thinks.
	Runs out of chips, Ian is going to get more.
	Doesn’t want to miss any show, Dan goes in hurry. Without notice, he steps on the empty bottle, and falls on his stomach.
	Ian stands up from the ground and wants to go to the kitchen. But he feels something weird around his chest, so he drags out the necklace underneath his clothes.
	Jamie gave the necklace to Ian when he was three, it’s said the Jamie’s mother gave it to Jamie, which means a lots to Jamie.
	Watching the necklace broken into two parts, Ian feels remorse.
	Jamie told Ian before that the necklace can protect him, which is important to Ian and Jamie, but now Ian broken it.
	When Ian is thinking about how to fix the necklace, he finds out that the necklace is empty inside, and something is in it.
	Ian breaks the pendant, a collapsible ring and a note are hidden inside.
	The ring is black with patterns, caring a letter, N.
	Ian surprises, is this a secret ring? Then Ian opens the note. A series numbers written on it, looks like a cell phone number, and an address is attaching.
	When Ian is trying to call that number, Jamie gets into troubles.
	Holding Jamie and a tray full of food, Dan heads to the corner.
	“President William. It’s been a long time.” Mia smiles flirting and walks toward to Dan. She looks at Dan eagerly, but looks at Jamie with jealousy and despite.
	Dan frowns a bit, doesn’t even look at Mia.
	Mia feels embarrassing for a second. But then, she walks to another side of Dan, and touches Dan from time to time without getting noticed.
	“President William, I miss you so much. Why you don’t reach out for me?” Mia says in the tone that makes Jamie’s gooses bump up.
	Dan looks around Jamie, and then smiles to Mia suddenly.
	Mia shocks and then turns exciting, her heart beating fast also. Is he just smiled to me? Mia thinks.
	Jamie happens to see Dan smiling to Mia, and she feels sad about it. But she keeps smiling, acting like everything is okay.
	
Chapter 34 I Won’t spare you easily 1
	Smile fading away, Dan is sneering.
	But Mia is already all over herself. She walks to Jamie, and says despising, “Brother, no. Sister, it’s been a long time. You look exactly the same. Just with different gender, everything else, especially your personality, doesn’t change a bit.”
	“That’s true. Unlike someone, no matter how she changes, it doesn’t help at all.” Jamie says with a bit sly smile.
	Mia looks at Jamie viciously, she is so angry that she squeezes the wine glass so hard. However, because Dan is here, Mia isn’t dare to trick Jamie.
	Mia walks closer to Jamie with her wine, her legs suddenly bend and she falls upfront. The wine aims to Jamie, while Mia herself aims to Dan.
	Jamie sneers. So classic, Mia. Willing to do anything just to trick her. Jamie thinks.
	Before Jamie reacts to this, Dan has already pulled her into his arm. Jamie can only see his jaw when she looks up. And she feels that her heart stops beating for a second.
	What Mia is planning failed, she ends up falling on the ground in a weird way. It looks like that she has a terrible fall.
	No one dares to help Mia. After all, Mia was trying to trick Dan’s female companion. Helping Mia means up-against with Dan.
	Jack and Celina doesn’t know what happens. But seeing Mia failed, they help her up.
	Mia’s forehead is bleeding, looking like a mess.
	Celina sees how hard her daughter failed, but Jamie keeps safe and sound. She points at Jamie and swears, “I know nothing good will happen once you come back. How dare you to trick your sister? You are such a heartless person. What people says is true. A child without her mother’s guidance, acts no good.” The party turns into silence. Clearly everyone is enjoying to watch the little drama.
	Jamie’s face turns pale, and looks at the ground. No one wants what she is thinking right now.
	But Dan has already taped down Celina’s hand, “Watch your mouth. You’re not qualified enough to judge. If your daughter had been raised like you, I'm afraid she would have gone long time ago.”
	Celina is so mad that her body is shaking. She doesn’t dare to do anything to Dan. So she is going to lease her anger to Jamie.
	Mia is so happy when she sees that her mother is going to slap Jamie.
	“Stop!” Jack shouts.
	After all, Jamie comes with Dan. If Celina really slaps Jamie, which is slapping Dan equally.
	But Celina is too mad to listen to Jack, she is still going to slap Jamie.
	With anger and furious, Dan kicks Celina hardly. So hard that Celina can’t even stand on her feet.
	Jamie doesn’t realize that Dan will hit the Moores for her. So does Mia.
	Mia could never think that Dan will hit her mother for Jamie.
	Dan doesn’t care about what others will think, looking cold to the Moores, “The Moore family, it’s really something.”
	Jack alerts, is Dan going to?! Without thinking, Jack runs to Celina and slaps her right in her face,” Jamie is a child of our Moore family. You are the hostess of the family. How can you acts so mean. Go to apologize to Jamie.”
	By acting like this, firstly, Jack wants to ease Dan’s anger. Secondly, Jack implies that Jamie is also one of the Moore family. If Dan turns against the Moore family, he is equally turning against with Jamie.
	
Chapter 35 I Won’t spare you easily 2
	Mia is confused. She didn’t think that Jack will hit her mother. Isn’t Jamie the one who responsible for all of these?
	“Ah! I would rather die than apologize to that bitch!” Celina was slapped on the public, feeling so injustice already. How could she apologize to Jamie.
	Jack was just acting back then, but now he really wants to slap Celina, this silly woman.
	Jamie has no interest in watching their internal drama, she tells Dan, “I will go to use the lady room.”
	“I’ll go with you.” Dan says immediately.
	Jamie’s face turns from pale to blush, stares at Dan, “Why will I need a man to accompany me to the lady room!? I will be back soon!” Then she turns around and lefts. Leaving Dan alone angrily.
	Inside the lady room.
	Jamie freshens up in front of the mirror. Mia shows up behind Jamie’s back suddenly.
	“The silly thing you have done before was spread all over the upper class. How dare you to come back?” Mia holds her arms around her chest, looking at Jamie arrogantly with her chin.
	“What do you want to say?” Jamie says.
	Mia walks closer to Jamie, “Just because Brother William treats you nice, doesn’t mean that he likes you. You can go check how many scandals I have with him for all these years.”
	“Brother William? So intimate. Why don’t you call him like this in front of him? I bet you’re not dare to do so. So, you’re not special to him.” Jamie talks back with her chin holding high.
	Mia gets exposed on her weak spot, her arrogant disguise falls apart.
	“You and your mother are the same, both of you enjoy to get man that is already spoken for. Why do you think your mother jumped off the building? Out of shame! Jacqueline just said something about your mother, and she was too weak to handle then she jumped. How ridiculous she was!”
	“What are you saying?’ Jacqueline has something to do with mother’s death?
	Jamie can’t believe any of these. She grabs Mia’s arm, “Tell me what happened exactly.”
	Mia sneers, “Your mother was already burnt into dust, you still want to revenge for her?”
	Jamie feels hurt badly by Mia’s words.
	Mother’s death is always a trauma to Jamie. She can’t bear others still talking bad about mother after she dead.
	With furious, Jamie slaps Mia hardly.
	“This is for your words came out without thinking.” Jamie says in cold. Then she slaps Mia again with her right hand, “This, is for you talking bad toward my mother. If you keep trying to cross my bottom line, I won’t let go of you easily.” Jamie is so fiercely, just like a queen.
	Ian watches all through the Micro-camera, he applause to Jamie in excitement. Well done! Mommy. Ian thinks. Then, Ian presses down a bottom, smiling trickily.
	Suddenly, color fluid flashes out from Jamie’s necklace, spraying directly to Mia.
	Jamie looks down to her necklace, she doesn’t understand why the necklace will flash out fluid.
Chapter 36 I don’t need your concern 1
	Jamie realizes it’s Ian’s work. Can’t help to praise Ian in her mind.
	“Ah!” Mia covers her eyes, while she bends down screaming. She finds her way to the hand basin, and waters her eyes, to decrease some pain.
	Watering for a long time, Mia’s eyes recovers from pain.
	Looking up to the mirror, Mia finds herself still covered the fluid on her face. So ridiculous that can’t see what her original face was.
	Mia keeps hitting the ground with her feet, she wants to drag Jamie from outside and beats her.
	However, Jamie already went back to party.
	When Jamie goes back to the party. Lots of peoples are dancing on the dance floor.
	Looking around, Jamie finds Dan sitting at the corner, and she goes to him unconsciously
	Dan tapes the seat that next to him, indicating Jamie to sit down. Maybe because of the light, Dan looks so soft and gentle.
	Jamie has hesitated for few second before she sits down. She can’t help smiling when she thinks of Mia at the lady room back at the time.
	But the smile disappears when Jamie thinks of the death of her mother.
	Dan keeps observing her, but he still says nothing. No one knows is it because Dan doesn’t know what to say, or doesn’t feel the need to say.
	“Jamie.” Jack calls her when Jamie is thinking. Jamie takes a look at him, asks coldly,” What do you want?”
	Dan looks at Jack warning, which makes Jack scared. Jack asks carefully, “ Can I speak to you in private?” Jamie looks at Dan, seeing Dan is okay with this. Then she goes with Jack.
	Jamie silently sits across Jack in a room. Looking at Jack with no facial expression, just like watches at a stranger.
	Jack doesn’t care the rudeness of Jamie, says kindly,” All the families have missed you for the pass years, worrying about you. But seeing that you are doing great now, I’m very happy for you... By the way, How have you been through all these years?”
	“ Don’t need to bother about this.” Jamie answers.
	“Jamie, comes back and lives with us.” Jack still says kindly.
	“I’m fine living outside, why would I move back?” Jamie answers.
	“No matter how good you lives in outside, it can’t compare to home. And what if you get into dangerous situation?” Jack says nervously like he actually cares about Jamie.
	Jamie really wants to laugh out loud. She sees so many people that lie without preparing, but it’s the first time that she sees someone who lies to cover his bad acting.
	“Don’t you find yourself ridiculous by saying all these? When you threw me out the door five years ago, has you ever thought about me being death or living? Now you say these fancy words to me, don’t you know what is shame?” Jamie spits all the things she wants to say long time ago.
	Jack is a bit embarrassing, says to Jamie with slight anger, “this is the attitude you said to your father?”
	“Have I said anything wrong? Or you aren’t dare enough to admit what you have done? So now you turn angry out of shame?” Jamie turns around and leaves, leaving Jack with an angry face himself.
	Goes back to the party, Jamie can see many women around Dan from afar. Beside those women, there are also two men sit aside. Jamie finds them familiar, but can’t think of who they are exactly.
	When Jamie sees a scantily clad woman sticking herself to Dan, she wants to pull her away from Dan.
	
Chapter 37 I don’t need your concern 2
	Jamie walks through the dance floor slowly, and Dan sees Jamie.
	Seeing Jamie covers her stomach and bends down uncomfortably, Dan runs to Jamie hurriedly. And the woman who sticks herself to Dan is thrown out to the ground.
	Dan carries Jamie in his arms and leaves. Bruce Hill spots how viciously Mia looks at Jamie, there will be a good show in the future, Bruce thinks.
	Actually, Jamie just presents being uncountable, she didn’t know that Dan would take that so seriously.
	Outside the building, Dan carefully puts Jamie down in the passenger seat.
	“Put this on your belly first.” Dan grabs the heating pad, and places it on Jamie lower belly.
	It’s very uncomfortable to have the heating pad in summer time. Jamie frowns and casts it aside.
	“What happened?” Dan asks.
	Just when Jamie is going to tell Dan that she’s fine, she feels her period come.
	Jamie covers her belly hard, frowning because of the pain.
	Dan thinks that Jamie has eaten something wrong. Thus he gets into the driver seat in hurry, says, “I’ll take you to the hospital.”
	“Don’t. I’m fine.” Jamie’s face is so pale, but she still tries to stop Dan.
	Dan looks through her face carefully, smiling taunting, “Can you stop pretending you’re okay for a second?”
	Suddenly, Dan thinks of something. Then he starts the car, and leaves the Royal Hotel.
	Jamie covers her belly, thinking that she will need to ask Ian to make her some brown sugar water.
	Soon, Jamie is having too much pain to have any strength. It’s even difficult for her to open her eyes.
	The car stopped. Jamie can feel that Dan gets off the car. Later, Jamie hears that the door of her side is opened.
	“Get off.” Dan says. Jamie hardly opens her eyes, and gets off the car supporting on Dan.
	Walking towards the restroom of the supermarket, Dan hands something to Jamie. Jamie opens it and finds it is sanitary towel.
	Jamie feels embarrassing. Then she goes to the restroom lowering her head.
	Jamie finds Dan leans against the wall smoking when she comes out.
	She gets b a bit distracted. Jamie remembers that Dan rarely smokes, unless he is in bad mood.
	Then, what makes him felt bad right now? Jamie thinks.
	Seeing Jamie, Dan snuffs out the cigarette quickly, says to Jamie with a smile, “let’s go.”
	Jamie though Dan is going to send her home, so she follows Dan back into the car. Jamie finally relaxes her body after she used restroom, then she falls into sleep quickly.
	
Chapter 38 Waste of time 1
	When Jamie wakes up, she finds herself on the bed. Getting out of bed and looking outside from the window, she knows that here is Dan’s estate.
	Back to bed, Jamie finds a glass of brown sugar water on the bedside table. Then Jamie starts to drink it.
	Suddenly the door opens, Jamie looks up and sees Dan’s caring sight. Jamie puts down the glass cup, thinking that is she drunk Dan’s brown sugar water?
	Watching Dan coming closer, Jamie hands out the cup and says, “I didn’t mean to drink your brown sugar water. If you’re mad about this, you can deduct this from my wage.”
	It’s just a cup of sugar water, how much can I worth? Jamie thinks.
	Dan is confused by what Jamie said. Cos the brown sugar is prepared for her. And she thinks that...
	Dan hides his smiling from Jamie, then says, “The chef works in here is the best in the entire Leeds. You sure that you can pay for this?”
	Jamie really wants to swear, how come she is too poor to pay a glass of brown sugar water!
	Right on this moment, someone knocks the door, and Dan says, “Come in.” Then the housekeeper walks in with a glass of hot brown sugar water, looking at Jamie kindly, says, “Awake, Miss Moore. Have you feel better now? Drink this, you will feel better.”
	Jamie glances at Dan confusedly, then looks at the housekeeper and asks,” isn’t this for President William?” Jamie was going to call him Dan, but thinks of the relationship they’re in right now, she thinks President William will be better.
	The housekeeper finds it funny, but still explains to Jamie, “the young master asks me to prepare for you specially.”
	“You talks too much. You can leave now.” Dan sees Jamie smiling, ans feels a bit embarrassing
	The housekeeper doesn’t spoke anything else. Shaking his head with laughing, then leaves the room.
	Holding the glass, Jamie looks at Dan with embarrassment
	“What are you looking at? Drink it.” Dan says and goes into the closet.
	Drinking up the water, Jamie feels better. Then she puts away the glass and stretch.
	Jamie finds that Dan has already come out from the closet, and sits on the sofa.
	Turning against Jamie, Dan has a white towel around his neck, and a hand leaning on the sofa, looking at some place.
	Watching this, Jamie feels like that Dan is a great picture though he just sits there quietly.
	After a while, Jamie notices that is already 2 am in the early morning. She lies back to bed again, getting sleepy.
	“Thank you, brother William.” Knowing it’s Dan in front of her, all the thanks come out when Jamie is sleepy, including the words ‘brother William’.
	Dan is shocked, then happy. This is how Jamie called him when they were children.
	Staying for a long time, Dan kisses Jamie forehand and leaves.
	The second morning, Jamie awakes by the need of going to the bathroom.
	When Dan comes in and sees no one on the bed, frowning. Then he finds the bathroom is closed and he leaves.
Chapter 39 Waste of time 2
	When Jamie goes out from the bathroom, Dan just takes something to the room.
	Seeing Jamie stands with her bare feet, Dan is a bit unpleasant, “Have you slept enough? Go get change.”
	Jamie gets what Dan hands over, which are clothes and fresh up supply. “Thank you.” Jamie says, then turns back to the bathroom.
	Having a good bath in the tub, Jamie is ready to shower. Then she finds that the clothes are the newest design of the C&R, which makes her shocked and dull for a while.
	It’s already 8 o’ clock when Jamie gets out from the bathroom. Dan is watching TV, and doesn’t notice Jamie. Jamie is a bit anxious.
	Full her bonus of full attendance, Jamie walks to Dan and asks, “President William. Thank you for taking care of me. Can I go back home now?”
	It’s better that Jamie hasn’t asked that question. Dan frowns and angry when he hears.
	She can go to work directly, why she would need to go home first? Is she really having someone at her house?
	“Your condition is not well. Just stay here.” Dan puts down the remote control and walks out.
	Jamie stops Dan with anger, “ But I’m feeling much better. No need to waste time in here.”
	Waste of time? So staying in here is a waste of time? Dan turns coldly.
	“If you insist to leave, then you don’t need to come to work tomorrow.” Dan’s works is like a knife stabbing into Jamie’s heart.
	Jamie stops breathing, biting her lower lip hardly, asks carefully, “Can I call in sick?”
	Dan leaves directly. But Jamie relaxes when she hears Dan makes a sound for yes.
	After Dan left, Jamie closes the door in hurry. She looks through the room, and finally finds a back-up phone. She calls to home immediately.
	Inside the house, Ian hears the phone is ringing when he is going to leave for school.
	“Ian, it’s Mommy.” Jamie’s voice is low, but sounds good. Ian rests assured. It seems like that Daddy has taken good care of Mommy. “Mommy, you hasn’t come home for the whole night. Are you having relationship with someone behind my back?”
	Jamie shocks, and thinks that Ian is really mature for his age. Answers, “Of course not. You think too much, Ian. Haha.”
	I’m a fool if I believe you. Ian thinks.
	Talking to Ian for a while, then Jamie hangs up. Just when she tries to delete the record, someone is knocking the door. She puts the phone back to its original place in hurry, and sees the housekeeper walks in with a tray.
	“Are you feeling better today, Miss Moore? This is the brown sugar water, you can drink it after the breakfast.” The housekeeper puts down the tray in front of Jamie’s desk.
	Jamie smiles at her, “Thank you. Mrs Lin.”
	“Just call me Auntie Lin is fine.” The housekeeper says.
	The porridge is full of aroma, making Jamie become more hungry.
	Eating up the porridge and drinking up the water, Jamie asks carefully, “Auntie Lin, Can I go outside for a walk? To get some fresh air.”
	“Of course. Just treat yourself at home.” Auntie Line smiles bigger.
	Dan has never brought a woman home before, Jamie is the first one. So she must be special for Dan, naturally no restriction for her of course.
	The estate is big. Jamie walks to the gate after a while. When she puts her hands on the gate and tries to push, Jamie feels someone is coming behind. So she draws back hers hands and turns around.
Chapter 40 Catch 250 fish 1
	The man behind Jamie wears a pair of sunglasses, which covers 2/3 of his face. Good facial structure, gives out the sign that strangers don’t come closer.
	Jamie recognizes that he is Derek William, who worked as Dan’s bodyguard before. Jamie used to see him once or twice.
	Jamie gets exciting when she sees Derek, which gives a chill to Derek.
	“I’m boring, and I see there is a pond. Let’s have a competition, the one who lose must get punished.”
	Derek feels speechless. But he nods in the end.
	It’s just a fishing, she can’t push him into the pond as punishment, right?
	Two of them go to the pond, and gets ready to fish.
	The sunset shines upon the pond, making it looked orange. What a beautiful scene.
	However, Jamie is not in a good mood.
	Derek’s bucket is full of big fish, but hers only has one tiny finger long fish. Jamie turns more and more anxious. To turn around the situation, Jamie has come up with an idea.
	Jamie looks to the sky to estimate the time, and Dan should be home soon.
	Jamie sneaks around to Derek, who is focusing in fishing. Then she empties Derek’s bucket all at once. Clapping her hands acts like nothing happened. Jamie says, “President William.” When Dan is walking toward here.
	Jamie looks down and pretends to be submissive, which Derek can’t say anything about it.
	“I heard that you guys are having competition.” Dan puts his hands into his pockets, watching Jamie who just tricked Derek.
	“Yes, we are.” Jamie nods, smiling happily.
	“Then who win?” Dan asks with a smile.
	“You can see in person, president William. This is my bucket, and that one is Derek.” Jamie points to the buckets and says.
	“Miss Moore, I lost.” Before Dan speaks, Derek lowers his head and says to Jamie.
	“Then you just prepare for the punishment! Derek.” Jamie blinks her eyes and says.
	“Yes.” Derek has a bad feeling.
	Dan sinks into every smile of Jamie.
	He has to say, this Jamie in front of him is much more alive and attractive. Dan smiles natually, too..
	“Relax. I won’t give you a hard time. You just need to catch 250 fish.” Jamie smiles trickily
	Hearing the sarcasm number of 250, Derek falls apart mentally. Is that a recognition in disguise that he is a fool?
	“Derek, don’t come to meet me until you finish.” Dan ignores Derek, holding Jamie’s hands to the estate.
	Jamie is gloating and then finds her hand held by Dan. Smile fades away, all she has is scare.
	What have she done! She tricked the right hand of Dan. And Dan is not going to tolerate that. She has crossed the line. Jamie thinks.
	Jamie lowers her head remorsefully. It seems that Jamie becomes a little girl when she is with Dan.
	“Why are you lowering your head? Come here and eat.” Dan is in a good mood.
	All the gloomy atmosphere has been swept out. Peoples in the estate all feel warm.
	Jamie still stands on the same ground dully, until Auntie Lin pushes her a bit. Give an eye sight to Jamie, which indicates her to go over there and sits. Then, Jamie walks toward to the chair and sits.
	
Chapter 41 Catch 250 fish 2
	The dinning table is long. Dan sits on one hand, and Jamie sits next to his right. Two of them are close to each other, Jamie can even smile the mint fragrance from Dan, which makes her face blushed.
	Jamie secretly takes a look at Dan. Suddenly, Ian’s face shows up, the face that shares much similarity with Dan. What is Ian doing right now?
	Ian calls the number he found on the note when Jamie is not home these days. While he is calling, he keeps working on his note book.
	The second the phone is picked up, but gets hung up immediately. Ian looks at the darken screen with doubt.
	Ian turns to the note book, working for a long time but with tiny information. Ian puts together all the information and finds that the address is an old estate on the western suburbs. Rarely people knows about this place.
	It seems like this person works so hard to hide those people.
	Ian closes the note book and walks outside.
	“Child, this place is not safe. Why are you alone? Where is your mother?” The driver asks out of concern.
	“My mommy and Daddy will come here soon. I’m just a child. Can’t come here alone, it’s too dangerous. Luckily, my Daddy is friend of the police. With his protection, I’m not afraid.” Ian sits at the back seat and says calmly.
	His innocent words makes the driver laughed, and also let the driver believe him. And the driver doesn’t ask anymore.
	“Uncle, here’s the money.” Ian pays the driver with 100 even, then opens the door and gets off the car.
	Watching the taxi leaving, Ian finds his way to the old estate.
	Walks through the dense woods, Ian spots the old estate. No woods cover around the old estate, which makes it looked wild. But Ian still finds out the trace of someone is living here.
	Taping off the dust on his clothes, Ian walks to the old estate with his hands on the pockets.
	Squeaking, Ian pushes off the gate.
	Those who are hiding in the second floor can not believe what they have seen in the camera. How come a little child will be here!
	Ian looks around with innocence, which makes those in the second floor relaxed.
	But when they look to the screen again, they find that the child disappears!
	All of them are in shock. Then, they keep searching for the monitors of others places, but still fail to find the child.
	They all treat the situation seriously now, and in the stage of alert. They keep searching through the camera carefully. Before they confirm that Ian comes alone, they won’t risk to go outside.
Chapter 42 No need to thank me 1
	When peoples are focusing on one specific thing, they tend to miss other things. Like what happens now.
	“You guys are really silly. I have been waiting here for so long, and none of you notice me.” Ian speaks, which makes them turned back.
	Ian shakes left to right with one finger, smiling trickily, which is full of defiance.
	There are five persons standing in front of Ian, four males and one female. The room is dark, Ian can only see their face relying on the light from the screens. They are all in the age of twenty something, wearing casually.
	The only female, Night 7, walks to Ian. Looking Ian with smile and half squat, says, “Hi, Kid. Big sister has many candies here, why won’t you come and eat some with me?”
	Ian looks at her in despite, “Auntie, you smile so fake. It’s immoral to treat child with candy.”
	Night 7 feels speechless, counting her age in mind. She’s only 23 years old! Auntie?! This child has a bad mouth.
	Others also feel speechless about this.
	“You’re not cute at all.” Night 7 squeezes Ian’s cheek, and a sight of fierce shows in her eyes. And her hand moves to Ian’s neck slowly.
	Ian still smile peacefully, but he already knew what Night 7 is doing. “Auntie, don’t even think of killing me.”
	N stops with surprise. Such a small child but with great courage, others child would have wet their pants already. But this child is so calm, he doesn’t afraid at all.
	“What do you mean? Little bunny.” Night 7 doesn’t know his name, just calls him this out of his cuteness. Besides, Ian’s face is like a cute little bun.
	Ian blinks his eyes with shock, “Auntie, you know my name.” Sometime, Jamie calls Ian bunny if she wants kiss.
	Ian knows who they are, but he doesn’t scare. Mommy is the one to be blamed, she gave birth a bold son. Ian thinks.
	“I can call you Bunny, right? Your cheek is really soft.” Night 7 keeps squeezing his cheek. The more she looks at Ian, the more she likes him.
	“That’s what my mommy says. She loves to squeeze my cheek.” Ian gets away his cool face, looking so cute and adorable.
	“It seems like Bunny you love your mommy so much.” Night 7 has drown herself into Ian’s cuteness. The others are watching this speechlessly. What’s going on here? You should have finished that boy, why you guys are chatting now? They thinks.
	“Of course. My mommy is the most beautiful and kindest woman in the world.” Ian says with proud.
	Night 7 still wants to says something, but gets interrupted by Night.1. Night.1 says with warning, “Seven, stop.” Night 7 stops teasing Ian unpleasantly.
	Ian stops smiling and looks up to them, which makes him a bit upset. But for Ian’s height, he can only look up to these peoples.
	Ian bows gently, “First, I want to introduce myself. My name is Ian Moore, and my nickname is Bunny. And I come for the secret ring.”
	
Chapter 43 No need to thank me 2
	Five of them look intense now. Before they wouldn’t take Ian as a threat. But now, they thinks differently.
	How can a normal four years old child, has such great observation and boldness.
	Ian puts on the secret ring, which makes everyone on spot shocked.
	They all know what the secret ring means. They put their loyalty to the one with the secret ring. This is the faith for the Gilbert family.
	“Where did you get the ring?” Night.1 looks at Ian, and asks seriously.
	“This is given from my grandma to my mommy. And my grandma is the daughter of the Gilbert family, Adele Gilbert.”
	-
	Inside the dinning room of Dan’s estate-
	Jamie is busy eating, and only the sound of the tableware bumping with each other can be heard.
	Derek walks in with total wet, bows respectfully and says, “Young master, Miss Moore. I have fished 250 heads of fishes. Miss Moore can go to check them out.”
	Jamie looks up and smiles to Derek trickily, “That’s no need. I trust you. No need to thank me for this.”
	Derek stalemates on spot.
	Dan’s tightens up his hands with fork and knife. Squinting his eyes and looking at Jamie, an anger shows out. He is looking at his cheated wife. As if. Dan thinks.
	Ding...
	A clear noise is made from tableware. Jamie looks to Dan, but only sees Dan with his cold face.
	“I will make my departure now.” Derek knows something is wrong. I really gets tricked by this little devil Jamie. Derek thinks.
	Dan doesn’t speak a word, but he keeps looking at Jamie silently.
	Though Dan is angry, he doesn’t release the anger to Jamie. After all, there is nothing between Jamie and Derek. But that doesn’t mean that Dan is feeling better now.
	When the boss doesn’t feel good, others won’t be at ease.
	Jamie is too nervous to know where should she looks at or places her hands. She is afraid that the eyes’ contact with Dan will crush her into ashes. This growth up version of Ian is not cute at all, staring at people out of no reason. Jamie thinks.
	“You can leave tomorrow.” Dan speaks coldly.
	Jamie feels empty suddenly, and her smile vanishes.
	But with the thought of Ian, who is waiting her at home with his cute little face, Jamie gets cured immediately.
	“Thank you, president William.” Jamie nods submissively.
	“0524.” Dan suddenly says. Before Jamie figures out what Dan is saying, Dan explains, “it’s the password of the estate.”
	0524. This is Jamie’s birthday. But what Jamie doesn’t know, is why Dan will use her birthday as the password of the estate.
	The second day-
	Jamie keeps yawning on the way when she leaves Dan’s estate and goes back to her apartment. When Jamie is back to her place, Ian is still sleeping. So Jamie prepares the breakfast for Ian, and then goes to work.
	In front of the C&R Company, Jamie covers her mouth and yawns.
	Suddenly she finds that peoples around her are gossiping about her. Jamie looks over herself to see what’s wrong. Since her dress is in black today, so even though her period leaks out, no one should have noticed that. So, what exactly are those peoples looking at.
	Jamie goes back to the office. The moment she sits down, Emily makes a sneer from nose.
	
Chapter 44 Seduce the president 1
	Nana whispers to Jamie, “Jamie, I don’t know whether I should tell you or not. These two days...”
	Jamie doesn’t know that everyone in C&R knows that Dan has brought her to his personal estate. Though the fact has been twisted by Emily, but Jamie doesn’t angry about this, not at all. Just her pencil breaks into two parts for some reasons.
	From Nana’s view, Jamie doesn’t angry at all, cos she keeps smiling.
	“How dare you, Jamie. The estate of the president, someone like you, is not deserved to get inside. Those who don’t know the truth, they will think that you seduce the president shamelessly.” Emily putted down the mirror, then walks to Jamie and says.
	“Those who don’t know the truth, will believe that you just back from the toilet. Oh my god, that sour smell...” Jamie fans with her hand purposely, bouncing back Emily’s words.
	Emily embarrasses, because she just came back from the toilet. But all she can smells is the her Channel perfume.
	When Emily hears the suppressing laugh from Nana, then she knows that she is tricked, says resentfully, “What are you gloating at? You really think that the President interests in you? People like you, it’s not thing but like public transportation. Everyone can ride on it if they pay.”
	Jamie smiles coldly, and stands up suddenly, “It seems like you have plenty experiences already, right? People can ride on you only if they have money. How cheap you are! I am priceless. If you are so capable, you can ask the president to take you home; if you are so capable, you can go seducing the president. If you can’t, then you stop barking in front of me. I was scared by dog when I was child, I can’t bear to be scared again.”
	Jamie shrugs her shoulder innocently, but her smile becomes more slyly. Nana can’t hold herself anymore, she runs out of the office, and bursts into laughter.
	Emily is so angry that her face is twitching. And she raises her hand to slap Jamie.
	Jamie grabs Emily’s hand easily, and she slaps back to Emily.
	‘Pua’ The sound is clear and loud. Adam who is watching the show hides behind the computer, his shoulder twitching. Clearly he is laughing secretly.
	Jamie let go Emily’s hand, and Emily falls to the ground on her bottom. Emily hasn’t recovered from what just happened.
	Emily is crying for the pain on her face. Her brain is messing, and can’t think of anything about fighting back.
	“Emily, your make-up all messed up. Do you need my help?” Jamie says happily.
	“Jamie, you...you bitch!” Emily is so angry, but she doesn’t dare to fight back.
	It’s obvious that that slapping has scared Emily.
	“I won’t give someone hard time easily. Unless someone keeps messing up with me, then I won’t be kind anymore.” Jamie gets close to Emily and stares at her coldly, which makes Emily thrilled.
	Jamie goes back to her seat, and puts all her hair behind her shoulders. Then she starts working, like nothing has happened before.
	Adam looks up and finds that Emily has gone. Jamie wins the battle.
	Emily assigns many tasks to Jamie by using her position. Jamie has to work extra hours for that.
Chapter 45 Seduce the president 2
	Jamie wants to finish as early as she can, then she can go home to accompany Ian.
	Jamie is hungry, and her stomach has made noise to demonstrate that.
	Slightly taping her stomach, you can keep making noises, I won’t treat you with foods. Jamie thinks.
	After a long while, Jamie stops typing and stretches. She grabs her mug next to her computer and tries to drink it, but the milk inside was cold already. So She puts it back gloomily.
	Jamie can’t bear the hunger anymore. Just when she tries to order food delivery, the office’s door is opened with loudly noise. Then,Dan walks to Jamie coldly, and pulls Jamie out of her seat. Before Jamie finds out what is happening, she is in the elevator with Dan.
	Jamie doesn’t dare to ask what is this for. She just let Dan leads her. But Jamie feels crazy inside, cos it’s almost the working hour after the lunch time. Is he playing hooky with his own staff?
	To Jamie’s surprise, Dan takes her to the Royal Hotel. Jamie can smell how delicious the food is.
	No! Jamie, can you have higher aim? !
	Jamie squints her eyes. There is no better aim than getting a full stomach.
	All Jamie can think about is food, so she doesn’t notice how unpleasant Dan is.
	Dan snaps his fingers, then the waiter walks in. After he served everything on the table, the waiter leaves the room as quickly as he can. It seems that Dan gives him quite a scare.
	“Eat.” Dan pushes the dishes to Jamie.
	“President William. What’s going on?” Dan is too fierce, which made Jamie felt uncomfortable, so Jamie asks.
	Dan glances at Jamie lazily, doesn’t answer her question. But he starts to eat.
	Jamie finally understands what’s going on. She forgot that she has to eat with Dan everyday, so the boss came to catch her himself.
	With such a fierce boss, Jamie can’t bear for long.
	Jamie loses her appetite quickly. After all, you need a good mood to have appetite.
	“That’s all? You used to annoy me to eat with you.” Dan says with a bit teasing, which made Jamie angry.
	“You must be forgetting something, president William. You are the one needs me to eat with you. Is it ridiculous for what you just said?” Jamie talks back consciously.
	Dan smiles, then stands up suddenly. Strangling Jamie’s neck with aggressive, “I’m afraid that you also forgot something. It only takes me few second to strangle you to die.”
	Jamie knows that if Dan wants to strangle her to die, then there is no way she can escape from this. Jamie shouldn’t have provoked him, but it seems like that she just did.
	Jamie is a bit afraid. But her eyes still looks strong and stubborn. Though Jamie is scared, she won’t show it, especially not in front of him.
	Dan clenches his lips, which seems like that he is enduring something hardly. Then, he slowly gets closer to Jamie’s ear, and slightly bites that cute little earlobe of Jamie, “It has been five years already. When do you return me for what you owe me already?”
	Teasing! This is teasing!
	Jamie trembles a bit. Out of nowhere, she thinks of the night when she had sex with Dan. She didn’t realize that she still remembers that night clearly, even after five years.
	
Chapter 46 I don’t owe you anything 1
	Jamie, Jamie. You’re really helpless. Jamie thinks.
	“I don’t owe you anything.” Jamie pushes away Dan, and her face is all reddish.
	Dan takes a few steps back and sits back to the chair. Looking at Jamie, he says, “Jamie, now you’re back. Then you better keep this in mind. You belonged to me five years ago, and you still are. And your name will appear next to mine eventually. If you still want to run away, then you can try. I will catch you back no matter how far you run.”
	Dan speaks slowly, which shows how serious he is right now.
	What Dan said has reminded Jamie of the night five years ago.
	Dan keeps in good shape. Though he is sitting, Jamie can still his great figure underneath the clothes. It’s no hard to tell that Dan works out a lot. Looking at Dan, Jamie can’t think straight right now.
	“Dan William. Is that mean you want to marry me?” Jamie blurts.
	The whole room turns into silence, which made Jamie realized what she has said.
	Oh My God!
	What did she just say?!
	“Is that mean you want to marry me?”
	If she said to another person, she will says strongly, “Is there anyone beside me dare to marry you? I’m your only option.” But the person now is Dan... Jamie thinks.
	Jamie feels like she can’t breathe anymore.
	Dan keeps taping the desk rhythmically, which makes Jamie felt very nervous.
	Jamie keeps watching at Dan, she doesn’t dare to move a bit. If he tries to struggle me again, I will run for good. Jamie thinks.
	“Marry you?” Dan says with a sneer, and looks at Jamie coldly.
	Jamie wants to look at somewhere else, but she fails to do so. The coldness in Dan’s eyes is like knife piercing through her heart. So cold that makes Jamie felt disappointed.
	Jamie, he doesn’t want to marry you at all, and you are sad about it, right? Jamie thinks.
	She looks down slowly, and sits still on the chair without any energy.
	“Is there any option for you beside marry me?” Dan smiles. It seems like Jamie doesn’t refuse the idea of marrying him.
	Jamie looks up with surprise, and she realizes that she is tricked by Dan.
	“You are too confident about yourself.” Jamie says.
	Ignoring the slightly happiness in her heart, Jamie feels desperate.
	How can she marry to Dan? Because of him, Ian nearly failed to come to the world.
	If he knows Ian’s existence the consequence will be horrible...
	“You didn’t look through the contract, right.” Dan plays his phone and lets Jamie to sit.
	Contract? Jamie blanks for a second. Is he mean the one that signed when she works for the C&R? Jamie thinks.
	“Is there any problems?” Jamie sits down and grabs the juice. She is quiet thirsty, so she keeps drinking.
	“You didn’t know the seventh regulation of the contract? Do you still remember the amount of the penalty?” Dan says in low voice, but it’s like a huge stone crushed on Jamie’s heart.
	The seventh regulation of the contract!
	Luckily Jamie has a good memory, so she rethinks of it quickly. It says, Any staff quits without the permission of management group, needs to pay one million pound as the penalty.
	Oh My God!
	Jamie’s mouth keeps twitching. She didn’t feel anything wrong with the regulation that time, but until now, she knows that she is set up by Dan.
	Jamie really wants to release her anger to Dan. But she has to tolerant it.
	On the weekend, Jamie and Ian goes shopping.
	After a while, Jamie needs to use the toilet, she wants to take Ian inside with her. But Ian refuses, and insists to wait outside.
	Jamie stops forcing him. After all, Jamie knows that Ian won’t be gone off with strangers. But, she, on the other hand... Anyway, Jamie doesn’t worry at all.
Chapter 47 I don’t owe you anything 2
	Ian walks to the Cake shop when he sees Jamie goes inside the toilet.
	The second Jamie has gone inside the toilet, her cell phone rings, which scares her a bit.
	“Hello?” Jamie answers the phone.
	“Go to the Cake Shop you were just passing by in 10 minutes.” Dan says in his commanding tone.
	Jamie doesn’t care about what Dan said. She hangs up after she said goodbye to Dan.
	Dan can’t believe that. This little woman hung up on him!
	Dan has the familiar feeling again, the sense of frustration.
	However, comparing with the submissive action, Dan prefers the way Jamie acts right now.
	No pretending in front of him. And this is Jamie, the only Jamie.
	Ian walks inside the Cake Shop and orders. After he finishes the order, Ian sits across to Dan, who is playing his phone at the moment. Lifting up his cap, Ian stares at that nearly identical face curiously.
	Getting more and more exciting, this is the first time that Ian sees his father. If it’s possible, he really wants to know how is that feel by held in Daddy’s arms.
	Dan notices someone is sitting across him, and he looks up unpleasantly. When he sees the mini version of him, he surprises.
	“You..you are?” staring at Ian’s face, Dan stutters.
	If he doesn’t know himself well, he will believe that it’s his own son sitting across him.
	Wait, Jamie was pregnant when she left five years ago!!
	“How old are you? Child.” Dan is expecting that this is his son.
	“Five or six years old.” Ian picks a piece of cake and eats, pretending to think.
	He can’t tell the truth, what if Daddy suspects Mommy. Ian thinks.
	The age doesn’t match. Jamie left five years ago.
	However, Dan doesn’t give up. After all, this face is so identical with his. It’s basically the mini version of Dan. How are the odds of this? And also let him come across this?
	“Then what’s your mother’s name?” Dan says softly and kindly. So soft that his voice sounds a bit stiff. Maybe because he never meet child this small before.
	Deep down his heart, Dan keeps exciting and expecting.
	Ian makes up a random name. And Dan loses his hope.
	“How about your father?” Dan keeps asking.
	“I don’t have father. My mommy said that I came out from a watermelon.” Ian answers innocently.
	Child from single family. Though he looks like me, he is not... He is not my son. Dan thinks.
	“Hey, handsome guy, do you feel like I’m your son because we look so similar.” Ian asks naughtily. If Jamie finds out that he calls his own father as handsome guy, she will beat Ian’s ass.
	Dan is a bit surprised for the child sitting in front of him. He’s only five or six years old, but he already know how to observe and pay attention to others’ action and words?
	“Now you’re thinking. Whose child is it, right? So clever.” Ian takes a bit of the dessert. He is so cute that people who sees him will want to cuddle him.
	It turns out that mind’s connection really exists between father and son. Ian thinks.
	Dan feels bad. It’s not good to be seen through by someone else, especially not by a child.
	Takes a zip of the lemon juice, the sweet and sour taste makes Dan frowned.
	The lemon juice is for Jamie. Only she likes the taste that sweetness and sourness mixes together. Dan thinks.
Chapter 48 Call me Bunny
	“Handsome, you will have wrinkles if you frown too much.” Ian tells Dan.
	Is daddy in a bad mood? He looks ugly when he frowns, like an old witch. Ian says in his mind.
	“This is manliness. Little kid like you won’t understand.” Dan says teasingly with a smile. He feels like his mood has turned better already.
	“I’m not little kid. I have a name.” Ian says with a bit unpleasantness.
	“What is your name?” Dan asks with interest.
	“You can call me bunny.” Ian holds up his chin proudly. He really likes his nickname, because it is named by mommy.
	Dan looks at Ian’s soft little face, which looks like a little bun.
	How is that feels like...
	Out of reason, Dan reaches out his finger and pokes Ian’s face, which surprises Ian a lot.
	Soft and bouncy, an unknown feeling appears out of no where, which also drowns over Dan.
	If this is my child, i will give him all my love and the best thing in the world. Dan thinks.
	This is the first time that Dan wants to have his own child with Jamie.
	“Handsome, are you taking advantage from me?” Ian suppresses his eager that he wants to rush inside Dan’s arms and calls him daddy. Ian keeps blinking his eyes and smiling, which makes him looked like Dan even more.
	Dan stops and withdraw his finger, “you think too much. I don’t interest in child.”
	“Is that mean you actually interest in man?” Ian smile trickily.
	“It’s better to interest in man than you.” Dan calmly talks back. Though his words will easily make misunderstanding, Dan doesn’t care at all.
	Round one, Dan wins.
	Ian praises his daddy in mind. Daddy is so doughty, he and Mommy is indeed the perfect match.
	“Though I’m still small now, i will grow up as a big handsome boy. Don’t underestimate me.” Ian says seriously.
	His daddy is so handsome, how can his son not be like this.
	“It’s possible that you grow up in the way that is a total departure from your youth cuteness.” Dan can’t help to tease Ian.
	Ian nods his head, “I see. So you was ugly in your childhood. But you has grown up in the way that is a total departure from your childhood, and that’s why you’re handsome now.”
	Dan’s mouth keeps twitching. He doesn’t need to grow up in departure to be handsome.
	Wait... Did he say childhood?
	Dan is in a daze. As if the time has travelled back, this boy in front of him looks exactly the same with him in childhood.
	Ian doesn’t know what Dan is thinking. Looking outside from the window, Ian sees that Jamie is looking for him hurriedly.
	“Handsome, I need to go home now. See you next time.” Ian waves to say goodbye and leaves the Cake Shop quickly.
	Dan watches the little figure running out from his sight, feeling disappointed.
	“Mommy!” Ian jumps out behind Jamie, and tapes her hand.
	Jamie nearly falls on the ground for being scared. After she finds her balance again, she gives a slight slap on Ian’s bottom, “where have you been? How dare you to keep your Mommy waiting.”
	Ian cooperates by an ow and rubs his little bottom. Though it doesn’t in pain, it gets a bit numb, “I just goes to buy the dessert you like.”
	Ian takes out the dessert he prepared already, with a cute smile that his teeth are shown.
	Jamie’s eyes are sparkling, she gets the dessert and kisses Ian on his cheek,” you are the best.”
	Ian smiles. Mommy is such a foodie, she can be easily fooled as long as there is food.
	After having a dinner at restaurant, Jamie and Ian goes back home.
	“Bunny, go and prepare some fruit. We’re going to watch a movie tonight.” Jamie sits on the sofa, and tells Ian to do things.
	“Jamie, that guy is calling!Jamie,that guy is calling!Jamie,why don’t you pick up the phone!”
	The horrible rings tone scares Jamie, and the remote control nearly falls to the ground.
	Jamie picks up and places the phone near her ear. Thinking that when did Ian change her ring tone, Jamie doesn’t see that it’s Dan’s number on the screen.
	“Hello, who is it?” Jamie asks.
	“Meet me on the old place in half an hour. Pass 30 minutes, bonus decreases by half.”
	Then hangs up.
	Jamie is in a daze. Is this calling from Dan? Looking through the dial record, it was Dan calling.
	Jamie takes a look at the clock. It’s already 7pm.
	Should I go or not? Jamie keeps thinking.
	Wait! Bonus?!
	“Bunny!Mommy has something to do. You stay at home and shower first.” Jamie changes shoes and leaves quickly.
	Ian leans against the wall, and takes a bit of the watermelon, smiling trickily. Judging form the speed, it must be Mommy’s boss, his Daddy. Ian thinks.
	For the bonus, Jamie makes it to the old place in short time.
	It’s not the food street, but the harbor park in Leeds.
	Jamie hasn’t been here for many years. But the park doesn’t change much.
	It should be crowed with peoples at night. But Jamie sees no on all the way she walks in.
	Jamie looks around for a long time, but she doesn’t see Dan.
	Knock-
	A clear sound stops Jamie. Jamie squints her eyes and follows the sound, and she finds a vague figure with familiar body shape, lying on the grass.
	That isn’t the big boss, right? Jamie thinks.
	Walks close to that man, Jamie looks at him carefully. It’s Dan.
	Dan is lying on the grass, with many empty bottles scaring around.
	“Dan? Are you okay?” Jamie pats his face slightly. It’s clearly that Dan is drunk, because Jamie can feel the hotness of his face.
	Dan opens his eyes hardly, and reaches out his hands to touch Jamie ’s face, when he knows it’s Jamie with him. Dan murmurs, “little Jamie.”
	Jamie is shocked. What did he just call her? Little Jamie?
	“Why you forget about me?” Dan touches Jamie’s face gentle,and looks at her dimly.
	Jamie feels like her heart is being stabbed, hurting hardly. She bites her lower lips, and avoids eyes’ contact with Dan, “You’re drunk. I will send you home.”
	Jamie tries to pull Dan up by dragging his hands. But Dan pulls Jamie down with sudden force.
	Before Jamie realizes what happened, Dan is on top of her and kisses her.
	Jamie’s brain becomes blank immediately.
	Though Dan is drunk, his kiss is so gentle that makes Jamie drown herself into it.
	
Chapter 49 How she dares to bite him
	Suddenly, she reminds of something and then she bites him hardly on the lip. Then she pushes him away and sits on the grass with hard breath.
	Dan William lies motionless on the ground. No matter how hard Jamie Moore pushes, he has no action.
	Jamie Moore is startled. She reaches out to probe his nose, and she relieves when she finds he is still alive.
	She stands up and looks around and then says, "Derek William, I know that you're here."
	Derek William walks out from the darkness. He still dresses in black as before, and the cold breath around him made people dare not approach, "Miss Jamie."
	"Take your young master back. Remember, don't say that I've been here tonight." Jamie Moore points at the Dan William who lies on the ground as if he is asleep.
	Take him back? Derek William looks at Dan William who lies on the ground sympathetically, and finally he nods.
	The next morning-
	In the manor, as soon as Dan William sits up from bed with his hand on the temple, Cindy Swift opens the door and walks in.
	"Master, are you wake up? It's better to have a sobering tea." Cindy Swift puts the tea aside and says respectfully.
	"You could put it here."
	"Okay." Cindy Swift bows her head and goes out with the tray.
	After washing, Dan William walks out in his bathrobe and sits on the sofa. His long fingers rub the bitten part of his lower lip. His face was not good.
	"Derek William." He calls.
	Derek William walks out from the dark and nods respectfully, "Young master."
	"Where did I go last night?"
	Who bites him last night? He remembers that he stays at the Coastal Park last night. Does he go to the entertainment club later?
	Does he even find someone else?
	"Young master, you went to the Coastal Park last night. Then you were drunk and you stayed with Miss Jamie." Derek William says truthfully.
	He has no secret in front of Dan William, so he ignores Jamie Moore’s words directly.
	Stayed with Jamie Moore?
	Suddenly, Dan William reminds that he calls Jamie Moore last night, so it seems that last night is not an illusion.
	"What did you see?" Dan William' feel a little bit relaxed.
	Derek William tells all the truth he sees, but suddenly he finds that Dan William's face becomes dark again, so he quickly shuts up.
	Dan William rubs the wound on his lip carefully, but then he smiles. Does this girl become so brave? How she dares to bite him?
	Does she even Let Derek William bring him back?
	It’s good. It’s really good!
	In front of the CR building, a beautiful figure comes down from a Rolls Royce. That person is Mia Moore.
	Mia Moore walks into Cr, but she doesn’t enter the elevator directly. Instead, she runs to the front desk. When she learns that Jamie Moore is on the 12th floor of the company, she turns around and enters the elevator.
	In the office, Nana Banks asks for a week's leave for illness. Adam lee also asks a week’s leave for taking care of Nana Banks at her home. Emily Lin also wanders around Shawn Hall these days and she seldom comes back to the office.
	At the most of the time, there is only Jamie Moore in the big office.
	At this time, Jamie Moore is listening to the song with headphones. She plays the pencil with his fingers, and she is very leisure and comfortable.
	When Mia Moore walks into the door, she immediately sees Jamie Moore who is listening the song. She presses her lips, and then walks to Jamie Moore with high-heeled shoes.
	Crack.
	Mia Moore slaps the documents on the table heavily. The sound is loud.Jamie Moore looks up and she is shocked when she finds the person in front of her is Mia Moore.
	"What are you doing here?" Jamie Moore takes the earphone off and puts it back in the drawer, and she arranges the documents by the way.
	"Don’t you know what I am doing here?" Mia Moore looks downs and sneers at Jamie Moore with her hand around her arms.
	"You are so funny. First, you are not my boss. Second, you are not my mother. How should I know what you are going to do?" Jamie Moore glances at her, and says in a slow speed.
	Mia Moore sneers. No matter how long it takes, she never wins Jamie Moore when she quarrels with her.
	"How could you compare your mom with me? Who are you? You are just fake daughter of the Family Moore. Do you think you can look as good as before?"
	"Oh? Aren't you something? " Jamie Moore smiles and she is in a good mood.
	"Of course, I’m sure that I’m something!” Mia Moore retorts at once.
	"It turns out that Miss Mia is something. Tut tut. It's really hot news." Jamie Moore says the two words “Miss Mia” hardly.
	If Mia Moore wants to quarrel with Jamie Moore, Mia Moore will be loser at any time.
	Only then does Mia Moore realize that she has been trapped by Jamie Moore’s words, and then her face becomes blue and white.
	"You are the thing!" Mia Moore feels disgust when she sees Jamie Moore’s face, thus she waves her hands toward Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore easily clasps her wrist and smiles, "you've known that you can't get good from me, and you still come to find trouble with me. Are there something wrong with your brain? Is the Moore family so poor that they don't even have the money to treat you? "
	"You! Don't forget that your last name is Moore! "
	Mia Moore jumps from Jamie Moore, and then she kicks the stomach of Jamie Moore hardly.
	Jamie Moore dodges, but her thigh is still kicked by Mia Moore.
	Jamie Moore feels speechless. Why does women like to use force to solve problems now?
	Emily Lin does such, and so does Mia Moore.
	In the end, the fight ends with Mia Moore going to Dan William's office angrily with a bad face.
	Jamie Moore claps her hands and then goes to the bathroom to wash her hands, while Mia Moore pushes the door of Dan William's office straightly and shouts, "Brother Dan!"
	Dan William frowns, and he answers coldly .
	Mia Moore suddenly feels a little better. She does what Jamie Moore did before, and walks to Dan William to show her grievance and says, "Brother Dan, I’m beaten by your staff just now."
	"Oh? It seems that my staff does not beat you hard since you still could run." Dan William does not look up and he still reviews the document on the table.
	"Brother Dan, please look at my face. It has turned red. How can I see others in the future?" Mia Moore raises her voice and she even knocks at the desk, and she points at her red swollen face.
	She deliberately doesn’t tell Dan William who beats her, and she just want to let Dan William quit Jamie Moore in a muddle. Compared with dealing with Jamie Moore, this way is more easy.
	Dan William puts down his pen and raises his head lazily. When he sees Mia Moore's swollen and ugly face, he sneers, "How could my staff beat you when she sees your face. Isn’t she afraid that she will leave something bad in her mind."
	Mia Moore's face turns red suddenly.
	Dan William’s words just like some knives stabs hardly on Mia Moore’s heart, and the blood drips to the ground.
	"Miss Mia, don't forget to pay for the medicine if my employee is injured." Dan William lowers his head and continues to read the documents.
	Dan William’s words make Mia Moore feel more painful. Even she is beaten by Jamie Moore, she never has such feeling.
	"Do you know who hit me?"
	Dan William does not answer her.
	Mia Moore says with his gnashing teeth, “Jamie Moore!”
	Suddenly, Dan William raises his head and frowns and then he asks, "You say that it's Jamie Moore who hit you?"
	Mia Moore nods her head hardly. Seeing that the eyesight of Dan William fall on her face, she feels a little happy.
	However, Dan William just sneers. He leans on the soft cushion, and says with a smile around the corner of his mouth, "Mia Moore, don't you think it's ridiculous that you complain in front of me when you are beat by Jamie Moore.”
	
Chapter 50 Jamie Moore is my taboo
	Mia Moore is shocked.
	"I allow you to go in and out of Cr freely, and allow the Family Moore to do whatever they want in their country, but..." Dan William pauses, and then he says with cold voice, "Jamie Moore is my taboo. Don't say that you forget it."
	"In my eyes, Jamie Moore is always right. Even though she is wrong, she is right."
	Mia Moore doesn't know how she get out of the CR building by Secretary Sam. She wants to run in and ask questions, but she is stopped by the guard at the door.
	Then Secretary Sam suddenly turns around and he says with a smile, "I'm sorry, Miss Moore, you're on the CR blacklist. You can't enter the CR building for half a step in the future."
	Mia Moore opens her eyes in horror, and now she begins to regret that she had found trouble with Jamie Moore in the place of Dan William?
	Jamie Moore doesn’t know all of this. She is applying the ointment at the moment.
	After applying the ointment on the neck, she wants to apply the ointment on her leg, and at this moment, the door of the office is opened again.
	Jamie Moore is speechless. How could Mia Moore come back again?
	When she sees the man clearly, her movements stopped abruptly.
	Dan William puts his hands in his trouser pockets. Seeing that she is applying the ointment, he frowns and says, "Are you hurt?"
	Hearing his words, Jamie Moore presses her lips.
	"Give it to me." Dan William sits down opposite her. He takes the ointment and cotton swab in her hand, and he is prepared to apply the medicine for her.
	Jamie Moore’s delicate face blushes. Fortunately, Dan William looks down and he could not see anything.
	"You are as weak as before." Dan William presses hard on Jamie Moore’s bruised wound as he says.
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore also cries.
	Oh, my god. Are there any resentment and hatred between them. Does he murder her?
	"She also does not get anything good from me."
	Jamie Moore feels so painful that she almost wants to catch Dan William’s black hair.
	Dan William snorts. He suddenly feels that the blame- put Mia Moore on the CR blacklist is too light.
	As for the Family Moore, since Jamie Moore doesn't care anymore, he doesn't have to be polite.
	"Ah! Dan William, are you going to kill me? " Jamie Moore feels very painful. She has lost her usual calm and indifferent image, and now she is a bit of loveliness.
	Jamie Moore is so painful that she could not bear anymore. She strangles the neck of Dan William, and she does not want to give up. Beside, she even grabs his hair by the way.
	It feels good.
	Dan William stops and he looks at the lovely look of Jamie Moore, then his eyes gradually become deep and bright.
	Although his strength is not strong, the position of pressing is absolutely the most painful.
	The aim is to make her remember that no matter how miserable the other side is, she can't let the other side take any advantage.
	Only when she remembers the pain, she will not touch later.
	After venting, Jamie Moore realizes that what she had done. She quick stands up and looks at Dan William.
	Bonus! She reads it in her heart.
	Then she raises a familiar smirk, "Thank you for caring about you subordinates and applying the ointment for me, Mr. Dan. I won't bother Mr. Dan later."
	Care for subordinates? Don't bother him?
	Dan William suddenly frowns. When he sees Secretary Sam who is ready to walk into the door, he face is cold.
	Does she want to get rid of him? This is impossible!
	Dan William smiles meaningfully. He stands up and clean his clothes, and then he walks to Jamie Moore with a smile. He touches Jamie Moore’s face gently and then says, "Honey, I will go first, don't miss me too much."
	Looking at Jamie Moore, who is a little stiff, the eyesight of Secretary Sam is full of gossip.
	It suddenly occurred to her that the interview of designers is always conducted by Shawn Hall, but this time, the president does it by himself. It seems that they has an unusual relationship.
	What's more, she has been a general secretary for so long time, and she has never seen the president talk to anyone so indulgently. Dan William looks at Jamie Moore with satisfaction. Then he puts puts his hands in his pockets and walks out of the office handsomely and arrogantly.
	Secretary Sam follows him quickly. She even looks at Jamie Moore carefully before leaving.
	Then Jamie Moore realizes that Dan William is making a play, and his purpose is obvious!
	...
	At about eight o'clock in the evening, Jamie Moore comes back to the apartment. She walks into the room lightly, and she tries not to make a sound, and walks into the room lightly.
	“Crack”. The light in the living room suddenly turns on. Jamie Moore turns back quickly. She is relieved when she sees the person is Ian Moore.
	"Boy, don't you want to frighten your mommy to death by staying up so late?"
	Jamie Moore walks to Ian Moore and grabs Ian Moore’s face.
	Ian Moore takes Jamie Moore’s hand away and looks at her in disgust, "Mommy, your courage is so small. You are scared by me in such a way. Or what's wrong with mommy today? You dare not let me know."
	Ian Moore looks at Jamie Moore carefully. When he sees bruises on Jamie Moore’s neck and calf, his eyes flash sharply.
	Who did this?
	"Go, what can Mommy do? You little aunt find trouble with me."
	Ian Moore thinks with his head askew, and then he reminds that it's Mia Moore!
	It's the woman who bullies his mother at the party last time. At that time, he sprays a layer of colorful super glue on her face.
	"Mommy is ready to take a bath, you should go to bed early." Jamie Moore kneads Ian Moore’s soft hair and then she steps into the bathroom.
	Ian Moore enters his room, and locks the door, then he takes out his laptop.
	After a long time, he slowly closes the computer, and he smiles badly.
	The next day, almost all the entertainment sections in C country are occupied by Mia Moore.
	Even if you look at them carelessly, you can see several big characters written in bold on them.
	"Miss Mia wanders around the party club, and it seems that she has a relationship with someone?"
	There are also some super clear photos attached below. With the no code, you can recognize that Mia Moore is the woman on the new.
	Mia Moore is famous in country C because of Dan William.
	In the past five years, no matter where she goes, she has always been the focus of attention. She can even be seen at some banquet where Dan William appears.
	However, the whole country C also knows that Dan William has always loved a woman and he will only marry her.
	It is said that Dan William treats Mia Moore differently because she is similar to that woman.
	But today, it's reveals that Miss Mia wanders in the party club?
	It is a heavy blow for both Mia Moore and the Family Moore.
	In a short time, the stock of the Family Moore fall to stop directly. Jack Moore almost fails to get his breath.
	"Mr. Dan usually treats you very well. You hurry up to beg him. If you can't make sure of it, you won't come back! " In the office, Jack Moore is very angry and he almost take something to hit Mia Moore.
	Mia Moore huddles in Celina Swift's arms. Her face is full of tears, and she looks sad and pitiful.
	It’s the first for her to go to such place. How could she catch by the the media? And Dan William even doesn’t press the news for her!
	Mia Moore feels cold when she reminds that she she has been pulled into blacklist by Dan William.
	
Chapter 51 You have such a good daughter
	Is he avenging her? Does he want her loss all of the reputation?
	"Mia, you'd better go to find Mr. Dan as soon as possible. Now only he can help us." Celina Swift is very angry, "Mia, how can you go to such a place?"
	"Mom, can I not go?" Mia Moore is afraid when she thinks the attitude of Dan William yesterday.
	The man could not help her. He only loves Jamie Moore.
	"Unfilial daughter!" Jack Moore is so angry that he picks up the pen on the desk and smashes it toward Mia Moore.
	"Oh, what are you doing? This is our own daughter! " Celina Swift quickly blocks the flying pen and glares at Jack Moore.
	"You have such a good daughter! Now she grows up, and she even do such things. If we don't remedy it as soon as possible, the Family Moore will be destroyed in her hands sooner or later!"
	Celina Swift is afraid and then she says, "Is thing so serious?"
	"Can’t you watch the thing by yourself? I tell you the truth. It won't be long before we have to sleep on the big road if things continue in such a state! " A figure suddenly flashes in Jack Moore’s mind. His eyes become bright, and it seems that he reminds of something.
	"Mia, you should ask for help from Dan William." Celina Swift turns around and begins to persuade Mia Moore.
	Mia Moore is so afraid. Now she even can’t enter the Cr building. How could she ask for help from Dan William?
	"No, I have found the solution." Jack Moore calms down suddenly and then he raises his hand to make a phone call.
	Celina Swift and Mia Moore all looks up and it seems that they have found the Savior.
	Jamie Moore is washing her face in the bathroom. Unexpectedly, she receives a phone call from Jack Moore. She frowns softly: how can he have her own number?
	As soon as Jamie Moore answers the phone, she hears that Jack Moore request her to let Dan William to hold down the new about Mia Moore. Jack Moore says in a threaten and beg way, which make Jamie Moore feel very angry.
	"What's the matter with me? Did I eat yours or use yours? " Jamie Moore sneers and the she hangs up the phone. Suddenly, she finds this feeling of venting seems very good.
	When Jamie Moore back to the office, she searches the news immediately. She easily sees the new of Mia Moore.
	"Tut tut Tut, she's really unlucky. She may make trouble with someone else. She's so miserable."
	Jamie Moore slides the mouse and reads the following lines of small words. She laughs.
	You deserve to be punished since you make trouble with me.
	Ian Moore, who is in class, sneezes suddenly. he rubs his nose gently, which almost break other girls’ heart.
	Dongdongdong. There is a knock at the door.
	Jamie Moore is excited. It's not easy. There's a knock at the door at last.
	Jamie Moore press the shortcut key to return to the desktop and then she looks at the door and says "please come in".
	The man who comes in is Secretary Sam. She smiles at Jamie Moore with a funny look.
	"Jamie Moore, the president asked you to come to his office."
	Dan William?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she smiles, "OK."
	This is the first time that Jamie Moore has stepped into the office of Dan William this week.
	Recently, she has no design draft to show Dan William, so there are not many opportunities for them to meet each other.
	"Mr. Dan." Secretary Sam calls respectfully.
	"A cup of coffee, and a cup of juice." Dan William brushes his name on the document and then gives orders.
	Secretary Sam is shocked, juice? Do I have to buy it now?
	"Yes."
	"Have you heard about Mia Moore?" Dan William puts down his pen. He asks lazily with his elbows on the table and hands folded under chin.
	"I have heard that." Jamie Moore looks at him doubtfully. Is it him?
	"If it is me, she would have been worse off."
	Dan William has yet to find out who did it, but this man should have a great influence. Otherwise, how can he avoid all people to make such a sensational news overnight?
	Jamie Moore nods, and she thinks about how to help the Family Moore in her heart.
	If the Family Moore disappears, where can she find the secret ring?
	"I can help the Family Moore, but you have to promise me a condition." Dan William says with shinning in his eyes.
	"Conditions?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. As long as she talks about the condition with him, she will loss every time.
	It's not a law. It's her experience. She has been cheat for many times.
	Dan William leans back in his chair and says, "If you live in the manor for one time every week, I'll put down this matter."
	"Mr. Dan, I have rented an apartment."
	The implication is that I have a place to live.
	If Wendy hears this, I'm sure she'll beat me to death. Don’t I know the meaning of this words!
	Dan William's face is still calm, but he feels depress in his heart. How can this woman's EQ be so low?
	"You just have to say the answer."
	"I agree!"
	Dan William shows a smile of success.
	In this way, they will meet each other more. He will not afraid that she will run away.
	Although Jamie Moore agrees, she is still worried about what to do with Ian Moore when she is not at home.
	Dan William continue to smile. In addition to being stern to her at the beginning, or murderous to her, in fact, at the most of the time, he is always smiles at her.
	Bah, it's a gentle smile that say something bad to her.
	"Mr. Dan, can I ask you a question?" Jamie Moore asks hesitantly.
	Dan William’s eyes become dark, and he nods.
	"What do you do if your woman gives birth to your child outside?" Jamie Moore asks nervously.
	She expects his answer and at the same time she is afraid.
	Dan William does not expect that Jamie Moore will ask such things five years later.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore and says, "How, do you want to give me a baby?"
	He only has one woman , that is Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore naturally understands what he meant, and her face turns red suddenly.
	"Dan William, do you have face?" Jamie Moore runs out after finishing her words.
	Looking at Jamie Moore’s back, Dan William smiles. He reminds the baby he meets in the cake shop that day. His heart is full of expectation.
	Will Jamie Moore and his children be so lovely in the future.
	But Jamie Moore does not know.
	Jamie Moore's re-entry into the CEO's office has once again sweeps through the female biology of CR.
	If it isn't for the fact that there is a director on Jamie Moore's floor, everyone would have to break their heads to see who Jamie Moore is.
	"Jamie, have you see the news? Mia Moore is in the headlines! " Wendy calls Jamie Moore.
	Wendy always speaks in a loud way, which make Jamie Moore feel a little overwhelmed.
	"Can't you calm down, Wendy." Jamie Moore rubs his aching ears and feels speechless.
	Wendy shows no care about this.
	"By the way, why haven't you been in touch with me for so long? Are you fall in love with someone?" Jamie jokes.
	"Who tells you that? There is no man in the world that can make me willingly give birth to a monkey for him. " Wendy says with all her heart.
	But Jamie Moore knows that there is a man in Wendy's heart, but the man does not know that Wendy likes him.
	A careless girl likes a man who is silent and indifferent like a stone. Jamie feels the greatness of love.
	As a good friend, Jamie Moore must do something.
	After chatting for a while, they hang up the phone. Then Jamie Moore finds the phone number five years ago in the mobile phone address book. She doesn’t know if he had changed the number.
	
Chapter 52 Long time no see
	With the attitude of trying, Jamie Moore dials the phone, and a few seconds later, the phone is connected.
	In the evening, the entertainment of city a is called the territory of aristocratic.
	Only rich people will come here to be the losers.
	In fact, the reason that Jamie Moore come here is the request of people she wants to meets.
	Fortunately, she doesn't have to treat her, otherwise she will certainly unhappy to do this.
	"Jamie Moore, shall we go back?" Wendy says shyly, and she holds Jamie Moore’s arm tightly.
	Jamie Moore knows that she is shy, thus she pats Wendy’s head and says, "It's OK, I'm here! Don't you want to see him?"
	Only that people could make her best friend become a cute girl in a flash.
	"But..." Wendy is still a little afraid. Now she is different from her unusual image, and she is more feminine.
	But Jamie Moore does not give her any chance to retreat. She takes her directly and drags her to the appointed place.
	Jamie Moore opens the door and drags Wendy to walk into the room.
	But when Jamie Moore sees the proud man who is sitting on the sofa, the smile on her face suddenly changes.
	"Ah, Jamie Moore is coming." Bruce Hill puts down the microphone. He smiles when he sees Jamie Moore standing in the door.
	Following Bruce Hill’s eyes, Dan William sees Jamie Moore suddenly, and he also sees Wendy standing beside Jamie Moore.
	Wendy looks around shyly, and finally she sees the figure on the sofa.
	Duke Field.
	He gives people a sense of inexplicable security. Although there is no expression on his face, he is on Wendy’s heart.
	She has loved her from high school to now.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field are the elders of Jamie Moore and Wendy. Because Wendy loves Duke Field, so Jamie Moore also know them.
	"Brother Bruce Hill and brother Duke Field, long time no see." Jamie Moore smiles at them."
	She ignores Dan William directly. She only knows that they are good friends and classmates when she returns home. But Dan William is busy in managing the company and he seldom goes to school, so Jamie Moore doesn’t know him.
	Looking at Duke Field who sitting beside Dan William, she feels a sense of disappointment. How could her good friend like such an ice cube.
	If that person is Bruce Hill, the thing will be much simpler.
	Bruce Hill just wants to give Jamie Moore a hug. Suddenly, Dan William coughs. He stops immediately.
	Oh, my God, he almost kills himself.
	"I haven't seen you for a long time, Wendy." Bruce Hill takes Wendy’s hand and touches her hair.
	Since that he can’t touch Jamie Moore’s hair, he could touch Wendy’s hair.
	But Bruce Hill doesn’t know that a pair of eyes is staring zt him.
	"Brother Bruce Hill, long time no see." Wendy has know them for a long time, so they are familiar with each other.
	"Duke Field, brother Dan William, long time no see." Wendy says hello to Duke Field. She glances at Duke Filed for several times, and then she redraws her eyesight.
	Dan William nods faintly, and his eyes always fall on Jamie Moore, who is smiling and treacherous.
	What does this woman do at this time?
	Jamie Moore feels angry with Bruce Hill. It’s nothing that he brings Duke Filed here. But how he brings Dan William here.
	After thinking for a while, she has no idea. After all, this three men always stay together. How could he be so careless?
	Jamie Moore pulls Wendy to sit beside Duke Filed. Wendy sits close to Duke Filed and she is next to Wendy.
	Bruce Hill looks at Dan William, and then he walks to Jamie Moore and says, "Jamie, this is my place, you can only sit there."
	He points to the position beside Dan William. It seems that he is afraid, but he is very happy.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She clearly remembers that Bruce Hill is sitting on the left side of Dan William's left hands when she comes in.
	Bruce, how dare you to calculate me?
	I will let you can’t find the direction later.
	Jamie Moore smiles and then sits down beside Dan William.
	Feeling that the eyesight of Dan William moves away, Bruce Hill feels very happy.
	The atmosphere in the box is a little quiet. No one speak, and the atmosphere is suddenly embarrassed.
	So Bruce Hill stands up and says, "We haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's play games."
	After finishing this words, he takes a deck of cards out and then puts on the table, "The rules are the same as before. People who draw the same suit must do the request of the people who draw the same suit. They can't object. If they object, they will be fined for three drinks."
	The aim that Bruce Hill come here is to make Dan William and Jamie Moore more close. And he doesn’t know that Wendy loves Duke Filed.
	Looking at the Duke Filed who sitting beside her, Wendy breath heavily, and her heart beating hardly.
	"Then I'll come first." Bruce Hill takes the lead in drawing one and looks at them.
	Dan William draws out a picture at will, and he has no expression after glancing at it.
	Duke Filed even does not look at it, and he puts the card to the other side.
	Bruce Hill is speechless, can you give me some face?
	Wendy chooses the cards for several seconds, and then she takes one card.
	She can't be careless. If she draws the same suit with someone, she will be punished by Bruce Hill heavily.
	"Fortunately, my card is trump card. Hurry up." Bruce Hill's eyes suddenly brightened, and he looks at other people.
	Dan William and Duke Filed opens the card, and it is spade five and plum ten respectively.
	As for Jamie Moore and Wendy, one is diamond one and the other is plum five.
	Duke Filed and Wendy are the same!
	Wendy is nervous, and she doesn’t know where she could watch. The card in her hands are just like a hot potato. And the temperature is very high.
	Bruce Hill looks at each other, and then he snaps his fingers and says, "We are all acquaintances.
	So Duke Filed, please kiss Wendy!"
	Jamie Moore laughs. She looks at this two people, and she praises Bruce Hill in her heart.
	"Go, you are such a naughty man." Duke Filed says, which make Wendy's heart beat. "Can't you afford to play this? Wendy does mind. You are a man, and you can’t be in such a way.
	Bruce Hill looks at Duke Filed and he pretends to be disgusted.
	Duke Filed looks at Wendy, and then he kisses her.
	This kiss is different from what the kiss should be. It’s soft and slowly. His lips is very hot which is
	different from his character.
	"You are bullying me, aren’t you? Can this be considered as a hot kiss?" Bruce Hill looks Duke
	Filed who just finishes kiss. He despises this kind of kiss which has no technical content at all.
	"If you have experience, you could do it." Duke Field says carelessly.
	Wendy is shy for Duke Filed’s kiss, but this sentence make Wendy’s heart fell to hell.
	In fact, it's just a game. She should not think more.
	Jamie Moore looks at Wendy who is thinking more about the thing happened right now, and then she signs.
	Secret love is doomed to be a very painful thing.
	"You should not mind it, Wendy. It's just a game." Duke Filed quickly turns to explain to Wendy.
	But he does not know that his explanation, which he really thinks is kind to Wendy, seems to verify the idea just appears in Wendy’s heart.

Chapter 53 Metamorphosis is rampant
	It's really just a game.
	"It doesn't matter, Duke Filed. I don't care about that." Wendy smiles at him, but the smile is pale and bitter in the light.
	Duke Filed nods slightly.
	Bruce Hill shuffles the cards and he asks everyone to continue to play. This time, he is not the trump card and he draws red six.
	Jamie Moore looks at the card in her hand, and then she presses her lips. She looks at Dan William quietly, and then her eyes become bright.
	Trump card?
	She quickly grabs the card in Dan William's hand and then shoves it into her own hand. Without ant hesitation, she puts the card on the table and says, "I'm sorry, I'm the trump card!"
	Dan William is surprised, he smiles and then he puts the card s on the table.
	Unfortunately, Duke Filed and Bruce Hill also have the same card at this time.
	"Jamie, I have see all the thing. It’s you that catch the card in Dan William’s hand!" Bruce Hill points at Jamie Moore angrily.
	"Who tells you that? Can anyone prove it? " Jamie Moore stares at him with a straight face.
	"They can prove it. Brother, Duke Filed, do all of you see the process?” Bruce Hill says excitedly.
	He will never let Jamie Moore treat with him by trump card!
	Jamie Moore suddenly feels sad. She looks at Dan William and she is worried. She only hopes that Dan William could hope her.
	Dan William leans back. He is smoking and he glances at Duke Filed and says, "No."
	These two words stand for his position.
	Jamie Moore relieves, and she blinks and smiles.At last, Jamie Moore was relieved and gave a mischievous wink, which made him laugh.
	The delicate face is full of smile. She is very beautiful and her eyes is full of star. She has a small nose and she is very beautiful. She has a well-shaped lips. Other people will be very happy when they see the smile of Jamie Moore.
	Duke Filed helplessly shakes his head and he looks at Bruce Hill with an expression of "Why are you so stupid". A man will help his wife. Do you want Dan William help you? Why are you so stupid?
	"I also see nothing." Duke Filed says.
	Bruce Hill's face suddenly become dark. How can this brother stab him at the critical moment.
	Jamie Moore proudly raises her eyebrows. After thinking for a while, she says, "Please go outside and find a post and then kiss it. At the same time, you should says something sweet to the post, and the time is five minutes!"
	What?
	Bruce Hill is shocked suddenly. This way tell others that Miss. Duke has no girl friend, and he even can’t play with a woman. Is he lonely and empty enough to find a pillar to vent?
	"Brother..." Bruce Hill looks at Dan William pitifully. It means that if you don’t help me, I will die.
	Dan William wrung out the cigarette end and then says with a smile, "My dear man, I’m a man, and I will do everything to make up since I’m loser."
	Bruce Hill stands up angrily and says, "Am I a child?"
	Then he opens the door and then leaves.
	Five minutes later, the door of the box is opened. Bruce Hill walks in with a bruised face. He walks in and looks around. It seems that he doesn’t find anything, and then he walks out with a colored spray in his hand.
	Seeing that the thing changed, Dan William and Duke Filed stands up and walks out hurriedly.
	Then Jamie Moore and Wendy also walks out immediately.
	Bruce Hill is very angry. He is Mr. Hill. It’s nothing that he kisses a pillar and says sweet words to pillar. But suddenly a woman runs out to fight and kick him, and she even scolds him as a great pervert!
	Is there have such a handsome pervert?!
	Bruce Hill can’t bear it . thus when he walks in, he takes the spray out and walks out.
	"Do you still want to beat by me? It seems that you are handsome man. How can you be such a freak? " The woman is a pretty girl, but her temper is not good. Seeing that Bruce Hill walks toward her, she sneers.
	There are all kind of people in these years.
	She never sees a man who kisses a pillar and he even says sweet words to the pillar.
	She is Anna Pork. She has seen many people. If she has not come here today, she would not have known that there is such a wonderful person in the world.
	This man holds the pillar and kisses the pillar. And he even says sweet words to the pillar. Does this man send by Toby?
	"Have you ever seen such a handsome pervert? You are a dead woman. I will give you some punishment! " There are several cuts on Bruce Hill's face with color. His face turns black and she even wants to beat Anna Pork.
	"Do you want to give me some punishment? OK, I think I don’t get enough punishment. How do you want to punish me?" Anna Pork points at her beautiful and then she glances at Bruce Hill.
	In these days, perverts are really rampant.
	"You!" Bruce Hill can’t stand it. When Dan William goes to there, they see Bruce Hill put the spray toward Anna Pork.
	Anna Pork does not expect that he would do this. She is spray with colorful gas before he gets his sense.
	Suddenly, a thin layer of solid covers Anna Pork’s face. All of her body are full of solid. She losses his momentum suddenly.
	"You are pervert!" Anna Pork roars. And then she kicks Bruce Hill heavily.
	Jamie Moore appreciates her and then she says in her heart-she does a good job. Few girls in their country dare to treat these rich young masters like this.
	Wendy looks at Jamie Moore, but there is a strange feeling in her heart. It seems that there are the same person.
	"Wow! You dare to kick me! Believe it or not, I will throw you out now...Ah! Bad woman, where are you going to kick? You should take away your pig's hoof. Do you know who I am? "Ah!" Bruce Hill roars. If he could hit a woman, the dead woman would have been thrown out.
	Hearing the noise, Manager comes over and checks it. But as soon as he wants to stop it, he is stopped by Duke Hill.
	He wants to see Bruce Hill in such a state. It’s so wonderful.
	"Enough." Dan William stops the talk between them. The king's momentum is very strong, and people will afraid of this truly.
	Even Anna Pork, who wants to fight and kick Bruce Hill, stops subconsciously. She looks at Dan William, and she could not help shivering.
	This man is really terrible. His eyes are sharp and his breath is cold. Anna Pork feels that his breath is manipulated.
	"Hello, lady, if she does anything disrespectful to you, please tell us, and we can teach him a lesson for you." Duke Filed pulls Bruce Hill who squats on the corner, and says lightly.
	Do something bad to herself? Anna Pork is shocked.
	Except that he kisses the pillar and says something sweet to pillar, he almost does nothing bad to her.
	So what about her?
	Anna Pork immediately frowns regretfully. Dan William see all of these clearly.
	"If you can't give us a satisfactory answer, we can completely accuse you of intentionally hurting people." Dan William says lightly.
	
Chapter 54 How about kissing skills from Dan William?
	Bruce Hill has never been beaten by other people since he is born in the word, and now he is beaten by a woman.
	Bruce Hill must have lost all of his pride.
	Anna Pork's face suddenly turns white. She never excepts that she would make such a big trouble because of her impulse.
	After all, it seems that all of these people have a strong family background.
	She just returns back to China for the first day, and she has such a bad luck!
	When she feels helpless, a soft voice comes, "I'm sorry, everyone, my naughty sister causes such a big disaster. Please forgive her."
	Anna Pork becomes happy suddenly and then she looks at the direction where the voice comes.
	A slender figure comes slowly from the corner. Then a man, dresses in a white suit and wears black shiny leather shoe, appears. He exudes an elegant and sunny temperament. He just like a little sun, and other people even could feel the warm sunshine on his body even if he doesn’t smile.
	He looks very handsome, and he just likes the flat model in the magazine. His body is full of unique charm luster. He is so handsome that we even could use extremely beautiful to describe him.
	At the first sight of this man, Jamie Moore subconsciously feels that she is familiar with the man.
	But she has never seen this man.
	"Brother!" Anna Pork jumps into John Pork's arms happily.
	John Pork rubs her hair and looks at Dan William who is standing in front of him, and his eyes shines slightly.
	Dan William feels the hostility from John Pork. His eyes are cold.
	"There is nothing to forgive someone, and she just needs to apologize to us." Duke Filed stares at John Pork for a few seconds. Then Bruce Hill also nods. At the critical moment, he won't be fooling around.
	Anna Pork looks at John Pork with a reluctant expression. But even so, she still pretends to be calm and walks to Bruce Hill, "I'm really sorry just now. I'm sorry."
	Bruce Hill has a dark face. His mood does not become good for Anna Pork’s apology. Anyone can see the unwillingness on his face.
	"You don’t need to do that. You should take her out of my sight quickly." Bruce Hill laughs sarcastically. He looks at Anna Pork as if he is looking at a patient who has not taken medicine.
	Today, he has gained a lot of insight. Beautiful women are not necessarily ladies, and they maybe are shrews.
	Anna Pork puffs up her cheeks angrily. She wants to say something, but she is pulled away by John Pork, so she has no choice but to give up.
	"Thank you so much." John Pork smiles gracefully and pulls Anna Pork away.
	When he passes Jamie Moore, the smile on her face seems to be big suddenly. It’s just like sunshine, which make people feel warm.
	Jamie Moore is shocked suddenly. She turns around to look at Anna Pork and John Pork, and watches them walks away.
	I'm so familiar with this man.
	"Brother, don't you know that man is a big pervert? Why should I apologize?" Anna Pork holds John Pork’s arm, and she feels sad.
	"Why are you so naughty? I just leaves for a while, and you will be gone." John Pork fondly pinches Anna Pork's nose, and his voice flows like water, which seems to be different from the voice right now.
	Although his voice is still soft and warm, the voice is different from the voice right now.
	"Brother, have you found her now?" Anna Pork looks at John Pork curiously and then asks. She knows that John Pork loves a person. When she is in England, her brother is often dazed by a picture of a woman and he often leaves early and comes back late, so Anna Pork concludes that her brother loves someone.
	She just doesn’t know who has so much charm that could catch her brother’s heart.
	Anna Pork nods softly, "Well."
	"That's very kind. When can I go to see her?"
	"Sometime in the future..."
	As they walks away, they voice also become farther and farther away.
	Backing to the box, Bruce Hill pretends that nothing has happened. He still eats and drinks like an innocent person. He looks heartless as if the person who has just been beaten up is someone else, not him at all.
	But Jamie Moore and other people all know that it is not Bruce Hill who tries to be heartless. In fact, he is heartless truly.
	It's really easy to live like that.
	Dan William is very lucky tonight. And he can get the trump card every time.
	Jamie Moore acts fast. She catches the trump card of Dan William every time. Bruce Hill is miserable all night, but the place is only in this box.
	If Bruce Hill meets this woman one day, he can’t bear it.
	But this time, Bruce Hill becomes smart. If Jamie Moore’s request is too difficult, he will punish himself by drinking three glasses of wine. Even people have a good drinking capacity, he can’t bear it.
	In Jamie Moore’s eyes, Bruce Hill is really stupid. If he punishes himself with three cups in the first
	set, or he turns around a few times outside, instead of holding a post and hugging it, he would not be beaten so badly.
	"Come! Continue! I don't believe I’m so bad tonight! " Bruce Hill obviously drinks too much. He takes a card casually and slaps it on the table without looking.
	Trump card!
	"Hahahaha, I know that I will have a good lucky. Hurry up, you guys. Hurry up!"Bruce Hill laughs proudly and then he points at the man opposite him, and he smiles loudly.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. Seeing the card that is put on the table by Dan William, she prays in her heart. She wishes that she would not be so unlucky.
	She is shocked when she puts the cards on the table. Why does she has such a bad lucky? And could she even buy a big Lotto with this fate?
	Spade two! She has spade eight in her hand. And she has the same color with Dan William.
	It’s true that every dog has its day. This words suddenly appears in Jamie Moore’s mind.
	She only hopes that Bruce Hill will never ask her to kiss a tree on the street, and says something sweet to the tree...
	“How about kissing skills from Dan William?” Seeing that Jamie Moore and Dan William has the card of the same color, his eyes become bright suddenly.
	Jamie Moore chokes. She reminds of the kiss from Dan William that night, and then she presses her lips, "Just so so."
	Hearing this word, Dan William’s face turns dark, and he stares at Jamie Moore angrily.
	Duke Filed stays away from Dan William. But in this way, he is much more closer to Wendy.
	Wendy even could smell the good smell of Cologne on Duke Filed’s body, and her face turns red instantly.
	"In these five years, who do you miss most between us?" Bruce Hill continues to ask. Although he drinks a lot, he could still feel the fierce eyes of Dan William. He seems to be killed by Dan William by his eyesight, thus he dares not ask too much.
	Wendy also looks at Jamie Moore curiously. As her best friend, she knows that the answer is Dan William naturally. But five years has passed, will the answer be the same as before?
	Dan William carries a glass of wine in his hand. His face has no expression. He looks at Jamie Moore who is in thinking, and he feels very worries.
	
Chapter 55 Do you like kissing others?
	"Actually, what I miss most is the chestnut cake in grapefruit street." Under the expectant eyes of several people, Jamie Moore slowly says an answer that surprised everyone.
	Chestnut cake?
	All people are shocked, and they all looks at Dan William silently.
	Dan William's fingers holds the wine glass tightly, and the joints even become white. The unpredictable expression make Bruce Hill fall back directly. He thinks that if he is dizzy, Dan William will do nothing to him.
	Jamie Moore only feels cold around her. It’s cold and sharp. She holds her arm subconsciously. Fortunately, Dan William does not do anything bad to her.
	The party doesn't end until after 11 o'clock. Bruce Hill pretends that he is drunk and he does not open his eyes. He is naturally shoved into the car by Duke Filed, and then he take Wendy to home by the way.
	In fact, the direction of his home is not at the direction of him. But he wants to create more opportunity for Jamie Moore and Dan William to get alone.
	Black Bugatti Weaver shuttles through the streets of the city.
	Jamie sits quietly in the front passenger seat. The atmosphere in the car is very stiff. The cool wind keeps blowing in from the half-opened window. Jamie Moore, who drinks a lot of wine, is clear now.
	The side face of Dan William is reflected in the mirror. Jamie Moore doesn’t know what he is thinking. He puts his elbows on the side of the window, and his fingers are slightly bent against his chin. Jamie Moore knows that Dan William will have this action when he is in a bad mood.
	He is unhappy.
	Looking at the sight outside the window, Jamie Moore losses her mind for a moment.
	He looks like Brother Dan in memory.
	When she is a child, she lives in the rich area for a while.
	She vaguely remembers that when she meets Brother Dan for the first time, she is still young. But she has learned how to run. At that time, she really likes to eat sweet and greasy things, especially chestnut cake.
	At that time, her mother would bring her some chestnut cakes every day from that pastry shop in grapefruit street.
	Jack Moore comes to see them occasionally. He seems to love her mother, but in fact, the relationship of them has been broken. But at that time, she doesn’t know all of this. She is just illegitimate daughter, and her mother is just a junior.
	She still remembers that in order to catch up with a Samoye, she accidentally drops the chestnut cake on the ground and the chestnut cake rolls to the next door.
	She quickly stands up, and she wants to pick the cake up. Suddenly. A little boy with fat hands picks the cake up.
	Little Jamie Moore looks up and she sees that the little boy is looking at the chestnut cake carefully. Little Jamie Moore, who likes chestnut cake like life, is in a hurry. She bites his hand hardly, and then the chestnut cake fall to the ground.
	Little Jamie does not pick it up, and she even steps on it hardly.
	She is small at that time, and of course her strength would not be so strong.
	"You are bad, and you are so bad!" Little Jamie make a face at the little boy, then she runs home with her short leg.
	Since then, Little Jamie has been running to the next room with her chestnut cake when her mother is not at home every day.
	Then she will leave two dirty fingerprints on his clothes, and she will eat all the chestnut cakes in front of him.
	Jamie Moore lowers her head. She doesn’t know that her memories are gradually intertwined with the man.
	"Brother, chestnut cake." She murmurs.
	Squeak --
	Jamie Moore lunges forward reflexively. Fortunately, he does not hit because he is wearing his seat belt.
	"What's the matter?" Jamie Moore turns her head to look at Dan William who stops the car on the street. He parks the car beside the road. His whole face is gloomy, and he narrows his black eyes dangerously.
	"Do you remember of something?" Dan William looses his hands on the steering wheel. He unbuckles his seat belt, and then approaches Jamie Moore slowly. His voice is a little low because he drinks wine, but it is more sexy.
	Jamie Moore sits to the side of the seat. She is a little confused about his approach. The doubts flashes in his eyes. "Are you brother Dan?"
	"You remember chestnut cake, don't you remember me?" Dan William approaches to her. The warm breath sprays on her face, which is very attractive.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore bits her lower lip, and she opens her eyes widely.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he says, "what do I want to do? I just want to prove it. "
	After finishing his words, he kisses Jamie Moore immediately.
	Jamie Moore stares at him incredulously. It’s the second time that he kisses her hardly. Does he like kissing others hardly?!
	Dan William holds her face, which makes her unable to break away. Her long eyelashes vibrate gently on her face. Dan William looks at her attentively and seriously, and it seems that she is his rare treasure.
	Rare treasure?
	Jamie Moore doesn’t know why she has such idea. She just feels a little dizzy in his mind, which is just like a circle of whirlpool. The more he sees, the more dizzy he become.
	The temperature in the car rises slowly. After a long time, Dan William lets go of Jamie’s hand.
Chapter 56 Where are you taking me?
	Jamie Moore leans on the door of the car, but she is nervous. It’s just like she has run a thousand meters. Her face is red, and she is a little shy.
	"Are you sure my kissing skill is just so so?" Dan William holds his chin with the back of his hand, and his black eyes are shining brightly. He looks at Jamie Moore lazily.
	"Just so so! The fact is worsen than this! " Jamie Moore roars angrily at him. It’s clear that he just wants to feel her up!
	Why does he need to prove this from her?
	"Do you want to try again?" Dan William is very patient, and she is just like teasing a cat. But a cat also has a temper.
	Hearing this, Jamie Moore opens the door and goes out, and then slams the door loudly.
	"Try it by yourself! I’m not available! " Jamie Moore says clearly. Then she walks forward. Although the front is also a road, she still feels desolate when she just walks by the side.
	But she should finish what she choose.
	Jamie Moore won't compromise so easily.
	"It's not safe here at night. You can think what the news says." Dan William drives beside Jamie Moore and scares her deliberately.
	Jamie Moore shakes her body, and then the words “a devil who will throw corpse on the road” appears on her mind.
	"Since you are not afraid, I will go." Dan William speeds up and then return to the road.
	It’s very late at the moment, and Joe Mo could only see himself on the road.
	Jamie Moore snobs her red noses. Suddenly, she is a little scared. And then she holds her arms tightly and walks forward slowly.
	But she never think that Dan William will leave her alone. She's just an asshole!
	Her little baby is more cute!
	After walking for a while, Jamie Moore feels that her legs are ache, but she still walk out of here. There are no cars passing by except trees and weeds.
	A drip of rain fall on the tip of her nose. Jamie Moore looks up and looks at the sky. More and more raindrops fall down, so she has to run and hide under a tree. As soon as she runs to the tree, the rain become heavily.
	She has drunk some wine before, and now she is caught in the rain and wind. Thus she can not bear it, so she squats on the wet ground.
	Jamie Moore buries her face between her knees,and her eyes are full of misty, and the pain in her brain left her has no way to think other thing.
	Dan William is just trying to scare Jamie Moore. If she is scared, she would call him later.
	But he hasn't receive her call for a long time. When the car is about to get on the highway, it rains, which make the night become more gloomy.
	Dan William immediately turns around and drives back. He speeds up and shows no care to the slippery of the road.
	Damn it, how could he make such a low-level mistake?
	If there anything happens to Jamie Moore...
	Dan William is very nervous and his hands which is holing the steering wheel become white.
	The car return to the place where he put Jamie Moore down. Dan William looks at the road carefully, but Jamie Moore’s figure is not the night, and he could not find her anywhere.
	Dan William opens the door. He shows no care the rain and he walks to the road and finds Jamie Moore carefully.
	"Jamie Moore!"
	Suddenly, Jamie Moore seems to hear someone is calling her. Although he is very tired, she still raises her eyes and heads.
	"Jamie Moore!" This sound is clearer than before.
	But Jamie Moore thinks that this is his hallucination, so she does not answer him.
	"Jamie Moore! If you hear my voice, please answer me!" Dan William walks closer to the place where Jamie Moore stays. He is very nervous in his heart.
	Time seems go back to the day when Jamie Moore leaves. When she leaves five years ago suddenly, he finds all the place where she would be, but he fails.
	Now he is regret. If he does not leaves her alone, what will the thing be?
	Dan William?
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes. Seeing the figure under the true, she tries all his efforts to stands up. She scolds. It lucky that she is not away from the place she gets off, otherwise, her legs will break.
	"I'm here!" Jamie Moore says loudly with a strong nasal voice.
	Although the sound is very loud, it is also brushed off by the rain. It lucky that Dan William still capture the subtle sound.
	"Jamie Moore?" Dan William is happy, and then he strides to the source of the voice.
	The figure under the tree is Jamie Moore.
	Looking at the Dan William who walks to her in the rain, Jamie Moore is grievance. Then she grabs Dan William’s clothes, and says fiercely, "If you leave me next time, I will castrate you!"
	Although the voice is hoarse, but she still has a good spirit.
	Dan William relieves. He puts the hands on Jamie Moore’s forehead, the temperature is higher than the temperature of his body.
	"You have got a fever." Dan William frowns. He looks at Jamie Moore who has a red face, then he picks her up. And then he walks to the direction of the car.
	Dan William covers Jamie Moore with his suit coat. Then he walks to the door and puts Jamie Moore on the back seat. Then he takes her wet coat off and puts it aside, and then he covers Jamie Moore with a blanket.
	"Where are you taking me?" Jamie Moore squints. Although she fells uncomfortable, she still has conscious, thus she asks.
	"Go to your house." Dan William says lightly as he starts the engine.
	What?!
	Jamie Moore sit up suddenly with an open eye. Go to her house?
	The Family Moore or my small apartment? Jamie Moore swallows. She feels that her throat is very dry.
	"Apartment." The speed is very fast, but Dan William drives very smoothly. The nearest place from here is Jamie Moore's apartment. Otherwise, his first choice will be the manor.
	Jamie Moore’s heart is suddenly raised. If they go back to the apartment, will Ian Moore find this?
	It's too dangerous!
	She touches her pocket, and then takes the cell phone out. She sends a message to the spare cell phone at home quickly.
	"Honey, mommy has something to do tonight. You'll stay with your aunt Wendy for one night first." There is an expression behind it.
	Jamie Moore is really confused. It's almost early in the morning. Is it good to ask Ian goes to the house of Wendy?
	Ian Moore keeps silent when he receives the message. Mommy wants to take somebody home, thus she asks him to live in Wendy’s house for one night.
	After all, in the past, no matter what happens to Jamie Moore, she never asks him to go the house of others.
	Besides, it's already 12 o'clock.
	Ian Moore puts the laptop on his leg down, and then turns it off. Then he puts the laptop on his backpack, and then he puts his own things in the living room and bathroom into the room, and then locks the door.
	After doing all this, Ian Moore walks to the porch and replaces his leather shoes. He holds the key in his hand and whistles, and then he walks out of the apartment in a handsome way.
	
Chapter 57 She has a high fever
	Wendy's apartment is not far from here, so Ian Moore can get there by walking for ten minutes.
	Although Ian Moore walks alone on the road, he is not afraid. The reason is that Night.1 and his partners will protect him in the dark, so he never avoids the problem of safety.
	When arrives at the Wendy’s apartment, Ian Moore walks into the elevator.
	As soon as Ian Moore walks into the elevator, Duke Filed just gets out of the elevator. Ian Moore presses the key of the elevator and then watches the door close slowly.
	Duke Filed seems to remind of something, then he looks back. He sees the face of Ian Moore before the door is closed. He is shocked that the phone in his hand almost fall down to the ground.
	Duke Filed is shocked. The child he sees right now is too familiar...
	It seems that he has seen that child somewhere...
	Ian Moore grabs the belt on both sides of his chest. He looks at the number on the elevator, and then the elevator stops on the eleventh floor.
	He has heard from mommy that Aunt Wendy is also the daughter of a rich group. She comes out to work without telling her family, but she lives in a good place. Only Wendy lives in this floor. When the elevator is opened, he will reach the house of Wendy.
	Ian Moore takes out the key and opens the door, and then he walks in.
	"Why?" Wendy comes out when she hears the sound. Then she find the person is Ian Moore.
	"Ian, now it’s so late, why do you come here? Don’t you afraid that you mommy will beat you?" Wendy jumps over to holds Ian Moore, and she rubs his little face happily.
	"It's mommy who let baby come here. Aunt Wendy, you must take care of me." Ian Moore blinks his big eyes and then looks at her pitifully.
	Wendy pinches Ian Moore's face painfully. "Of course, aunt Wendy will keeps you. There is no problem that you live here for a long time."
	Wendy likes Ian Moore very much. She even wants to have one baby.
	But when she thinks of Duke Filed, who has a cold character, she sighs.
	"But Ian, why have you slept so late? Hasn’t Your mommy come back?” Wendy looks at the clock on the wall, and then she asks in disbelief. Isn't the child going to sleep very early?
	Besides, if Jamie Moore goes home, she doesn't need to let Ian Moore come to her. The fact maybe Jamie Moore needs to take someone back, and she can’t let this people know the existence of Ian Moore.
	Dan William.
	There is no one but him.
	Wendy looks at Ian Moore pitifully, and then she scolds Dan William in her heart. Even if he doesn’t know the fact, if he doesn’t break Jamie's heart, how could Ian Moore not see his father?
	Ian Moore blinks his big eyed for a few times quickly, and then says, "I’m asleep, but I am woken up by mommy."
	I'm sorry, Mommy. I need to use you as a shield.
	The black Bugatti velon stops downstairs at Jamie Moore’s apartment. The light fades as time goes on, and soon it become dark.
	Dan William picks Jamie Moore up, who is lying in the back seat, and the walks towards the apartment.
	"Which floor do you live?" Dan William walks into the elevator and asks.
	Jamie Moore says without opening her eyes, "Seventh floor."
	Dan William presses the button, and then the elevator goes up. In the silent elevator, only Jamie Moore’s long and heavy breath could be heard.
	She leans on the chest of Dan William. Dan William’s heart beats steadily and strongly. Jamie Moore stays under the rain for several minutes, thus her clothes are a little wet. She feels more comfortable after leaning on the cheat of Jamie Moore.
	“Ding” the elevator stops at the seventh floor, and then Dan William walks out of the elevator. He walks into the house of Jamie Moore according to Jamie Moore’s introduction.
	He turns on the switch on the wall, and the interior suddenly lights up like daylight. Dan William glances at the interior decoration. It’s decorated by warm colors, and it seems very warm. Things are placed randomly but not disorderly. There are two pillows on the soft, which could catch people’s eyes.
	This makes Dan William reminds that the little baby he meets in the cake shop. That little baby leaves two dolls, which are the same as this one.
	Jamie Moore looks around nervously, and she relieves when she finds Ian Moore is not here.
	It's just like being attacked suddenly.
	If Dan William sees Ian Moore, she may can’t get out of this room alive today...
	"Do you have a thermometer?" Dan William puts her on the sofa. He asks after he glances at the two pillows on the sofa.
	"Yes, the thermometer is in the drawer on the right under the table." Jamie Moore puts his head on the soft pillow. Her hair is still wet, so the pillow soon is soaked by water.
	Hearing this, Dan William squats down and looks for the thermometer under the table in front of the sofa. He soon finds it.
	He puts the thermometer in Jamie Moore's ear for a while, and then it shows that it’s thirty-eight five. She really has a fever.
	He takes out his cell phone to dial a number and put it in his ear.
	"Hello, it's me...Now you should come to Pennies House. immediately. The room is on the seventh floor...I don't care what you're doing with your wife. You must have to be there in 15 minutes! " Finishing these words. He throws the phone to the table, and he even rubs the hair of Jamie Moore’s wet hair.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes. Even though she is not in a good state, she still could not fall asleep. If she is careless, Dan William may find of something.
	Looking at Jamie Moore who lies on the sofa, and then he puts the pillow aside.
	Then he walks into the bathroom.
	Fortunately, the edge of the sofa is soft. Jamie Moore relieves, and she even thinks that he is going to murder her.
	After a while, Dan William comes out of the bathroom. He holds a clean white towel in his hand. He wears a white shirt on his body. Because the clothes is wet, so it’s pasted on his body. It could be seen that he owns a lean body, and people even could see the six abdominal muscles under the clothes. The scene even could make people blood.
	Jamie Moore squints at Dan William. Dan William only picks her up, and puts the white towel on her head. Dan William does it softly, and wipes the water on her hair.
	Jamie Moore is shocked, and she lets him wipe her hair.
	Occasionally, his fingertips would pass gently through her hair and across her scalp, which makes her shiver like an electric attacked her.
	It seems that she has not own such a moment for a long time.
	Jamie Moore’s face is red. It’s caused by the high temperature of the fever. Her beautiful eyes are full of water. Although her lips are dry, it’s still full of slight red, which make other people can’t move their eyes.
	"Why are you so nice to me?" In a trance, Jamie Moore asks what she thinks in her heart.
	The smile on Dan Moore’s mouths become stiff, and then he says, “Jamie Moore, you can’t do anything and you are really stupid,
	Jamie Moore feels very angry.
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely. Is she stupid? If she is stupid, why does he take her as the employee of the Cr.
	...What is she thinking? Who is stupid?
	When the doorbell rings, Dan William puts the towel between his arms and walks out to open the door.
	Jim Slater stands outside the door. He looks a bit messy, and he even does not tie his shoelaces well. He holds a medicine chest in his right hand and there are even some rain on his golden hair.
Chapter 58 Let me take care of you
	"Young master, am I late?" Jim Slater raises his glass on the bridge of his nose.
	Dan William nods lightly, and then he turns around and walks into the room. Jim Slater follows Dan William hurriedly.
	Jim Slater is Dan William's personal doctor. He is responsible for Dan William's health problems.
	Every month, he will go to the manor to check his health. In case of emergency, he is also on call.
	But Jim Slater doesn’t expect that Dan William would call him in the middle of the night. He is still making love with his wife. Receiving his phone, he dresses his clothes and rushes to the address that Dan William says.
	It’s the first time that Dr. Slater has been called outside the manor as a doctor.
	Slater is an Englishman, but it’s the first time that he goes out without tying his shoes.
	He takes Jamie Moore's temperature and then begins to dispense the medicine.
	"This is an external application. If we put it on the forehead, people will reduce the fever. This is for internal use. There is introduction on it." Jim Slater could not speak the language of C country well, but he tries all his effort to say the words, which make Jamie Moore almost laugh.
	It’s really full of funny.
	After Jim Slater leaves, Dan William picks up the anti fever sticker and looks at it for a few seconds. He tears it up, and then he lifts Jamie Moore’s coat up, and puts the the anti fever sticker on Jamie Moore’s stomach.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. How could he stick it on her stomach?
	"Dan William, you posts it on the wrong position..." Jamie Moore takes a glass of water to drink, then she feels that the anti fever sticker is posted on the wrong position. She feels speechless.
	"Huh?"Dan William picks up the bottle that Slater puts down. He is looking at the directions on it.
	"This should be stick on the forehead rather than stomach." Jamie Moore presses her lips. It's not used for stomachache. Why do you put the anti fever sticker on my stomach?
	Dan William’s hands which are holding the medicine bottle become stiff, and his face also become stiff, then---
	He tears the anti fever sticker up from Jamie Moore’s stomach, and then he puts it on Jamie Moore’s forehead.
	Click. The anti fever sticker is put on the head of Jamie Moore steadily.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes subconsciously, and she feels that her heart has collapsed. It’s right. This man even could not distinguish between salt and sugar. How could he know where should the anti fever sticker be stick?
	Dan William divides the medicine well and then hands it to Jamie Moore in the bottle cap, "Take it."
	Looking at the pills with different colors in the bottle cap, Jamie Moore swallows saliva. Is it OK to eat them?
	She is not worried about Dr. Slater's ability, but she is worried about Dan William deeply...
	Jamie Moore takes the bottle cap, and then she sniffs her nose. She can’t breath well, which is very uncomfortable.
	Every time Jamie Moore has a fever,Jamie Moore will ignore everything, though she hates eating medicine directly. Keeping good health is important than everything.
	There is no exception in this time.
	Maybe it's because of the power of medicine, Jamie Moore feels more tired than before. She looks at the ceiling, but she closes her eyes slightly. Now the breath is more smooth than before. Soon, she falls into sleep.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore falls asleep, Dan William stands up, and then he walks to the middle of the room of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore.
	He walks to the door of Ian Moore’s room, and she tries to open the door, but then she finds the door is locked. Thus he walks to the door of Jamie Moore’s room and he opens the door easily.
	He takes a quilt out from Jamie Moore's room, and then he puts it on Jamie Moore. He lifts Jamie Moore’s head gently, and then puts a pillow below Jamie Moore’s head.
	After doing all this, Dan William sits on the spot. He puts his elbows on the edge of the sofa, and looks at the sleep face of Jamie Moore.
	There is only the sound of clock leaves in the room,which gives other people an illusion of good time.
	When she is a child, she disappears suddenly. Five years ago, she appears in a hurry and then she disappears suddenly, which make him not sure that if she loves him or not.
	He sighs softly, then he measures the temperature on her white neck. It’s not so hot. It’s a sign of fever abatement.
	Half an hour later, he tears the anti fever sticker off and then throws it into the garbage can. He stands up and stares at her for a few seconds. Then He takes out his mobile phone. He turns on the camera function, and selects the angle and then takes a picture.
	Jamie Moore on the picture is as beautiful as the spirit. Although it's just a side face, she almost integrates herself into the painting.
	Suddenly, he is a little flustered. The eyesight in his black eyes changed suddenly. He puts his mobile phone back in his pocket, then he picks Jamie Moore up and walks into Jamie Moore’s room. After tucks her in well, Dan William turns around and leaves.
	In the next day, Jamie Moore, who is sleeping, feels hotter and hotter.
	She lifts her feet, and then she kicks the soft cover to one side. She turns over and continues to sleep, but she still feels hot.
	Jamie Moore gets up from the bed. She is still in a confuse mood, but her brain is clear now.
	Dan William is not here. It seems that he has leaves.
	Jamie Moore stretches. Then she looks at the time. It’s ten o'clock!!
	Suddenly, Jamie Moore stops worried. She does not rush to wash and then rush to work. Instead, she walks into the washroom slowly. She takes a shower and changes a clothes. It’s almost eleven o'clock when she comes out.
	She comes out as she wipes her hair with a towel.
	Suddenly, the sound come from the outside. Jamie Moore stops her action, and then she walks out with the towel in her hand.
	Hasn’t Dan William leaves the house?
	Jamie Moore walks out and she finds that the sound come from the kitchen. When she is about to walk into the chicken, Cindy Swift comes out.
	"Miss Jamie, you're awake. You can have lunch now." Cindy Swift comes out with a big porcelain bowl. Seeing Jamie Moore, she says with a smile.
	"Cindy Swift, why are you here?"Jamie Moore asks.
	"Young master tells me that you are ill and he asks me to take care of you." Cindy Swift arranges the dishes and chopsticks for her. Then she takes out medicine bottle that Dan William gives her, and she divides the medicine well and hands it to Jamie Moore, "Miss Jamie, are you better than before? You should have lunch first and take the medicine later."
	Jamie Moore nods. She lowers her head and no one could see the emotion of her, "I’m much better than before, thank you, Cindy Swift."
	"You should thanks young master." Cindy Swift quickly says something good of Dan William, "Young master let you to have rest at home. And you could go to work when you are well."
	"I see." Jamie Moore does not catch anything sweet from these word. Instead, she has some bitterness in her heart.
	If she could see Dan William when she wakes up, she would not be so uncomfortable even if he says that she is stupid.
	
Chapter 59 You shall wait for me!
	Cindy Swift cooks porridge for her especially. Porridge is made with herbs. Cindy Swift's cooking skill is always good, so there will be no bitterness in it. Jamie Moore eats all breakfast happily with the heart of satiety. The sense of loss in her heart disappears suddenly, and she touches her stomach happily.
	In fact, as a foodie, Jamie Moore is happy. What’s more, no matter how much she eats, she never becomes fat. So she never treats her stomach badly before eating.
	"Miss Jamie, I'll go back now and I will come back at dinner." Cindy Swift picks her bag up and then walks to the outside.
	Jamie Moore says quickly, "Cindy Swift, I'm much better now, and you don’t need to come here at night."
	If Cindy Swift still comes in the evening, Ian Moore has to stay at Wendy’s house all the time. Is it too crucial for Ian Moore? This is absolutely not!
	"But young master..."
	"Don't worry, Cindy Swift, and I'll take good care of myself." Jamie Moore smiles at her and then she swallows all the medicine in front of her.
	Seeing this, Cindy Swift is willing to go back at ease.
	As soon as Cindy Swift leaves, Jamie calls Wendy hurriedly. Knowing that Ian Moore is at school and Wendy doesn’t ravage him last night, she immediately relieves. She needs to go to a place since she has nothing to do this afternoon.
	Jamie Moore just does thing according to her heart. After changing the clothes, she goes upstairs and takes a taxi. The taxi leaves after knowing the destination.
	Then another car which has been parked downstairs at Jamie Moore's apartment follows immediately.
	In the villa of the Moore Family.
	After the company experiences the crisis, Celina Swift and Mia Moore are more haggard than before. It's said that Dan William puts the matter down, thus the media roars again. It's the first time that Dan William does this for another woman. Those who have gradually alienated the Moore Family come back again. So Jack Moore is very busy now.
	However, what surprises others is that Dan William cancels the cooperation with the Moore Family next day after he suppresses this matter for the Moore Family. No one knows the reason, and no one dares to doubt Dan William's callousness and changeability.
	He can give you some sweetness in the last second and he also can send you to hell in the next second.
	Even so, those people dare not to make trouble with the Moore Family anymore. Who knows if Dan William will cooperate with the Moore Family again in the next second?
	Celina Swift and Mia Moore are frightened by Jack Moore's roaring that day. In addition, although this event is suppressed by Dan William, people outside are still crazy about the gossip. Although the news is suppressed, the mouth of those people is the best and fastest communicator, thus Celina Swift and Mia Moore dares not go outside.
	It seems that some people are smashing thing outside. Celina Swift and Mia Moore are lying on the soft with mask on their face. Hearing the sound, they open their eyes. They want to ask somebody to look at it, but then they find servants had been driven away by Mia Moore.
	"Stop. Go out to see what's going on." In order that the last few servants are not driven away by Mia Moore, Celina Swift asks Mia Moore to have a look.
	"There is nothing to see out, and I don't want to go." Mia Moore pats the mask that she had just put on. She decides that she will never go out only when the thing is solved.
	But according to the current situation, it will take at least one or two months to dissipate the impact of this event, that is to say, she will not be able to go out for at least two months.
	"If the thief sneaks in, you will lose all the treasures." Celina Swift pokes Mia Moore’s head, and then she washes the mask and walks out.
	Mia Moore rolls her eyes to her mother. How could the security here be so bad?
	Recently, Mia Moore is in a bad mood. She will get angry when she encounters a little bit of small things. Besides, no one could let her vent now. Even if she wants to go out to find troubles with Jamie Moore, she minds the scornful and ironic eyes of other people!
	All these are given by Jamie Moore. It's better not to let her see her again, or she will kill her!
	"Ah! You little bitch! Hearing Celina Swift’s screaming voice, Mia Moore shivers. She opens her eyes, and washes the mask on her face, and then she walks out.
	"Are there any thieves? God! "Mia Moore walks to the courtyard. She opens her eyes widely after she finishes this word. She could not believe what she sees.
	The whole courtyard is in a mess, and everywhere is damaged. If there is something remains good, it’s the high chair that Jamie Moore sits and the table in front of her.
	Jamie Moore?
	"Why are you here?!" Mia Moore walks toward Jamie Moore angrily. Jamie Moore sits in the flower garden next to the swimming pool, thus if Mia Moore wants to walk to her, she must goes around the swimming pool. When she walks in the flower garden, her feet are covered with mud, and she feels more anger than before.
	Jamie Moore sits there with a calm expression. Her hands are stained with mud, and she washes the mud with the water which is used to make tea. Celina Swift is half kneeling in the mud and she is like a drowned mouse. She wants to plot against Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore aware what she wants to do and blocks her back.
	"Who allows you to walk into my house? You are bitch, get out of here! You are not welcome here!" Celina Swift, who lies on the ground, shouts at Jamie Moore.
	"This is my place. Why can't I come in?" Jamie Moore takes out a paper towel to dry the water stains on her hands. She looks at Celina Swift, who kneels in front of her and who wants to stand up but can’t, and then Jamie Moore raises her delicate chin and she is as proud as a queen.
	Celina Swift's legs are so weak that she could hardly stand. Her haggard face is almost purple.
	Mia Moore walks in the mud laboriously. The wet mud is all stained on her slippers. It’s so dirty that we even could not see the original appearance of the slipper. Mia Moore is so angry that she wishes to push Jamie Moore into the swimming pool at once, but now she could only stand in the mud, and she can’t move forward or retreat.
	"Ah!! Jamie More! You wait for me!" Mia Moore shouts with hate. She is very angry now. She wants to take her slippers off, but she can’t bear the mud stains on her feet.
	"Well, I'm waiting for you. You can come here quickly. I can't wait now." Jamie Moore claps her hands and says. She even picks up a set of tea cups on the table which she is not pleased, and then she throws those tea cups into the swimming pool. To be exactly, those tea cups falls on the edge of the swimming pool which makes a clear sound of breaking.
	"Ah! My cup!" Mia Moore feels painful. She brings it back from abroad. There are only three sets in the whole A City. She has been proud of it for a long time, but now it's all broken. This hurt her hardly!
	Jamie Moore presses her lips and then a smile appears in her face. She stands up, and grabs the high chair that she had just sits, and then she hit it on the ground hardly. The high chair falls on the ground and then breaks into two parts.
	"Jamie Moore, stop! I ask somebody to make this chair especially!" Mia Moore is so angry that her whole body is shivering. She has walks to the flower garden, or it should be said that she has walked to the middle of the mud. Seeing that all her treasures are smashed by Jamie Moore, she is very angry.
	
Chapter 60 Does he belong to you?
	"Stop? How can I stop now?" Jamie Moore smiles. Now she looks like a devil. She kicks the table aside. The table rolls in the mud, and several marks adds on it.
	Mia Moore is very angry. She walks to Jamie Moore. Her feet are very sore, but she still looks at Jamie Moore as if she could chop Jamie Moore up.
	But Jamie Moore doesn't think it's enough. She throws all the things that can be thrown to the swimming pool. Some of them are even stained with mud. Roses and the branches of the tree also fall in to the swimming pool. The scene is really disgusting.
	"You could try it again! You Daddy will fix you when he comes back!" Celina Swift looks at Jamie Moore with hateful eyes. She wishes that she could pierce a few holes in Jamie Moore's face.
	Jamie Moore walks to her, and then she squats down and looks at Celina Swift. Jamie Moore holds the dedicate necklace on Celina Swift’s neck, and then she pulls it off, and says, "So, this necklace doesn’t belongs to you. Is it comfortable to wear it?"
	Celina Swift's face turns pale. She knows that Jamie Moore means this necklace is her mother--Adele Gilbert’s necklace.
	"I don't know what you're talking about." Celina Swift’s heart jumps abruptly.
	"Can't you understand? Mia Moore, how could she come out now since your mother is suffering Alzheimer’s? It’s OK that you don’t treat yourself since you are ill. But now your mother is ill, how can’t you take your mother to the hospital and treat her?” Jamie Moore looks up and says to Mia Moore. She says all of this in a way that could make other people angry.
	"Bitch! Who are you scolding? I don’t suffer Alzheimer's!" Celina Swift is very angry, and her face is haggard as if she is several years old than before.
	"Don't be complacent, Jamie Moore! Don't you depend on Dan William? You are not Dan William’s wife, and now it’s too early to say the result!" Mia Moore raises her face, and she is sure that she will win.
	"Mrs. Dan? Mia Moore, are you kidding with me? If you can be Mrs. Dan, you will get that position in the past five years that I’m not here. I'm backing now. Why do you think that you have the chance?" About the last sentence, Jamie Moore is not very sure. But she could not care so much because she wants to make Mia Moore angry.
	Mia Moore smiles suddenly, and she walks to Jamie Moore closely. Her feet are covered with mud, but it does not affect the smile on her face. "Do you know the truth? Brother Dan has been my man in the past five years when you are not here. Don't be naive, Jamie Moore."
	"What’s your meaning?" Jamie Moore frowns. She presses her lips and her heart jumps quickly.
	"What’s the meaning? It means that your Brother Dan can't stand loneliness, so he has made love with me..." Mia Moore covers her mouth and smiles coyly. Mia Moore’s word makes other people thinks more.
	Jamie Moore’s face becomes stiff. She looks at Jamie Moore who stands in front of her, and she tries to find flaws on her face. However, there is only proud on her face. It seems that this thing is true.
	No, maybe it's true.
	"So? You are good at talking, right? Now you know that Brother Dan has been my man, do you feel sad? Jamie Moore, do you think you are only woman who can stay with him? With so many beauties, why does he just wait for you?" Mia Moore presses her lips, and her face is full of disdain.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes. She feels more and more sad, and the feeling of sad can’t be ignored in her heart.
	"Does he belong to you? Mia Moore, you think too high of yourself. Dan William doesn't want to put the label--his woman on you. Why do you think he's your man?" Even if Jamie Moore feels not good in her heart, she is unwilling to be laughed by others. Even Dan William leaves her alone in the morning.
	Even though she loses, she also wants to lose in a proud way.
	"You are such a woman. It's really too hard for Brother Dan to stay with you." Jamie Moore looks at Mia Moore as she says. Seeing that Mia Moore’s face is covered by mud, Jamie Moore smiles, and then she walks away.
	Mia Moore's mood is bad. Jamie Moore is really good at talking.
	"Jamie Moore, stop now!" Mia Moore wants to walks, but she has been stood in situ for a long time, thus the mud on her feet is stained with the mud on the ground and one jumped forward. She tries to walks, but she can’t. And then she falls on the ground like a turtle.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore walks into the villa, Celina Swift pulls Mia Moore’s clothes immediately and says, “Mia, are you sure that you have made love with Dan William?”
	Mia Moore's forehead has become red, and then tears fall from her eyes. And then she says, “Make love? If that is true, I'll wake up with a smile!"
	"Then why do you say that just now?!" Celina Swift has rejoiced too soon.
	"I just want to piss Jamie Moore off!" But Jamie Moore does not get angry, and instead, she gets angry.
	Celina Swift signs, and then she reminds that where is Jamie Moore?
	Jamie Moore walks into the villa. She is quite familiar with the villa. She walks to the second floor and then walks into the room of Adele Gilbert.
	The furnishings inside are the same as before. No one cleans the room, but the room is not very dirty. Jamie Moore walks into the room and then locks the door, and then she looks for the thing she needs.
	She thinks that she can find something, but finally she finds nothing.
	She knows from her mother's relics that she is not Jack Moore's child. She knows from the picture that Chris Lockwood is actually her brother.
	Mother mentions secret precept in her relics, so it’s very important.
	Jamie Moore squats on the ground and she thinks for a while. She has looked for every place in the room, but she still can't find it.
	If Jamie Moore knows Ian Moore has found that secret precept, and Ian Moore even finds the killing organization which originally owns ten people but now only owns five people, she will beat his little ass. He is really a naughty boy. If he takes the ring out early, she will not take risk in doing this thing.
	If Jamie Moore knows all of this before, the identity of her and Chris Lockwood who is still in the French will be revealed. In this way, things will be much more troublesome.
	Jamie Moore knows Adele Gilbert’s story in youth well, because Adele Gilbert likes to sit on the swing with Jamie Moore and tell these stories to Jamie. Jamie Moore never reads storybooks or comic books from the age of three. She is more interested in her mother’s story.
	Maybe this is the reason why Jamie Moore is so different.
	When Jamie Moore losses herself in thinking, she suddenly hears a sound--click. The door is locked by someone.
	Jamie Moore stands up immediately, and then she walks to the door. It’s true that the door is locked from the outside. No one will do this except Celina Swift and Mia Moore!
	"Ask the housekeeper to catch some mice and put them in!" Jamie Moore rolls her eyes when she hears Celina Swift’s words. Jamie Moore has her own plan, so she is not in a hurry to settle accounts with them. Jamie Moore sits by the door and waits for the housekeeper to bring the mouse.
	
Chapter 61 I will kill all of you!
	If she is afraid of mice, how can she be called Jamie Moore.
	"Madam, there are too few mice in the house, so I only catch four mice." Soon, the housekeeper puts the mice in a net bag and then he hands it to Celina Swift. When Celina Swift sees these black things, she jumps away immediately.
	"Why do you hand it to me? Put it in the bag quickly." Celina Swift jumps away and orders the housekeeper to put the mice into the room.
	The housekeeper doesn’t know that Jamie Moore is in the room. But he knows that the master doesn’t allow anyone to do bad thing to the room of the first madam, thus he says, “Madam, this...”
	“What? I am responsible for everything!" Celina Swift covers her nose and says.
	Mia Moore dares not walk close to them. The mice are the biggest enemy of the women, especially for the smell of the mouse. It’s too terrible!
	Hearing Celina Swift’s words, the housekeeper opens the door and puts the mice into the room, and then he closes the door quickly.
	"You stay at here. Do not let any mouse comes out. Are you clear?" After finishing the words, Celina Swift leaves with Mia Moore, and she is preparing to take a bath.
	Jamie Moore also acts quickly. As soon as the housekeeper throws the bag in, she jumps over and grabs the bag. Those black mice can't get out of the bag and they can only jump in the bag.
	Since you like mice so much, I'll let you enjoy it later.
	Jamie Moore looks around the room, and then she walks to the dresser with the bag in her hand. She puts the jewelry that Adele Gilbert loved most and some small things in the bag. What leaves behind is some jewelry that Adele Gilbert doesn’t like. Other people will never find that Jamie Moore take something away.
	In this way, with the thing that is going to happen, Jamie Moore is sure that Jack Moore will never find any clues.
	The housekeeper stays at the door for a while, and then he wants to go to toilet. Since the door is locked, nothing will be happened he thinks. Thus he goes to the toilets immediately.
	After taking a bath and changing new clothes, Celina Swift and Mia Moore feel very comfortable. They walk to the door of Adele Gilbert’s room slowly, but they don’t hear any screaming they want.
	"Where is housekeeper? Does she leave away?” Mia Moore twists the lock on the door and frowns.
	"Don't worry. The door is locked. She can’t leave now. She must have fainted for fear." Celina Swift is not worried about the situation inside at all.
	She doesn’t believe that four mice can’t beat Jamie Moore.
	Mia Moore nods, “Shall we go in to have a look?"
	Jamie Moore is eager to see the situation of Jamie Moore.
	Celina Swift holds the broom in her hands. She opens the crack shakily, but she finds that the room is very quiet. Thus she opens the door slowly, and she finds it’s very dark in the room.
	Mia Moore follows behind Celina Swift. She is afraid that mice will come out at any time.
	Seeing Mia Moore and Celina Swift walks into the room, Jamie Moore, who stands behind the door, is very happy. She never thinks they are so stupid, and they even walk into the room so quickly. Thus she says sorry to Adele Gilbert in her heart.
	Jamie Moore walks to the outside. She puts the bag into the room and closes the door quickly.
	"Ah!! Mom, I’m beaten by something!" Mia Moore screams, "Mom, is it a mouse?"
	"Mouse, where is the mouse? Don't be afraid. Ah! My shoes!" Celina Swift also screams, and she is not better than Mia Moore.
	"Mom, turn on the light. These mice are biting me! "Ah!" Things all falls on the ground and causes aloud sound. Then Mia Moore screams, and some fragile objects continue to fall on the ground and cause loud sound.
	"Where is Jamie Moore? It must is her idea!"
	"Mom, I can’t open the door! Ah! Dead mouse, I’m going to kill you!"
	"Don't pull my hair! Don't step on me!"
	Hearing the sound from the inside, Jamie Moore smiles, and then she walks toward the outside.
	When the housekeeper comes back, he does not think too much after hearing the sound in the room. He takes the cotton out and then put it in his ear...
	After walking out of the villa of the Moore Family, Jamie Moore walks to the William Family. Jamie Moore is in a trance when she sees the William Family from her position. Compared with the change of the Moore Family, the William Family has no change at all. Everything is the same as five years ago. The only difference is that no one lives in it now.
	After handing the Cr and the William Family to Dan William, Dan William’s parents begin to travel all over the word.
	Jamie Moore thinks she is happier than Dan William. Because she has mother. However, Dan William is always alone.
	She signs slightly. After reminding of Mia Moore’s words, Jamie Moore leaves away in a few minutes.
	If Jamie Moore wants to take a taxi, she needs to walk out of the villa area. It’s still early now, thus Jamie Moore is not in a hurry. She walks slowly on the road. She is the only one who walks on the road, and there even is a car behind her.
	The car stops outside the Moore Family until Jamie comes out. Seeing that Jamie Moore is alone, he stops the car in front of the Jamie Moore and then he rolls down the window.
	"Hello." A handsome face appears in the window. It seems that his smile is full of sunshine, which is very warm.
	Jamie Moore is a little shocked, and she doesn’t recognize him, "Who are you?"
	The smile on Hooson’s face becomes stiff. Then he introduces himself to Jamie Moore, "My name is Hooson. We have met each other in the entertainment club that day."
	After thinking for a while, Jamie Moore reminds that she has met this person that day. She even thinks she is very familiar with this man, “My name is Jamie Moore. Why are you here?"
	Jamie Moore feels that Hooson looks like one of her friend, so Jamie Moore's attitude towards him is not as cold as that of strangers. Thus she asks naturally. His temperament is almost the same as one of her friends, and the only difference is his appearance.
	She reminds that her friend never calls her since she returns back. Is he too busy?
	"I come here to find a friend. It’s so lucky that I meet you. I’m so sorry that day." Hooson smiles, which is very approachable.
	Jamie Moore knows what he says is the thing of beating Bruce Hill that day. Thus she says, “If you’re sorry for the thing, you should not say sorry to me. After all, it's not me who is beaten by your sister."
	Hooson never expects that Jamie Moore would say that. Because the ordinary people will say “Nothing, don't care about this". But it’s seems that her words is more candid and true.
Chapter 62 Who allows you walk into this house!
	"Where are you going? I can send you to the place."
	"No, my home is not far from here." Jamie Moore shakes her head. She is not very familiar with him, so she will not take a ride. As Ian Moore says, Jamie Moore doesn't take everyone's ride.
	"It's not safe for you to go back alone. Besides, am I like a bad person?" Hooson thinks that does he become ugly? Otherwise, how can a woman refuse him?
	Jamie Moore stares at him for a few seconds, and finally she says, "If the bad guys show themselves at a glance, there is no need for police in the world."
	So, handsome is not the key points. She has seen many handsome men. Her brother Dan is a domineering handsome man, and her brother is a charming handsome man, and she has a male friend who is a gentle handsome man. If she does not have a strong self-control, she really wants to ask him something.
	Do you lack a boyfriend?
	It’s the first time that Hooson questions his appearance. Does he look like a bad person?
	At last, Jamie Moore pats the shoulder of Hooson, and then she says earnestly, "I think you are qualified, so, do you want me to introduce some handsome guys to you? I can introduce all kind of handsome guys to you."
	"They're all good-looking guys."
	Hooson looks very embarrasses, and then he says angrily, “I’m a straight man!”
	What does she think he is? Gay?
	Hooson never thinks that he will be treated as gay by others one day! Where does he look like a gay?
	Jamie Moore looks at Hooson and then she nods, “I know.” then she leaves with smile.
	Hooson who leaves behind feels very embarrasses. It’s not good to explain to Jamie Moore, but it’s also not good to not explain to this to Jamie Moore. This feeling just like that he had admitted he is a gay. But who can prove that he is a normal man!
	...
	At the dinner table, Jamie Moore has prepared everything well. She can eat as soon as Ian Moore walks out. She feels very uncomfortable when she can’t eat the loving food cooked by Ian Moore.
	"Mommy, we can eat now." Ian Moore comes out with the soup and then he puts it on the table. His soft face is full of satisfaction. It seems that the unpleasant feeling that he was treated as a pillow by Wendy last night all disappears.
	"Honey, you are so kind." Jamie Moore kisses Ian Moore and leaves some saliva on his face, and then Jamie Moore begins to eat.
	Ian Moore’s face turns dark, and he looks at Jamie Moore with disgust. "It’s saliva, baby has a habit of cleanliness."
	Jamie Moore is chopped by a piece of eggplant which is put in her mouth just now. Ian Moore has no choice but to give a glass of water to her, and then he sits back to his own place.
	"Baby can't be fond of cleaning, or if mommy kisses you later, there is always saliva on your face.” Jamie Moore cries in his heart. Dan William is fond of cleaning, she never expects that her son is also fond of cleaning. How can she kiss her baby like that in the future?
	Ian Moore wrinkles his lovely little nose, and puts a chicken leg in the Jamie Moore’s bowl, "Mommy, you'd better kiss the chicken leg."
	"..."
	The atmosphere between Jamie Moore and Ian Moore is very good, but the atmosphere in the Moore Family is very bad. Celina Swift and Mia Moore sits on the soft with their hair in disorder, and their expensive clothes are all scratched by rats. Jack Moore is checking the things in Adele Gilbert’s room at the moment.
	...
	Celina Swift and Mia Moore sit on the sofa in still. They are afraid that Jack Moore will smash the mice to them later.
	"Bastard!" Jack Moore's angry voice comes from the second floor, which make Celina Swift and Mia Moore tremble. Mia Moore leans against Celina Swift and she is shivering. She is just frightened by the mouse, but now she still has to bear Jack Moore's anger. She is so scared that she wants to cry. However, now she looks very funny because her face is very dirty now.
	"I have told all of you that no one could enter that room. Who allows you to walk into that room?” Jack Moore walks upstairs with anger. The room of Adele Gilbert is in a mess, and the furniture is also scratched. Now he doesn’t know if something has missed in the room. Now the whole room is in a mess. How can he find any clues from the room?
	Celina Swift dares not say that it’s Jamie Moore who puts the mice into room, and her aim is to revenge them. Thus she could not say anything. Jack Moore is so angry that he even wants to beat her.
	"Dad, don't be angry. We'll go and get it right now." Mia Moore says pitifully.
	But it’s of no use at all. The resentment in her eyes is more than anything.
	She doesn’t understand why Jack Moore still keeps this thing since that woman has died for a long time. Is there still love between them?
	What Mia Moore hates most about Adele Gilbert and Jamie Moore is that since they have no relation with the Moore Family, but they are more threatening than before.
	"Get them at the right position? Shut up now! From now on, you two stay in the room. No one is allowed to come out without my permission!" Jack Moore leaves after finishing his words.
	Jack Moore walks into the room of Adele Gilbert. Seeing the mess in the room, he sighs. Then he walks out and goes to the study room.
	He turns on the computer and sends an overseas email quickly. But he doesn’t get a reply. Thus he turns off the computer, and leans on the chair without speaking.
	Chris Lockwood receives the email as soon as Jack Moore sends it. He copies it to Ian Moore immediately. At the moment, Jamie Moore and Ian Moore just took a bath. Ian Moore is forced to wear underwear with sponge baby on it by Jamie Moore, thus Ian Moore walks out with an embarrass expression.
	Jamie Moore walks out as she wipes her hair. She also wears pajamas with sponge baby on it. Most of her clothes are the same as Ian Moore’s. If Jamie Moore buys a lovely dress with a pattern printed on it, then Ian Moore will surely have the clothes with small size. This is the habit of them. If one of them has one thing, the other also needs to have one.
	Ian Moore walks out with two cups of milks in his hand. He hands one to Jamie Moore and then he walks to sit on the sofa. He turns on the laptop and then he receives the email sends by Chris Lockwood, and he opens it curiously.
	"Mommy, come here to see it. That old man has ideas on you.” Ian Moore waves to Jamie Moore. Looking at the contents of the email, Ian Moore’s eyes are full of anger.
	Jamie Moore walks to Ian Moore and looks at the email. There are only a few lines on it. The main idea is that the old man asks Chris Lockwood to persuade Jamie Moore to return the ring back. Otherwise, Chris Lockwood will suffer some bad things.
	Jack Moore is very good at calculating. He will never use that person until he must use him. At the critical moment, that person can bring the dying back to life. What's more, he wants to use Jamie Moore to find those people. His ambition is obvious.
	"He thinks too much." Jamie Moore sits on the sofa and takes a sip of milk. She doesn’t pay any attention to these words. As Chris Lockwood can't come to C country, Jack Moore also can't find Chris Lockwood, so Jack Moore can only find troubles with Jamie Moore.
Chapter 63 Can we discuss something?
	The next day, Jamie Moore goes to work as usual. Nana Banks feels better today, so she comes back to work today.
	Jamie Moore walks in front of two people who are looking at each other. Jamie Moore takes the design manuscript in her hands and she looks at them curiously for a few moments. Now the eyesight of them is different. Is it the so called love caused by illness?
	Jamie Moore denies this idea as soon as it appears in her mind. If love can be arose by this, Dan William, who is the same as the wood, will never cause any spark of love.
	No, it should be said that there is no love arose between Dan William and her. But as for Mia Moore, there should be love between them.
	Jamie Moore ignores Nana Banks and Adam Lee who are showing love to each other, and she walks out of the office. She never expects that she will meet Emily Lin, who has not make any trouble with her for several days. It seems that Emily Lin also does not expect to meet Jamie Moore. She is shocked for a while, and then she returns to normal quickly.
	Emily Lin touches her newly-made hair, and her body is full of the smell of perfume. And she still makes a heavy mark-up. But no matter how she puts on makeup, people still can see the thick black circles under her eyes.
	"It’s too terrible." It’s very strange, because Emily Lin doesn’t make a sarcastic remark to Jamie Moore. She just leaves a sentence--It’s terrible, and then she walks away.
	Jamie Moore blinks and then she touches her nose. It seems that she even can ward off evil spirits.
	In the office of the president, Jamie Moore walks in after knocking the door. The room is full of the smell of peppermint, which could wash the heavy perfume on Emily Lin’s body away immediately. Jamie Moore sniffs her nose and she smells carefully. Then she finds it’s the smell of Dan William’s body.
	Dan William stands in front of the huge glass window, and Jamie Moore can only see his back. It seems that he is talking with someone. He speaks in English. His voice is full of magnetic. He speaks English very well. Jamie Moore can understand what he says. After all, she is not the little girl who will have a headache when hearing English.
	And there will be on one who will say she is stupid on one hand, and translate it to her patiently on the other hand when she can understand the English she hears.
	Jamie Moore suddenly feels very cold. She puts the document down and she is prepared to leave. But she is called by Dan William, "Wait for a moment."
	Jamie Moore turns around. She sees that Dan William points at the sofa and orders her to sit there. Then Dan William turns around and continues to talk on the phone. Jamie Moore presses her lips and then she walks to sit on sofa.
	Five minutes later, Dan William hangs up. He walks to the sofa with the design manuscript in his hand. Then he sits on the sofa and looks at the design manuscript. He is just like a picture, and people will feel very happy when looks at him.
	"Have you prepared the design manuscript for the nomination meeting?" Dan William looks at these design manuscripts and then he asks unintentionally.
	"No." Jamie replies. Although there is no limit for the subject, content and requirements of the nomination meeting, it’s more difficult for this. What’s more, she does not know what to draw.
	Dan William looks at the design manuscript with appreciation. He knows that she is very talent in this aspect, but now he is surprised that she is much better than before.
	To be honest, none of the designers in this competition will be her opponent.
	After watching the design manuscript of her, people will never forget it. Other people can’t simulate the style of her.
	"I'll have a party later. You come with me!" Dan William orders and he doesn't give Jamie Moore any chance to refuse.
	After talking about business, it’s the time for having lunch, thus Dan William takes Jamie Moore to the restaurant opposite the company.
	"Mr. Dan. Can we discuss something?" Hearing that they have to have lunch on the 19th floor, Jamie Moore is very anxious.
	"No." Of course, Dan William knows what Jamie Moore is afraid of. But this time, he doesn't want her to be so afraid of heights. The most effective way is to attack poison with poison.
	Suddenly, Jamie Moore is more dizzy than before. Her hand becomes white and she doesn’t look well. But Dan William is determined to have lunch with her on the 19th floor at this time. Dan William will never give up even if she begs.
	"The floor is solid. Let's go." Dan William says. Then he takes her hand and walks into the elevator.
	Dan William holds her hand tightly after he feels the cold temperature from her hand. He takes her hand quietly. The reason he asks other people to change the solid floor here is that he wants to have lunch with her today. But he has to force her to go there. God knows the reason.
	Even though Jamie Moore doesn’t want, it’s her job after all. She knows that Dan William is strict with the ability and attitude of his staffs. This is the time to prove her ability. Moreover, even if she wants to go back now, she has no chance. The elevator has reached the 19th floor.
	"Hello, Mr. Dan. Please come with me." The waiter, who has been waiting by the elevator, reaches forward and says respectfully.
	Dan William nods, and he stills holds Jamie Moore’s hand in his hand.
	Jamie Moore relieves. She looks down at the floor. At least the floor isn't made of glass. As long as she doesn't look around, she will have no problem.
	The open-air restaurant is not on the top floor of Star, but it is located in a special position. It stretches across from the indoor restaurant. Originally, the floor and wall are all glass. No matter from which angle, you can enjoy a beautiful scene.
	However, in recent years, it’s been rectified by Dan William. So the floor turns into the white marble floor, and the wall is still made of glass, which does not affect the guests' mood of viewing.
	"Hello, Mr. Dan. This is my business card." The voice of the guest sounds familiar. Jamie Moore raises her head at once. She is shocked when she sees Hooson who is shaking hand with Dan William.
	Seeing Jamie Moore, Hooson is also surprised. He blinks his eyes and then he smiles at Jamie Moore, “Miss Jamie, Nice to meet you! It's the third time that we meet each other.”
	Seeing Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely, Dan William frowns. He is not very happy with Hooson’s words.
	"Do you know each other?" Dan William remembers Hooson. He has a deep impression on Hooson when he meets him in the entertainment club. But he never thinks that he would be his partner at this time.
	It seems that he is quite familiar with Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, "I've seen him twice and he even ask me to introduce a boyfriend to him."
	Hooson feels very embarrassed. When does he ask her to introduce a boyfriend to him? The truth is that she wants to introduce a boyfriend to him. And she even regards him as a gay!
	Dan William's face eases a little. He looks at Hooson with pity, which make Hooson feels more painful than before.
	The conversation starts. Jamie Moore has nothing to do, thus she pours water for them. Secretary Sam's information also comes into us. But Jamie Moore never expects that Hooson not only looks like her friend in temper, but also he is also allergic to seafood, which is the same as her friend. So there is no sea food on the table.
	"Jamie Moore, what’s the relationship between you and Mr. Dan?” Hooson asks suddenly when the conservation finishes. It seems that he is very interested in this question.
Chapter 64 Do you mind that I pursue Miss Jamie?
	Jamie Moore, who is looking at the phone, is shocked when the topic is converted to her suddenly, thus she smiles at Hooson officially. Hooson sits in a position where he can see the scenery outside the glass wall. Jamie Moore is very dizzy when she looks at Hooson. So she shakes her head to keep her mind clear, and then she says, "Mr. William is my boss, and I’m his staff."
	Dan William wants to add something, but he suddenly feels pain on his feet. He turns around and then he finds Jamie Moore stares at him fiercely. It seems that she is saying if you dare to say anything, I'll throw you down from here.
	Dan William narrows his eyes. He glances at Hooson and then his eyes focus on Jamie Moore. No one could know what he is thinking.
	Hooson nods, and the smile on his face become more and more bigger. “In that case, Mr. Dan, If I pursue Miss Jamie, do you mind it?”
	What? Jamie Moore is shocked. Is Hooson kidding with her? Does Hooson want to steal Dan William’s girlfriend?
	It should be said that Jamie Moore’s IQ really needs to be supplemented.
	The atmosphere around Dan William cools down suddenly, and people around him even feel cold. His dark eyes are as cold as ice. He plays with the crystal clasp on his cuff and then he glances at Hooson casually, "Hooson, you always like making joke with others."
	Hooson becomes serious, but he still keeps smile. He focuses his eyes on Jamie Moore, “I’m not kidding with you. Miss Jamie does have a special charm, which attracts me. If Mr. William is willing to introduce Miss Jamie to me, I’m willing to give the best interests to Mr. William."
	Jamie Moore shivers her body. She could obviously feel that the temperature around Dan William is colder than before. The cool momentum on his body made other people feel submissive from the bottom of their hearts. But he is still smiling, and his smile is indifferent and dignified. He doesn't pay any attention to Hooson.
	"I'm sorry. If Mr. Hooson is really alone and empty, I can introduce some good-looking guys to you. But you should not have ideas on my man. It’s better for us to cancel this cooperation.” Dan William stands up and says coldly, and then he holds Jamie Moore’s hand and walks out.
	Hooson is slightly stunned. Although he is smiling, the face is colder than before. “Mr. William, you know the value of this cooperation case better, don't you think about it more?"
	"I never pay any attention to this money. She belongs to me. Do you want to take her away with such a bad case?" Dan William looks at Hooson ironically and then he pulls Jamie Moore out of the open-air restaurant.
	A bad case?
	This case is worth more than 100 million yuan. He is too headstrong!
	However, is this more interesting? Hooson smiles strangely suddenly, which makes people unable to understand.
	After walking out of the elevator, Dan William does not return back to the car with Jamie Moore. Instead, he holds Jamie Moore’s hand and walks on the street with her in a bad mood. At this moment, it's just over eight o'clock. There are many people in the street, and most of them are lovers, and they are very sweet with their lovers. Single man and woman will be hurt by this surly.
	Jamie Moore’s face is still red, because Dan William says that she is his woman. Now she is like a ripe peach which will lure other people. Her heart beats like a rabbit, and her heart keeps jumping all the time.
	Just now, she’s worried that Dan William will agree to send her to Hooson like an object. But her heart returns to normal after hearing Dan William’s words.
	Ah. Jamie Moore takes a deep breath. Dan William grabs her wrist hardly. She feels very pain, thus she frowns. Her twist must turn red now.
	"Dan William, you hurt me." Jamie Moore says softly. She could feel the anger in his heart. So she says in a good tone, and she does not lose her temper for pain.
	Hearing these words, Dan William stops suddenly. Jamie Moore is pulled to the front of Dan William. She is forced to look with Dan William, “So, are you regret that you come out with me without agreeing Hooson’s pursuit?"
	Jamie Moore is shocked, and she blinks her eyes, and then nods.
	"Are you a fool? Don’t you get angry when he treats you as an object?" Dan William looks at her coldly. Then he loosens his hand which is put on Jamie Moore’s shoulder. Then he turns away after glancing at Jamie. He does all of this quickly, and Jamie Moore even doesn’t have time to stop him. She can just see that the figure of Dan William walks away.
	The feeling of sad rises from her heart. She is leaves behind again
	Jamie Moore really hates this feeling. Her mother leaves in such way, and her mother even leaves without looking back, and then never appears in her life.
	She sniffs her noses, and walks forward in a bad mood. She walks on the streets like a cat that is abandoned by its host.
	Jamie Moore holds her arm tightly when the night wind blows on her body. So she rubs her nose, and then a suit coat is put on her shoulder. She turns around. The surprise in her heart disappears when she sees the face of Hooson.
	"It's you." Jamie Moore presses her lips. But now she doesn’t know how to smile, though she is always good at smiling officially.
	Hooson puts his coat on the shoulder of Jamie Moore. He only wears a white shirt inside. It’s very clean and warm. Then he says with smile on his face, "I'm sorry just now, I never treat you as a commodity."
	"It doesn't matter. We're not familiar with each other. I don’t care what you say." Jamie Moore shakes her head. She really doesn’t mind it, because she is not familiar with Hooson.
	Hooson sighs slightly, and then he says that you are the same as before.
	"What are you saying?" Jamie Moore doesn’t hear him clearly, thus she looks at him doubtfully.
	Hooson shakes her head, "No. But I really want to pursue you, don't you think about it? You may never find such a good man like me.”
	"Sorry, I'm not interested in gay." Jamie Moore takes his coat off and throws the coat to him quickly, and then she stays away from Hooson.
	“I have told you that I’m not a gay…” Hooson takes over his coat, and then he shakes his head helplessly. He walks toward Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore keeps away from him.
	Jamie Moore walks almost in the middle of the street. Then she steps on an empty accidentally.
	Hooson is shocked and he wants to pull Jamie Moore. But another man holds Jamie Moore quickly. The man holds Jamie Moore and brings Jamie to his arms. His action is full of momentum, and no one could ignore him.
	"Mr. William, what’s a coincidence! We meet each other again.” Hooson narrows his amber eyes. Usually no one could see his amber eyes. But under the street lamp, his amber eyes are very obvious, and everyone could see it clearly.
	Dan William doesn’t answer him, and then he walks away with his hands on Jamie Moore’s waist.
	After the last time, he would never leave Jamie Moore alone. Thus he returns back when he has gone about half way. Then he saw that dangerous scene. She is such a stupid woman. Will she suffer dangerous when she leaves him?
	She really can’t do anything when she leaves him. She is so stupid!
	"Haven’t you gone?" Dan William takes Jamie Moore to the parking lot, and then Dan William puts her in into the passenger seat. His face is as dark as before. Her voice is a little timid when she asks, as if she is afraid that he would get angry again.
	
Chapter 65 How can't I do this?
	Seeing Jamie Moore’s lovely appearance, Dan William would not get angry anymore. He hums, and then sits on the driver’s seat. Then he starts the engine and leaves the parking lot.
	"Hello, I'm not familiar with him. What should I get angry?" Seeing that Dan William doesn’t say anything, but his expression eased a little, Jamie Moore stares at him and says.
	Dan William doesn’t answer her, and he even does not look at her.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she continues to say, “If the cooperation case is cancelled for this, don’t you feel it’s a pity? Do I need to contact with him again?"
	Dan Willian still ignores her. He makes a turn calmly, but his eyes still focus on the front.
	"Hey, Dan William, why do you get angry so easily like an old woman? It's not you that who are regarded as a commodity." Jamie is very angry now, and she is speechless about Dan William's haughty appearance. She doesn't owe him any money. Instead, he has to pay her every month. When it comes angry, it should be her to get angry.
	"Stop now. I'll find Hooson now and I will accept his pursuit." Jamie Moore stares at him. It seems that she will jump out of the car if Dan William doesn’t stop.
	Does he think that she had lost all her temper?
	Dan William finally has a reaction, and then he stares at Jamie Moore. His eyes are full of warning, "Are you sure!"
	"I’m sure, how can’t I do this?" Jamie Moore stares back.
	Dan William presses his lips. He touches his neck in a strange way.
	When Jamie Moore calms down, she finds she has made some mistakes. Thus she shrinks her neck and looks at Dan William who has a dark face. Then she says, “Hey, thank you just now."
	Dan William hums. He knows that she thanks him for helping her in the open-air restaurant, not for pulling her on the street right now.
	If that man is an ordinary man, Dan William will not have such a big action. But he feels that Hooson is not like a normal person. This is a man's natural instinct. His words seem to be true, and he is not joking with Jamie Moore.
	"You should not see him in the future."
	Dan William receives a call from Bruce Hill after he sends Jamie Moore to the restaurant, “Brother, why do you cancel this cooperation case so easily? Can you stop being so headstrong?"
	It’s a big cooperation case of 100 million. Will you give it up?
	"Um? If you want it, I could send it to you.” Dan William says coldly. Let alone it’s a cooperation case, he will never cooperate with that company in the future.
	"Don’t patronize me! What I mind is that why do you give up that case?"
	Dan William keeps silent for a while, and then he says calmly, “When you should make a choice between the cooperation case and woman you loved, what’s your choice?”
	Dan William hangs up after saying these words. Bruce Hill is shocked. What’s the meaning of choosing from the cooperation case and the woman you love?
	"Bruce, do you understand the meaning of our brother?" Bruce Hill asks. He doesn’t understand what’s the conflict between the cooperation case and the woman you love?
	Duke Field is smarter than Bruce Hill. He suddenly realizes that the woman in Dan William’s mouth refers to Jamie Moore.
	"It seems that the partner has offended Jamie Moore." Duke Field says with hands on his chin, “Don’t you know our brother like to protect people around him?"
	It’s obvious that Dan William like to protect people around him. He even protects Bruce Hill and Duke Filed. But when it comes to Jamie Moore, Dan William will ignore them!
	"Do you think will our brother marry Jamie Moore?"
	Duke Filed shakes his head, "Who can guess the mind of our brother?"
	No one can force Dan William. They are very curious that who will get the position of Mrs. William in the end.
	Dan William drives the car back to the manor. Seeing that Dan William comes back, Cindy Swift walks forward, “Young master, do you need to eat something?"
	Dan William nods. Then he puts his suit to Cindy Swift, and then she goes upstairs.
	“Derek William.” Dan William asks when he walks into the room.
	“Young master.”
	"I want all the information about this man." Dan William throws the business card of Hooson on the desk with deep eyes.
	"Yes." Derek William picks up the business card on the desk. He remembers the name in the heart. Then he walks into the dark and only Dan William stays in the room.
	The book under his hand is a little old, and there is a picture under it.
	It’s noon again, Jamie Moore doesn’t forget the appointment with Dan William. She puts the semi-finished design draft into the drawer, and then she packs the things on the table. Jamie Moore doesn’t notice the time when Nana Banks and Adam Lee leaves.
	A figure walks into the office of Jamie Moore after Jamie Moore leaves. The man walks to the Jamie Moore’s seat. After a while, she finds several pieces of paper, which is Jamie Moore’s design draft.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t know the design draft, which she spends the whole morning to finish, has been taken away by others. At the moment, she is walking to the Star hotel.
	Jamie Moore walks to the door of the Star hotel. And she is pushed to the side by a big push when she is about to walks into the hotel. Then she smells a strong perfume. Then her whole body returns back uncontrollably. Suddenly, someone holds her back steadily, so that she does not bump into the glass behind.
	"What a coincidence! We meet each other again." The soft voice sounds from the ear. Jamie Moore turns around, and then she sees the big face of Hooson, thus she takes a few step back immediately.
	"Aren't you a stalker?" Jamie Moore presses her lips. She glances at Hooson. Even though they have such a fate, they will not meet each other again and again. And he even meets her in the every time that she leaves alone.
	The smile on Hooson’s lips becomes stiff. From the moment he sees Jamie Moore to now, he has doubts that there is something on his face for several times. At the beginning, she said he is a gay. And now, she says he is a stalker. He feels very embarrasses..
	"Haha, brother, you also have such a time." Anna Pork looks at Jamie Moore with a smile from the back of Hooson, "You're Jamie Moore, aren't you? My brother mentions you to me. My name is Anna Pork." Anna Pork introduces herself to Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore really has a deep impression on Anna Pork. She is really brave, and she dares to beat Bruce Hill so heavily. Thus she shakes hand with Anna Pork, and says with a smile, ‘Hello.”
	"Sister Jamie Moore, my brother wants to pursue you. Do you agree?" It’s seems that Anna Pork is very familiar with her. After shaking her hand with Jamie Moore, she holds Jamie Moore's arm affectionately and blinks at Hooson.
	Hooson looks at Anna in a warning way, and he doesn’t say anything.
	"Am I like someone who has no brain at all?" Jamie Moore glances at Hooson and then she smiles at Anna Pork, "Now I have something to do, so we can chat with each other one day."
	"Are you going to have lunch?"
	Jamie Moore nods, “Someone is waiting for me.”
	This time, what Dan William chose is not the box, but the restaurant. Bruce Hill and Duke Filed are also there.
	"Here, Jamie Moore." There is no one but Bruce Hill who will call Jamie Moore in such a loud way. Dan William and Duke Filed are used to it, thus they just turns around without saying anything.
	Seeing that people at the restaurant all looks at her, Jamie Moore bows her head quickly. She walks to the front of them. The seat is four people. Only the seat beside Dan William is empty. So Jamie Moore sits down naturally.
	
Chapter66 I have no interested in gay
	"Honey” When Jamie Moore just sits down, a sweet voice sounds. Jamie Moore looks up in surprise. Then she sees a woman who wears high-heeled shoes walks to their desk. The woman has an exquisite makeup on her face, thus she looks more beautiful and bright. She has a dedicate eye and brow, and she lips are painted with lipstick, and all is a fatal attraction to other people. Jamie Moore also walks in Cr for a long time, thus she knows that woman.
	"Mr. Hill and Mr. Filed, you two are also here."
	It’s July Summer, who is the chief model of Cr. She is a woman who is loved by thousands of people in the modeling world.
	She has no backstage at all. She reaches such position for her face, figure and efforts, which surprises all other people.
	But July Summer knows everything well. It’s Dan William who helps her to reach such position.
	"Excuse me, Miss. This is my place." July Summer blinks at Jamie Moore. She doesn’t have any hostility or jealousy to Jamie Moore. When she sees Jamie Moore, her eyes even flashes a touch of amazement and surprise. She is selected as the chief model of Cr by Dan William after Jamie Moore leaves, so she doesn’t know the thing happened to them in the past. It’s normal that she doesn’t know Jamie Moore.
	It’s Dan William who gives success to July Summer, but what’s more, it’s July Summer’s efforts that make herself to reach the success. What’s more, she doesn’t like other woman who will pester Dan William, thus Dan William treats her very well. So he doesn’t pay any attention to the name that July Summer calls him.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. When she smells the smell of the heavy presume, she sudden remind of everything. She is that person who almost pushes her down on the door. But what does she mean by saying that this is her position?
	Seeing that Dan Willian doesn’t plan to explain the thing, Bruce Hill and Duke Filed turns around..
	Seeing that Dan William, who sits beside her, keeps silent with a cup of coffee in his hand, Jamie Moore frowns. She feels very uncomfortable as if the needle is stabbing her.
	Tut, this feeling is very bad, and it just like that she is shameless women who will pester Dan William.
	"I'm sorry." Since Dan William doesn’t say anything, this means he agrees to July Summer’s words. So she has nothing to say. It's just a place. She can order another table.
	About eating, Jamie Moore really has a lot of experience. That is, eating without noticing other people’s eyes.
	"Wait." Dan William says in the cold voice. Jamie Moore and July Summer all looks at Dan William, but Dan William looks at Jamie Moore and says, "We have something to do now. Please wait for us elsewhere."
	If Dan William doesn’t say anything, Jamie Moore’s mood will be much better than now. But now hearing his word, Jamie Moore suddenly feels that she is humiliated By Dan William. It seems that she wants to pester him. Is that her? Is that her?
	July Summer looks at Jamie Moore strangely, and then she looks at Dan William. Do they know each other?
	Jamie Moore raises her chin proudly, and then she smiles officially, "No, you can enjoy it.
	Oh?
	Hearing Jamie Moore’s word, July Summer looks at her with appreciation. Anyone will feel uncomfortable when he hears Dan William’s words. But this girl is quite funny. She doesn’t quarrel with anyone, and she even smiles. It's rare.
	Jamie Moore turns around and leaves, and she even proud herself in her heart. Dan William's words can’t be taken seriously. His word is just like the story of the wolf. After this, she decides that she will never pay attention to the agreement with him.
	A figure rushes to her when she just takes a few steps. Jamie Moore is so fright that she takes a few steps back. She relieves when she finds that figure is Anna Pork.
	"Sister Jamie Moore, have you eaten lunch? We are about to have lunch. Do you want to have lunch with us?" Now Anna Pork is different from the fierce and domineering image on that day, and she looks at Jamie Moore expectantly. If Anna Pork has a tail behind her, she will wag the tail happily.
	Bruce Hill Pork and Duke Filed all look at Jamie Moore when they hear the noise. Dan William will see all of this as long as he looks up. Seeing that Jamie Moore is hugged by Anna Pork, his eyes are full of displeasure.
	Jamie Moore also aware the warning eyes of Dan William. But she has to have lunch, so she can eat with anyone, and all is the same. Then Jamie Moore nods, “Ok.”
	Hooson cheers and then she takes Jamie Moore to the position. Seeing that Anna Pork pulls Jamie Moore to their desk, Hooson is surprised. Then he smiles at Jamie Moore, “Look, what a coincidence. I’m not a stalker."
	Their seat is in front of Dan William. Anna Pork puts Jamie Moore to the seat beside Hooson. Jamie Moore only treats her as a child, so she doesn’t refuse it.
	Dan William holds the coffee cup in his hand tightly and he doesn’t say anything. But everyone will feel fright when they see the dark face of Dan William.
	"July, do you have any harvest this time? Have you found those people?" Duke Filed looks around and then asks.
	July Summer puts the knife and fork that she just picks up down, and then she shakes the red wine glass at hand, and says, “No, I can’t find them.”
	"Well, they really know how to hide themselves. We haven't found them since we look for them for so long time." Bruce Hill presses his lips and then says.
	"We have no chance to find them since we don’t have secret ring. Now we don’t have any clue. What do you expect?" Duke Filed rolls his eyes.
	"What will we do if we find secret ring? Maybe none of them exist. Even if we find them, it's a waste of effort." Bruce Hill pulls down the shirt that hurt his neck, and then he unties two buttons, and then everyone can see his strong chest. It seems that he often exercises.
	The atmosphere on the dining table returns to silence again. July Summer looks at the man beside her. She feels a little uncomfortable in her heart. She turns her eyes around quickly, and says unconsciously, "I'm not going to go back to France this time. Besides, there's no business for me in France. Honey, won't you rush me back?
	Dan William doesn’t answer. He takes a sip of coffee and then nods lightly.
	July Summer feels very happy in her heart, and she smiles sweetly.
	"What are you afraid of? You may be my sister-in-law in the future." Anna Pork's joking words fall into the ears of four people, and then Dan William hold his hand tightly.
	Bruce Hill rakes his hair, and then he frowns, "Why does he think this sound is so familiar?"
	"Don't talk nonsense. I'm not interested in gay." Jamie Moore says as she drinks juice in the cup. She still feels hungry. As Ian Moore says, it’s not a good way to eat at such a high-level restaurant which only put a little food on a large plate. This is absolutely a way to abuse one’s stomach.
	In fact, Jamie Moore is not a foodie from the beginning, but she is fed by Ian Moore. He doesn’t have a high demand for food and she doesn’t eat so much. Now, she becomes a foodie. Is that her fault?
	
Chapter 67 Marry her
	Jamie Moore often says to Ian Moore when Ian Moore looks at her in ashamed way. It's a blessing to eat delicious food.
	Then Ian Moore adds quickly. If you eat more, you will become pig…
	Gay? Anna is shocked. She looks at Hooson in a surprise way, and then she says, “Brother, the reason why you don’t have a girlfriend is…”
	"Who tell this to you? The reason I don’t have a girlfriend is that I know Jamie Moore will appear in my life, and I’m waiting for her."
	Hooson throws the question to Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore ignores.
	"Jamie Moore, my elder brother is so handsome. In fact, he can do everything. If you marry him later, he can do all housework. You will never find such a good man if you miss.” Anna Pork is trying to introduce his brother to Jamie Moore. Even her words are 99% similar to Hooson's.
	"Don't you know that there's a kind of people called hourly workers?" Jamie Moore looks at her with her chopsticks. She doesn't understand why Hooson and Anna Pork all try to introduce Hooson to her. Does Hooson really want to marry others?
	After eating, Jamie Moore even feels that there is something with her ears.
	Anna Pork’s expression becomes stiff. She turns to look at Hooson, and it seems that she is asking what does an hourly employee mean? She looks very cute.
	"I remember!" Bruce Hill stands up suddenly and then he looks at Anna Pork, "Dead woman!" He walks forward and walks to the desk of Jamie Moore.
	"Pervert! You are everywhere. Where are you going to hold the pillar this time?" Anna Pork raises her eyes, and then she looks at Bruce Hill provocatively. Now she is very different from what she looks in front of Jamie Moore.
	"Dead Woman, can you say something good?” Bruce Hill stares at Anna Pork. As the saying goes, little mistakes lead to big ones. He is just like this saying. Once you are guilty, you will always guilty.
	"Do I have anything to do with you? Dead woman? Are you calling me? Do you dare to go out and fight with me alone?" Anna Pork stares back and then she raises her fist.
	Bruce Hill sneers, “Fight? I never beat woman. You are so lucky! Follow with me!”
	"Dead pervert! Don't pull me with your hand! Let me go!" After all, Anna Pork’s strength is smaller than Bruce Hill, thus she is pulled out by Bruce Hill. Anna Pork roars all the way, thus all people looks at her.
	"Pervert? If you continue to roar, I'll let you know what a real pervert is! Do you believe?" Bruce Hill pulls Anna Pork out and warns her fiercely.
	"Is your sister really OK?" Jamie Moore turns around and looks at Hooson. As for Bruce Hill’s nature, even though he doesn’t beat Anna Pork, he still has way to deal with her.
	Hooson smiles, and it seems that he is not worried at all. "Anna will be OK, but maybe your friend will suffer some troubles."
	Jamie Moore reminds the scene in the entertainment club that day. If Bruce Hill can win, it will be Anna Pork who gives in to him.
	Tut Tut, it's really the destruction of image.
	"Well, don't worry about them. What else do you want to eat? You eat so little right now." Hooson is very careful. Seeing that Jamie Moore eats very little, he asks.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she smiles, “No, I'm full."
	"Wait a minute, there is something on your face." Hooson says suddenly. He reaches out to touch Jamie Moore’s face. But he looks at the direction of Dan William, and then he smiles. He touches Jamie Moore’s face slowly.
	From Dan William’s direction, it seems that they are kissing with each other.
	Click.
	It’s the break sound of the glass.
	"Ah, honey, your hand!" Jamie Moore looks at July Summer and Dan William subconsciously. She sees that July Summer holds Dan William’s wrist nervously and exhales on it. Dan William does not wave her hand away and he even does not refuse her.
	But he stares at the position of Jamie Moore. His eyes are as dark as the bottom of the sea, and his eyes even give others a feeling of chilling.
	But there is a kind of person has such ability. Even he does not doing anything, his eyesight will make your heart tremble.
	Jamie Moore is very familiar with Dan William’s angry expression, thus her temple rises suddenly. Even if there is someone who needs to get angry, that person should be her. He hugs such a beautiful woman, and he eats with such a good mood. Why does he get angry?
	Jamie Moore humps, and then she turns around. She picks her fork up and pokes at the half eaten mousse cake in front of her.
	Hooson blinks his eyes, and then he looks at the position of Dan William. Their eyes cross in the air. For a moment, Hooson presses his lips and then he throws the challenging eyesight to Dan William.
	Dan William's hand is still bleeding. He smiles when he receives Hooson's challenging eyes. His smile is cold, which just like the weather in December. If the smile is more colder, it will freeze.
	He stands up suddenly, which surprises July Summer who was dressing him up. July Summer finds Dan William walks to the position of Jamie Moore directly.
	"Follow me." Dan William stops in front of Jamie Moore, and then he orders.
	Jamie Moore glances at him, and then she presses her lips. She says in a resistance way, “It's not work time now. How can Dan William limit the free time of employees?"
	All right. It’s resistance.
	Jamie Moore also has her own temper, and sometimes she is not obedient. Now Dan William is just her boss, so she does not need to do anything to please him. What’s more, he owes her more.
	"Don't let me say it for second time." Dan William’s voice becomes cold. He narrows his eyes and he keeps his hands around his chest.
	Hooson frowns, and he looks at Dan William with a hint of disapproval, “Mr. William, even though you the boss of Jamie Moore, you can’t limit the free time of her. Jamie Moore has the right to choose leave or not.
	Jamie Moore looks at him with different eyes as soon as he finishes his word. Well, it should be said that now Jamie Moore doesn’t treat him as a gay.
	Hooson is so excited. He can finally get rid of the damn name of gay!
	Jamie?
	Dan William glances at Hooson coldly. How can he call Jamie?
	"You will have 30 seconds to think about it. If you don’t answer me within the time, all the previous bonuses will be deducted." Dan William says softly in Jamie Moore’s ears, and he turns away.
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely. How could he do this again?
	"I'm sorry. I need to go now and I will treat you some other day." Jamie Moore picks her bag up and follows Dan William quickly.
	Every second is money!
	Hooson is shocked. How can she go just like this?
	July Summer also feels confuse. She has never seen Dan William show that expression before. She turns to look at Duke Filed and asks, "Who is this girl? It seems that Dan cares about her."
	Duke Filed looks at her, and then he lowers his head to play his phone again, “You just need to know that she is the one you can't provoke."
	
Chapter 68 Design drafts are missing
	She is a woman that she can’t provoke? After hearing this, July Summer smiles suddenly. It sounds that this is very dangerous. But she is not afraid of it.
	She would like to know the relationship between Dan William and this girl. Why can’t she make troubles with this girl?
	Jamie Moore runs to catch up with Dan William. She holds her hands on her waist, and she gasps. That's enough. He threats her with the bonus every time. He is sure that she will come out in this way.
	"Mr. William, since you are so bored, you should go back and look at the documents. There is no need to worry about the personal affairs of your staffs."
	"I remember I have told you clearly yesterday. You are not allowed to meet him in the future. Do you take my words aside?" Dan William puts his hands in his pockets and then he looks at Jamie Moore with threatening eyes. He is very domineering.
	But Dan William is always such a person. No one could refute his words even though five years have passed. Sometimes, he is very unreasonable. Even though he has the capital, he can’t do this.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. He seems to tell these words to her before. But she never takes these words seriously, and she just puts these words aside...
	"Um?" Dan William approaches to her. He puts his fingers on Jamie Moore’s lips, and he rubs them back and forth. She even could see her body in his eyes, “Does he kiss you here?"
	Although Dam William sees that scene just now, he believes Jamie Moore. Even though he is very angry, he will not believe that she is kissed by Hooson. If this is true, Jamie Moore will slap Hooson immediately, and she will not be so calm.
	What's more, Hooson has determined to declare war on him officially. Anyway, he has to do something back.
	Jamie Moore wants to explain this, but Dan William raises her chin slightly. Then he kisses her, and his lips are very hot. This kiss is just like the last one, which is full of punishment
	After kissing, Dan William sees the dim figure hidden beside the door, and then he smiles, “It seems that you never remember this. Remember, I’m the only one who could touch here. Do you understand?"
	"Dan William, do you know that you control too much?” Jamie Moore stares at him, and her face is very red. She doesn’t know Dan William’s mind at all. Thus she presses her lips angrily.
	He kisses her when he wants to do this. What does he think of her?
	If Jamie Moore has the courage, she will kiss Dan William hardly. He should know the feeling of forcing other people.
	However, anywhere, Dan William is the beneficiary, right?
	"If you have opinion, you can bite me.” Dan William looks at Jamie Moore. She doesn’t know how beautiful she is. It seems that she is angry, but she is very charming now. She is as cute as a lazy cat.
	So what is Dan William doing? Does he tease the cat?
	"I’ll bite you, and I bite you!" Jamie Moore holds Dan William’s hand and then she bites on it. She bites hardly, thus Dan William’s face almost changes for pain.
	He is just teasing her, and he never expects that she really does this!
	When Jamie Moore returns back to the office, it’s only 1:30. It still leaves half an hour. Jamie Moore stretches herself, and then she prepares to start work. But she can’t find the design draft.
	“Have I thrown the design draft?” Jamie Moore frowns. She looks for the design draft in the drawer. Although it’s only a semi-finished product, she still has the chance to win if she participate the competition with this. She spends all the morning to draw this. It's a pity if the design draft disappears.
	"Jamie Moore, what are you looking for?" Nana Banks comes in, and Adam Lee follows behind her. Seeing that Jamie Moore is looking for something, she asks curiously.
	"Design draft. I can’t find my design draft which is used to participate the nomination meeting." Jamie Moore looks for it carefully, and she dares not to miss something.
	"Really? You should look for it carefully. Have you thrown the design draft accidentally?" Nana Banks puts her bag down and then she helps Jamie Moore to find it. Then she reminds of something suddenly, and then she says, "Isn't there a surveillance video here? Adam Lee, you transfer the video here, and we want to look at it."
	"In order to ensure that the works are not copied, the surveillance video of the designer's office has been stopped." Adam Lee says.
	Nana Banks is completely discouraged. She feels hopeless when she sees Jamie Moore does not find anything, and then she says, "Jamie Moore, what are you going to do? The nomination meeting is coming, and you do not have enough time to prepare it."
	Jamie Moore sits back on her chair, and then she shrugs her shoulder nonchalantly, "I'll draw another one. It's not too hard for me."
	She just needs to draw that picture again.
	But now, Jamie Moore does not want to draw that again, and she wants to draw another picture.
	…
	"Mommy, why don't you draw the baby? I’m so cute. If you draw me, you will win." Ian Moore blinks at Jamie Moore, and then he looks at Jamie Moore who has been thinking for an hour.
	Jamie Moore moves Ian Moore's small head to one side gently, and then says, "Honey, although Mommy wants to show you to others how cute the baby is, Mommy’s company doesn't sell children's clothes."
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and he holds Jamie Moore’s neck. His smart face is full of smile, and then he says, “Mommy, I want to ask you a question.”
	"Well." Jamie Moore yawns and then she nods.
	"If the design draft and I fall into the water at the same time, which one would Mommy save?"
	How could he ask her such question?
	"Honey, where do you get such a classic question? Ok. Now I want to ask you a question. If Mommy and your laptop fell into the water at the same time, who would you save first? Jamie Moore puts the pen down, and then she asks.
	Ian Moore thinks for a while, and then he says, “But I can’t swim.”
	He is only four years old, and Jamie Moore also has no time to take him to learn it.
	"Then if you can swim, what will you do?"
	If I could swim…Ian Moore thinks for a while, and then he looks at Jamie Moore with a disdainful face, "Mommy, you even can't swim, and you are so stupid.
	Jamie Moore sniffs her nose. Well, Ian Moore disgusts me again.
	Ian Moore stands up, and then he runs into the room. He locks the door and then he takes his laptop. Then he sends a message to Dan William's account.
	"Handsome man, handsome man, I’m calling you.” Ian Moore beats on the key board.
	Dan William sends s cold expression, following by a question mark.
	Ian Moore smiles, “If the woman you loved and one important thing of you fall into the water at the same time, which one will you save first?”
	As soon as Dan William walks out of the bathroom, He receives the message from Ian Moore. The portrait of Ian Moore is a round bun, which make Dan William smile.
	No, why does he have his account number?
	"Who are you? Why do you have my account?"
	Ian Moore is shocked when he receives the message from Dan William. Seeing that Dan William forgets him, Ian Moore is not satisfied with this. Thus he sends a rolling expression, "I'm Ian Moore, handsome man."
	Dan William suddenly reminds that it’s the boy in the cake shop.
	
Chapter69 Maybe you are my father
	"It's so easy to get your account. I'm Ian Moore." When Dan William is thinking of the question, Ian Moore sends this message to him, following by a lovely picture of little gourd.
	Dan William still remembers this gourd. The hacker who invaded his computer that day also planted many gourds in his computer.
	The gourd is purple, white and round.
	The hacker runs away after he plants the gourd. Even he doesn’t catch this bold hacker.
	But Dan William never expects that the bold hacker now is asking him such a question—If the woman you loved and the thing you loved fall into the water at the same time, who would you save at first?
	“Handsome man, please answer me quickly.”
	"The textbooks of kindergarten even teach this kind of thing to the child." Dan William puts the white towel aside and then he answers the question quickly, but he doesn’t answer the question in a positive way.
	If the woman he loved and the thing he loved fall into the water at the same time, who would he save at first? About this question, Dan William never thinks about it.
	It doesn't matter if things are gone, but there is only one woman he loved in the world. Even though the thing is expensive, but it’s just a thing.
	“I saw this question on TV.” Ian Moore replies with shame. The children in the kindergarten even don’t know these words. They may only know the two simplest words in this question. Of course, he is not a normal child. Otherwise, how could he play the computer so well?
	Ian Moore praises himself in his heart.
	"How can the woman he loved not swim?" Dan William sneers. But he suddenly reminds that Jamie Moore really can’t swim after saying these words. Even if she can swim, she will only know a little.
	"Who is your favorite woman?" Ian Moore asks after thinking for a while. He remembers that his mother can’t swim. So who is his favorite woman? Does he have another lover?
	"You are a little child, and you don’t need to know this.” Dan William sneers. It’s doesn’t matter. Even if Jamie Moore doesn’t know how to swim, he can teach her one day. He is sure that she will know how to swim in the future.
	"What's the matter? Can’t the little child know this?" Ian Moore hums. He sends a picture with little grimace gourd to Dan William, and then he closes the dialogue with Dan William. Then he starts to search the information about Dan William on the internet.
	At last, he really finds a picture of Dan William. In that picture, a woman is binding up the wound for Dan William’s hand. The page is very large, which occupies half of the web page. The page even uses red font to indicate the identity of that woman. That woman is July Summer, who is the chief model of Cr group. And that woman just comes from France. It’s seems that she is Dan William’s another lovers.
	Ian Moore smiles after seeing these words. There are so many people love his daddy. Mia Moore is a woman who loves his daddy, and July Summer is another woman who loves his daddy.
	Does the god think he and his mother are too relaxed? So the God is finding things for them.
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and then he sends the screenshot of the photo to Dan William. He even sends a message to him, “Handsome man, this man looks like you."
	Although it's just a profile of Dan William, one could see the face of Dan William and July Summer clearly. If you know Dan William, you will sure know the man in the picture at the first sight.
	Dan William is shocked when he sees the picture. The picture is taken from the side. It's very beautiful. It seems that the man and woman on the picture are the true lovers. But Dan William’s mood also drops to the freezing point for this.
	"Where are the pictures from?"
	"Wow, it's really you." Ian Moore sends an expression of rolling eyes to Dan William.
	Ian Moore continues to sends the message, “Does this model is the woman you loved?”
	Dan William’s answer should be no. Otherwise, Ian Moore will put Dan William to the blacklist. And then he will kick him out of his heart!
	"It’s impossible. She's just a model for our company." Dan William does not want Ian Moore misunderstand him, thus he types quickly to answer Ian Moore’s question.
	Even Dan William is shocked by this idea.
	Why does he care so much about the idea of a little boy?
	He reminds the cute and smart face of Ian Moore, and then he feels soft in his heart. Even his eyesight becomes warm. But then he reminds of something suddenly, and his eyesight becomes dark.
	Ian Moore hums. It’s very good, and he wants to give him ten points!
	"Handsome man, we look like each other. Maybe you are my father." Ian Moore sneers. Dan William will be shocked after hearing this, is he right?
	Dan William just thinks that Ian Moore is joking with him. So he doesn’t care about this, and then he says, “Little boy, if you father hear this, he will beat you.”
	"Handsome man, you are so violent." Ian Moore laughs. If Dan William really knows the meaning of these words, Ian Moor will be very happy though he is beaten by him.
	“Young master, Hooson's information is here." Derek William knocks on the door and then comes in. He puts several pieces of paper in front of Dan William. His breath is as cold as ever.
	Dan William sends the message—I will log off to Ian Moore after looking the paper on the desk, and then he closes the computer. Then he picks the paper up and looks at it.
	Hooson is a male, and he is twenty five years old. He is the successor of Hooson's group. He has a little sister. He lived in the UK since he born. He returns to the China in recent days, and he is general manager of Hooson’s Group…
	"Do we only have this information?" Dan William looks at a few pieces of information, and he frowns. He feels very strange, because the information is too concise and deliberate.
	"Yes, I can only find this. His information in the UK is also blank, and I could only find some basic information." Derek William answers. As long as the person had existed in the world, he would find some clues. Not only Hooson’s information is empty, but also the life experience of Hooson in the UK is vacant. This means that he does not want others know more information about him.
	Maybe this identity is also a fake one.
	"Continue." Dan William puts down the paper in his hand. Then he lowers his head, and no one could know his thinking.
	"Yes." Derek William bows his head and replies. The black clothes on his body are the best cover. And then he disappears suddenly.
	Dan William opens the computer, and then he clicks the dialogue box, but Ian Moore has logged off.
	He closes the dialogue box, and he searches the latest news about him on the internet. Then he really finds the picture of him and July Summer on the internet. He glances at the name of magazine, and then he turns the computer off.
	It’s the time for Jamie Moore to live in the manor. But Jamie Moore still gets up later, and even the sun has risen highly. She walks out the room to have breakfast without washing her face and hair.
	"Mommy, as a lady, can't you comb your hair first and then come out? If I’m a little bit timid, I will be scared to death by you." Ian Moore looks at Jamie’s untidy hair and then says in a hate way.
	Jamie Moore yawns, and she still wants to sleep. She does not care about Ian Moore’s words. She sits on her position, and then she begins to eat bread, and says, “Honey, you haven't seen those real ladies. Those ladies are very graceful in the outside, and they also smile at others. But all of those are all floating clouds.” She takes a sip of milk, and then she continues to say, “When they come back to the home, they will change to another woman. They will lose all the graceful posture, and they even eat things with their hands.
Chapter 70 I will give you five minutes
	Ian Moore nods, and then he asks, “Do they all like you?”
	Jamie Moore shakes her hands, and then the bread fall back to the plate directly. She flicks quickly on the forehead of Ian Moore, and then she says, “Naughty boy, do you want to be beaten by me?"
	Ian Moore covers his forehead painfully, and now he looks very cute, “But mother has told me that I can’t lie to anyone, and I should tell the truth..."
	The eyesight of Jamie Moore becomes dangerous suddenly, and then she looks at Ian Moore.
	The phone rings at the moment, thus Ian Moore relieves. Then he says with his finger points at the phone beside Jamie Moore, “Mommy, you should answer the phone quickly!”
	Jamie More hums, and then she answers the phone, “Hello?”
	Ian Moore sits back to his place to eat bread. There are still steamed buns and pure milk on the table. He is different from Ian Moore. What Jamie Moore hates most is pure milk. When Jamie Moore hears the name of pure milk, she would frown. But Ian Moore likes to drink it. It’s said that child will be tall when one drinks more.
	"Do we have any agreement?" Jamie More asks as she eats the bread. It seems that she has forgotten the agreement with Dan William.
	Hearing this word, Dan William’s face becomes dark. Does she forget the agreement with him?
	Ian More is curious about the person calls the phone, but he sees that Jamie Moore moves the phone away, and then a roar come from the phone, “ I will give you five minutes, and you should go upstairs quickly. Do not let me go up in person!"
	Ian Moore nods suddenly. It’s his daddy.
	Hearing Dan William’s words, Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore who is eating breakfast beside her. Then her face becomes dark suddenly. She runs to the room, and she changes clothes within two minutes.
	"Mommy, are you going to have a date? Do you leave me alone?" Ian Moore puts the cup in his hand suddenly, and then he turns around and looks at Jamie Moore. He looks very pitiful.
	If you believe this, you will be the loser.
	But Jamie Moore has no way to face Ian Moore in such way, thus her heart become soft suddenly. She picks Ian Moore from the chair, and the feeling of touch is very good, “Mommy loves baby, and I will never leave you alone. When mommy comes back, I will bring you some pudding. Is it OK?"
	Ian Moore buries his head in Jamie Moore’s chest and pretends that he is crying. A few minutes later, he looks up and says, "Mommy, are you coax the baby? I understand you, and you should go quickly, because you only have one minutes now.”
	"What?" Jamie Moore looks at the clock. Sure enough, she puts Ian Moore down, and then she changes her shoes and runs to outside.
	Haha, he could treat her mother in this way. Ian Moore sits down and continues to eat breakfast. He shakes his leg, and he is very proud of this.
	But Jamie Moore, who is cheated by Ian Moore, doesn’t know all of this. She runs to the downstairs quickly, and then she sees the car of Dan William parks there. It’s a black Bugatti velon. What strikes others most is the license plate. The first letter is red S, which connects with the last number nine. It’s his birthday. In the whole country C, only his car dares to hang this brand.
	As soon as Jamie Moore gets on the car, the car drivers at full speed, and Jamie Moore even doesn’t have time to wear the seatbelt. Jamie Moore almost touches on the glass without noticing. She tries all her efforts to wear the seatbelt, and the speed is still very fast. Jamie Moore is fright, and she holds the seatbelt tightly. This speed is just to test whether she has heart disease or not.
	Jamie Moore’s heart goes up to her throat when the car passes other cars. And after the car passes the other car safely, Jamie Moore relieves.
	She almost gets mad for this kind of mood.
	Jamie Moore relieves when the car drives into to the manor. She looks pale now, and she even feels thirsty. She presses her lips, which causes a deep mark.
	Dan William just doesn't want to waste time, but when he sees Jamie Moore’s pale face, he feels a little regret. His eyes are dark, and then he opens the door on her side, "Get out of the car."
	Jamie Moore shakes her head for a while, and then she walks out of the car. Her steps are a little frivolous. The breakfast that she had just eaten rolls in her stomach. She even has some nausea.
	"If you can’t walk, you can say.” Dan William presses his lips, and then he squats down.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Does he want to pick her up on his back?
	"Are you stupid?" Dan William urges.
	Jamie Moore jumps on the back of Dan William in a trance. There is a long distance to the front of the villa. They should walk over a long avenue, and the leaves of the red maple around are laid all the way, and sometimes, some of them continue to fall on the ground.
	Jamie Moore puts her head on Dan William's shoulder. The smile on her face is full of nostalgic. In the past, even though Jamie Moore is not tired, she will ask Dan William to pick her on the back. Although he would despise her every time, he would always pick her up on the back to the end of that road.
	His back is very wide and warm, and it’s very comfortable.
	Dan William always wears a white T-shirt and black trousers. When he doesn’t say anything, he looks very attractive and cool. Whenever Jamie Moore comes close to him, she would smell the fragrance on his body and she will feel very peaceful. The whole heart would calm down.
	Jamie Moore puts her face close to the back of Dan William quietly and then she closes her eyes. She expects that they have more time to walk on this road.
	Dan William lowers his head, and he looks at the red maple leaves. He walks steady and slowly. His dark eyes are full of light, and no one knows his mind.
	Jamie Moore likes red maple, so there are many red maple plants in the manor. Jamie Moore likes to have sunshine but she hopes the sunshine is not too dazzling. And she likes the room with branches in summer. Dan William’s room is this style. Jamie Moore likes clothes in the color of white and black. She doesn’t know that one of the wardrobes in the cloakroom is for her.
	She does not loss those hobbies, since several years had passed. However, those hobbies even become clearer in her mind.
	So his love becomes quieter as time goes by. It’s like a breeze passing by, and then keeps silence.
	But he doesn’t know that whether he exists in Jamie Moore’s mind or not.
	"Young master, Miss Jamie." Seeing that Dan Moore picks Jamie Moore up on his back, Cindy Swift walks toward them happily. This is the second time that the young master has brought Miss Jamie here. It seems that the young master likes Miss Jamie very much.
	Dan William nods. Then he turns a corner and walks towards the direction of the pool.
	"Where are you going?" Seeing that Dan William doesn’t take her to the room, besides, he takes her to the empty ground, Jamie Moore is curious.
	"Can you swim?" Dan William puts her beside the swimming pool and then he asks people to bring two sets of swimsuits here. He throws one suit to Jamie Moore, and then he changes his clothes beside the swimming pool
	Jamie Moore stares at Dan William. She never expects that Dan William would change his clothes like this, “Swim is very skillful. How can I do this? "
Chapter 71 I will throw you to feed the shark
	In the word of Dan William, Jamie Moore could only swim in the swimming pool of the children. Only in this this way, she will not drown.
	Dan William changes the clothes in a few times, and then he smiles at Jamie Moore who is lying on the hanging chair. He walks to Jamie Moore and then picks her up, and then he throws Jamie Moore into the pool suddenly.
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore doesn't expect that Dan William would do this suddenly. She is thrown into the water, and the water rolls like fire. The water in the swimming pool flows into her mouth, and she feels that even her eyes are very pain. Her body temperature doesn't adapt to the cold water temperature of the swimming pool, so she shivers unconsciously.
	"Are you going to die?" It's not easy for her to get out of the water. Jamie Moore keeps dancing in the water. She looks funny, but she can't care so much. She just expects that she will not sink into the water.
	Dan William swims to Jamie Moore. He holds Jamie Moore’s hips with one hand and then drags her head away from the water.
	Jamie Moore holds Dan William’s head tightly. She tries all her efforts to throw the water out of her eyes. She even coughs with water in her mouth. It seems that she is choked. She is willing to learn and she thinks that she could learn it. Could he talk about with her before throwing her into the water?
	"Let go, or I will throw you into the shark pool to feed the shark." Dan William's hair has been grabbed by her. She grabs his hair so hardly that he feels so painful.
	Shark pool?
	Hearing this, Jamie Moore lets it go immediately. She knows that Dan William has two pools to keep sharks. But this is the thing happened five years ago. Does the shark become fat?
	If this is true, will she be eaten by sharks suddenly?
	"Changes the clothes, and then swims with me." Dan William says with smile. Then he puts her on the ground, and the smile on his face is very annoying.
	Jamie Moore's clothes are all wet and the clothes cling on her body. Today, she wears a white waist closing dress. When the clothes are wet, the clothes will cling to her body, which reveals the graceful figure of her. When she breathes, her chest will rise and down, which is just silent temptation.
	Dan William’s eyes become dark, and his Adam’s apple rolls up and down. Then he turns around. The water in the swimming pool is very cold, which could smooth the dry heat on the body.
	When Jamie Moore changes the clothes and returns to the swimming pool, she sees that Dan William is lying on the chair. He wears a pair of glass, and then he points at the swimming pool, and asks Jamie Moore to enter the swimming pool.
	Jamie Moore looks at the swimming pool, and she is a little timid. She wants to ask for the swimming pool of the children, but it’s too humiliating, isn't it?
	"Do you have a swimming circle?" Jamie Moore asks timidly. It’s so humiliating.
	Swimming circle?
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore who wears the swimsuit. The proportion of her body is very well. She is neither fat nor thin. Then Dan William says, “No, you waist is very thin.”
	What? Jamie Moore is shocked for a few minutes, and then she finds that his answer is not for the swimming circle. Who would ask such a question?
	"Streamer!" Jamie Moore’s face is very red. Then she walks to the swimming pool after saying these words. She sits down carefully, and she touches the temperature of the water with her feet.
	But this is just unnecessary, because she has just felt the temperature of the swimming pool. Now her action is just for nervous.
	"If you dare not go down, I can help you." Dan William lies on the chair in a lazy manner, as if he is on holiday.
	Unless there is something important, generally the staff in CR does not have to work on weekend. Employees will not be supervised, as long as they arrive at work on time.
	Hearing this, Jamie Moore is not hesitated. Although she doesn’t know the concrete reason that Dan William asks her to learn swimming, she knows it’s not a good thing. Thus she jumps down quickly, and she holds the iron bar tightly. The cold water overflows her shoulder, and she could only rely on the iron bar to get out of the water.
	Dan William stands up from the chair, and then he walks to the swimming pool and then jumps down. He swims to the side of Jamie Moore, and holds Jamie Moore’s feet in his hand, and then he pulls her back into his arms, and says, "Hold your breath in the water, do you know how to do this?"
	Jamie Moore wants to shakes her head, but she can’t. Dan William once taught this to her, but she tricked him. Now she can’t do anything, but to nod.
	Dan William holds her waist and lets her half float on the water. The water in the swimming pool reaches his waist, and we even can see six abdominal muscles looming under the water. The muscles are tight but not scary. The healthy wheat skin is enchanted by the water bead, and Jamie Moore is even attracted by this. It would be better if the place is changed.
	"Dan William, are you going to take me to the national swimming competition?" Jamie Moore waves her arms and legs. She relieves because Dan William hold her in the water. In this way, she will not drown.
	"Well?" Dan William answers in a shallow voice.
	"Or why do you want me to learn this? CR doesn’t require the staff to learn this. Jamie Moore is afraid that Dan William will let go suddenly. She swims in the water carefully while staring at Dan William’s hand. If he lets go suddenly, at least she can react to this to avoid falling into the water.
	Dan William stops for a while, and then he stares at the white skin of Jamie Moore’s back, then his eyes becomes dark, and then he says, "In order to avoid that you child ask such a question--if the woman you loved and the thing you loved fall into the water, who will you save first?”
	Jamie Moore is shocked, and then she refutes, “Do there have anything with the question of my child?”
	Her baby is so cute, and how could he ask such a question?
	"Hum." Dan William snorts and he doesn’t say anything. It’s not easy to answer this question. If Jamie Moore still loves him, no one could marry her. But if Jamie Moore doesn’t love him anymore, he will pursue her again and then marry her again.
	If she never falls in love with him, how could he do?
	If she doesn’t fall in love with him, it’s OK that he will not marry her.
	After practicing for an hour, it’s time for having lunch. Jamie Moore relieves, and then she swims to the side from the middle of the swimming pool. So she is not so stupid. At least she is not as stupid as a pig, Dan William thinks.
	"Let's go, we change the clothes first, and then we cook for ourselves. Dan William pulls her up, and then he hands the clothes prepared by the servant to her. Then he walks to the room to change her clothes.
	Jamie Moore looks around, and then she finds that the servants are gone. Although she has lived abroad for five years, she still can’t change her clothes outside.
	She finds an empty room, and changes her clothes. She does it quickly, and then she walks outside. What’s more, she even takes a shower inside quickly.
	Jamie Moore looks at the dress on her body. It’s a black dress with a black belt on the waist. It’s an eight piece skirt. The style is simple and it’s comfortable. What's more, the size suits her very well. It’s seems that the dress is just designed for her.
	Maybe it’s a coincidence.
	Dan William walks out the room. He has changed his casual clothes. He puts his hand in his pocket, and he walks forward. Jamie Moore follows him immediately.
Chapter 72 Jamie, do you think there is something bad with my taste?
	Dan William, are you going to cook by yourself？Jamie Moore walks into the villa with Dan William. They come to the kitchen, and they even don’t see any servants. Even Cindy Swift has gone. It seems that Dan William wants to cook by himself.
	Jamie Moore never sees that Dan William cooks something, and she also never eats the thing cooked by Dan William. Dan William is so smart, and Jamie Moore thinks the food cooks by Dan William will spoil her stomach.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is shocked, Dan William changes the words that he is going to say, and then he says, “Yeah, you can help me.”
	This is too terrible!
	"Mr. William, does the Cr go bankrupt? So you quit all the servants." Jamie Moore asks carefully. Except this, she can’t think other things.
	Dan William holds a green onion in his hand, and he is observing this onion. Hearing Jamie Moore’s words, Dan William kicks Jamie Moore’s forehead with the onion. Then he says, “Can you say something good? Get out, and I will call you when the lunch is OK.”
	Jamie Moore roars with her hand covers her forehead, and then she stays away from Dan William, “OK, the last question is what are you going to cook?”
	"Fried rice with eggs!"
	Hearing this this, Jamie Moore leaves the room at ease. The fact is that Dan William can only cook this. Fried rice with eggs is very easy, and she even could cook this, so it will be nothing to eat this.
	Jamie Moore casts the thing that Dan William could cook something to the side, and she walks to sit on the soft. She changes the channel with the remote control. It's a variety show. It's very popular recently. Jamie Moore will look at it with the cellphone when she has time to relax in the work.
	Bang!
	Hearing the sound, Jamie Moore stands up suddenly, and then she looks at chicken.
	Is this an explosion or an alien invasion?
	Bang!
	The sound rises again, and Jamie Moore gets her sense suddenly. She throws the remote control away and runs to the chicken. She sees the chicken is in a mess as soon as she walks to the chicken. The egg white and yolk all fall on the ground, and the rice even stick on the wall. What’s worse, the thing in the pan is really hard to realize.
	Is it the eggshell?
	Jamie Moore feels very terrible. Why he is so stupid? He even cooks the rice with the eggshell. She remembers that when she made fried rice with egg, she just put the whole egg with the rice, right?
	At that time, she put too many rice on the pot. She and Ian Moore eat it for several days, and finally, she throws them away.
	"Are you going to blow up the kitchen?" Jamie Moore looks at Dan William. He is really different from Ian Moore. Ian Moore’s cooking skill is very good. People will never want to eat the food cooked by others after he eats the things cooked by Ian Moore. But as for Dan William, his cooking skill is too terrible.
	“I remember that I should put the egg into the pot. But the egg explodes when I throw it into the pot.” Dan William blinks. Jamie Moore is familiar with that expression. Dan William will show this expression when he does something bad.
	"Throw the whole egg into the pot?" Jamie Moore is shocked, and Dan William is so silly in cooking.
	Dan William wants to nod, but he is pushed out by Jamie Moore before he could do this.
	When he takes a bath and changes his clothes, Jamie Moore has already prepared the food well. Seeing Jamie Moore’s figure is shuttling in the kitchen and dining room with the food on her hands, Dan William’s heart become soft. It seems that it even could put some other things in it.
	Jamie Moore makes three dishes and one soup. The dishes are eggplant, tofu with fish head and stewed ribs, and a pumpkin soup. Although it looks simple, it must be delicious just by smelling the fragrance.
	It seems that Jamie Moore’s life in England is not very well.
	Jamie Moore puts the bowl in place, and then she looks at the dishes on the table. But she is not very happy about this. For her, these things have become a habit. When she first arrived in England, she could only make noodles. But in order to make the baby in her stomach eat well, she learns how to cook. She even almost lost her child. If she doesn’t meet Chris Lockwood, she will never stand here.
	But Jamie Moore has never told this to others, and she just tells this to Ian Moore.
	Why?
	The reason is that she is lazy. It’s because of this that Ian Moore practices his cooking skill well. Then Ian Moore keeps this habit. As long as it’s time for dinner, he will cook dinner for Jamie Moore and himself. Sometimes, he will complain this to Jamie Moore, but he won't really let Jamie Moore do it.
	All beautiful things will accompanied by bitterness.
	"We can have lunch now." seeing that Dan William goes upstairs, Jamie Moore says with smiles. Her smile is very warm, and people will in a good mood when they see Jamie Moore’s smile. "OK." Dan William answers. He manages the button on the sleeve as goes upstairs.
	Jamie Moore rubs her hands and then she looks at the food on the table happily. For the foodie, the most enjoyable thing is eating. It's very enjoyable for foodie.
	"Mr. William, if you can't cook, you don't have to do it. After all, others are not as smart as me. Or it should be said that not everyone has gift in cooking." Jamie Moore eats the food in her bowl, and then she says. Seeing that Dan William’s expression is very gloomy, thus Jamie Moore changes her words.
	Nowadays, people even could not say the words in their heart.
	"When did you learn it?" Dan William asks lightly. Although the dish is simple, it tastes very good. It's not bad when compares with the cooks of the manor. But compared with those cooks, there seems to be other thing on the food.
	Warm?
	"It won't be long before we arrive in England." Jamie Moore bites the spareribs happily. For her, meat is very delicious, and she loves to eat it.
	"Oh." Dan William says in a light way, and one even could know whether he likes these foods or not.
	Jamie Moore blinks, and then she looks at Dan William, "Isn't it delicious?"
	Dan William wants to reply this question, but Jamie Moore says suddenly, “It's impossible. People all think it’s very delicious. Are there something with your taste?"
	Dan William's face become dark in a moment, then he stares at Jamie Moore and says, "Jamie Moore, do you think there is something bad with my taste?"
	"I refer to myself..." Jamie Moore shrinks her neck. Then she gives in under Dan William’s eyesight. She glances at the dishes on the table. She puts the food in her mouth quickly, and she is very satisfied with the food.
	"Wait! Have you been allowed to eat? Dan William looks at her with pride. Then he puts down his chopsticks and moves all the dishes to his front. It seems that he is protecting the dishes on the table.
	"I cook all of this. Why can’t I eat it?"
	"Does this dish belong to you?" Dan William takes a piece of eggplant and shakes it in front of Jamie Moore, and then he puts it in his bowl.
	
Chapter 73 Just take it
	"No."
	"Does this plate belong to you?"
	"No."
	“So what’s the meaning of your words?”
	Jamie Moore is angry. She doesn’t expect that Dan William is so shameless! It’s true that the things all belong to him, so does he feel terrific? He would only win her in a shameless way. Is this his ability?
	"If you have the ability, you could put those dishes down. We could fight with each other alone!” Jamie Moore slaps the table and then she stares at Dan William.
	But Dan William just looks at Jamie Moore, and then he presses his lips. Then he says with smile, “Are you sure that you could win me?”
	If I could win you, do I need to talk with you now? I can just rob it.
	Seeing that several spareribs are eaten by Dan William, Jamie Moore picks her chopsticks up, and she is ready to grab a few spareribs and eats it!
	Jamie Moore sits on the sofa with remote control in her hand, and then she looks at Dan William. She is a little annoyed. In the end, she only grabs two ribs. How could he grab spareribs with her? How about his cold image?
	"Dan William, are you abused by servants? Otherwise, how could you like..." Jamie Moore asks curiously. But Dan William stares at Jamie Moore before she finishes her words, thus she stops.
	"Jamie Moore, you really have a classic image." Dan William says suddenly, and then he looks at Jamie Moore with helplessness.
	“What?”
	“You can’t do anything, and you are so stupid.” Dan William walks to the stairs after finishing his words.
	If there is a place to add IQ for Jamie Moore, Dan William will send Jamie Moore to there. No matter five years ago or now, other people will get angry when hears her words.
	"..." Jamie Moore presses her lips and then she follows with Dan William. It’s true that the father and son have the same personality. They all said that she is stupid.
	Jamie Moore walks to the sixth floor with Dan William, and then she sees that Dan William walks into one room, and then Jamie Moore also walks into the room.
	There is a white piano in the room. The ground is very clean and we even can see the reflection of people. Dan William walks to the French sash, and then he opens the window. It’s the roof outside, but it has been stretched a lot. There are white and black tiles on it, and there is even sofa, swing chair and drawing board on the roof.
	Seeing the swing chair, Jamie Moore is shocked. Because this swing chair is the same as the one she owns in the childhood. Even the style is the same, and flower and vine on the top even is the same as before. He is really the Brother William in her memory.
	"Are you stupid?" Dan William kicks the forehead of Jamie Moore, and then he holds Jamie Moore’s hand and sits on the sofa, "Is the scenery very good here? I will give you an afternoon, and I have to see your design draft in the evening."
	"What?" Jamie Moore thinks the reason they come here is to enjoy the good view here. But she even needs to draw the design draft. Today is weekend. It’s weekend. Does she have to waste the wonderful weekend like this?
	"I have prepared the paper, pen and paint for you. You could do it now.” Dan William walks to the sofa and then sits on it. He picks the message up and then reads it. He ignores the bitterness and unwillingness expression of Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore frowns. He is really not romantic. He says those bad words in such a beautiful place. It’s better to play with the Barbie doll than draw the design draft.
	But Jamie Moore dares not to roar at Dan William, she fixes the drawing board and then she begins to paint with pen.
	Jamie Moore sits in the shade of trees. When the winds blow in, she could even smell the fragrance of the glass and tree. When sits in the shadow, she will not feel hot. The color in the sky is blue, and there is white cloud in the sky, and it’s very beautiful.
	One could see the whole scenery of the manor from this position. At beginning, Jamie Moore thinks the manor would not be very big, but now it completely overturns the original idea of her.
	Jamie Moore thinks for a long time, but she still has no idea.
	Click.
	A slight sound pulls Jamie Moore’s mind back, and then Jamie Moore looks around. She finds that Dan William has fallen asleep, and the magazine falls to the ground.
	Jamie Moore puts the drawing board aside. Then she stands up and walks to Dan William. Then she picks the magazine up. This magazine is the latest fashion magazine of the Cr. The model on the cover is July Summer. The background is lavender flower field in France. July Summer is very beautiful. No matter in which angle, July Summer is very beautiful. She wears a new-style white skirt, and she stands in the flower filed, smiling.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t know her feeling toward July Summer. But she does not hate her, and she also does not like her. Because when she looks at Jamie Moore, she is very calm. She has no hate feeling to Jamie Moore. When Emily Lin meets her at the first time, she shows irony to her.
	But as for Dan William, does he put July Summer in his heart？
	Jamie Moore feels empty in her heart, and then she puts the magazine to the aside. She squats downs to looks at the sleeping face of Dan Willian.
	Jamie Moore thinks Dan William is much cute when he falls asleep. He wears a T-shirt and black slacks. Thus Jamie Moore is in a trance, because now the figure of Dan William looks like the figure of him in the high school.
	In the high school, he wears a white shirt and black school pants. His smile is very clean and warm.
	His eyelashes are very long, and the sunlight splashes on his face through the branches, casting a layer of light and shadow, which makes his facial features more three-dimensional and charming. He presses his thin rose lips, forming a beautiful line.
	It’s true that Dan William is handsome. And his every action is very charming. When he wakes up, the atmosphere around him is very cold, and no one could approach to him.
	Now he has fallen asleep, and even his face become soft, and he is not so cold. Now he is just a warm big brother. But Jamie Moore knows that he would only show this when he falls asleep. When he wakes up, all of this will disappears.
	A girl, who could jump into his arm and ask for chestnut cake, also disappears…
	Jamie Moore looks at the sleeping face of Dan William, and then she touches the face of Dan William slightly. Then she stands up, and walks to the swing chair. She picks up the drawing board and begins to paint.
	When she finishes the design draft, it’s almost at the six o’clock. Jamie Moore smiles when she looks at the design draft in front of her. Her delicate little face is stained with some paint, which looks funny. What's the name of this design draft?
	Memories the lovers.
	Memories the lovers.
	On the day of the nomination meeting, the designer is waiting for the result after presenting the design draft.
	While Jamie Moore is waiting for the result in the office, Secretary Sam knocks on the door. He looks at Jamie Moore with a dignified expression and then says, "Miss Jamie, please come with me."
	Jamie Moore is shocked for a while, and then she puts the cup down in her hand. She stands up and walks toward outside with Secretary Sam. The elevator stops at the floor of Dan William’s office. Then Secretary Sam takes Jamie Moore to the VIP room next to the president's office.
	
Chapter 74 Are you Jamie Moore?
	There are five people in the VIP room, and Jamie Moore doesn’t know anyone except Dan William and Emily Lin. They all wear smart uniforms. Their names on the chest are preceded by two big black letters, CR.
	Jamie Moore suddenly understands when she sees that logo. It’s the design team of Cr. It’s said that there are 15 people in this team. Five of them stay in the building office of Cr, and others all stay at the branch of France and England. Now five people appears in this room, so there must something bad happens.
	Anyway, since Emily Lin stays at here, so it's definitely not a good thing.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore walks in, Emily Lin rolls at her, and then she turns around.
	Dan William sits on the single sofa, and the five people in the design team is looking at the two pictures. Dan William just sits there, and he doesn’t show any unhappiness.
	"Are you Jamie Moore?" The only woman in the design team walks to Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore looks at the card on her chest. And the name is Hebe Jun.
	In the fashion word, anyone should show respect to her, because she only designs clothes for the people she loved. It’s said that she has quitted from the fashion word. But Dan William tries all his effort to invite her to work for his company.
	"Yes. Hello, Mr. Hebe Jun." Jamie Moore says with smile.
	Hebe Jun nods and then she looks at Jamie Moore for a while. Then she takes the two design draft on the table to Jamie Moore, and then she says, “This is the design draft of you and Emily Lin. Why the style of the design draft of you two are so similar? Can you explain to us?
	Similar?
	Jamie Moore looks at her own design draft, and then she looks at Emily Lin’s. It’s really very similar. Moreover, she seems to have used the idea of Emily Lin's work.
	"I don't know, but I never copied other people’s work." Jamie Moore looks at Hebe Jun, and her eyesight are serious and firm.
	Hebe Jun puts the two design drafts on the table. Then she looks at Emily Lin and Jamie Moore and says, “You both said that you don’t copy others. What evidence can prove that?"
	Emily Lin looks at Hebe Jun and then she says seriously, “Master, you could compare my design draft with my previous works. I never copied others!"
	"Me too." Jamie Moore also says. She knows that she has to fight with Emily Lin, and she must win this fight. Otherwise, she will be fired.
	At that time, the face of Miss R will be lost, and the signboard of Miss R will be smashed.
	Emily Lin looks at Jamie Moore and then she sneers. She looks down at Jamie Moore and then she says, “You are just a new employee. Even if you have some works, who can guarantee that you don’t copy my work?"
	"Stop." Hebe Jun looks at Emily Lin and she frowns. "Secretary Sam, please bring the works of them to me."
	"Yes, Master Hebe Jun." Secretary Sam replies with smile, and then she walks out of the office.
	Dan William doesn’t say anything during this period. He just sits there, and his eyes are dark. He puts his fingers on his lips, and on one knows his thinking.
	Five minutes later, Secretary Sam goes back to the office. She calls up all the designs of Emily Lin in front of the crowd. The only draft that had been nominated is also included in it and it’s marked specially.
	But when Secretary Sam tries to find Jamie Moore’s design draft, she doesn’t find anything.
	"What's the matter?" Hebe Jun turns the notebook to Jamie Moore, and Jamie Moore's record is blank.
	"I can’t find any records of Jamie Moore here.” Secretary Sam says to Dan William. She knows that the president cares about Jamie Moore very much. As a designer of Cr, it’s impossible that Jamie Moore doesn’t have any design draft.
	No record? Jamie Moore is shocked. Then she hears the voice of Hebe Jun. “As a designer of Cr, doesn’t she have a design draft? I'd like to hear the idea of her."
	All people look at Jamie Moore, so does Dan William.
	But he's seen all of Jamie Moore's design drafts, and Jamie Moore's design drafts are all here. There's no reason that there has no record on computer, unless someone has did something bad to the computer.
	"Since I work as a designer in the Cr, I have drawn 18 design drafts, and all of them are handed over to Mr. William. Mr. William reviews them personally. I don't know why there is no record." Jamie Moore presses her lips, and the expression on her face is very serious.
	“Anyone in the Cr knows that there is relationship between you and Mr. William. Jamie Moore, do you think we are stupid?” Emily Lin interrupts Jamie Moore sarcastically, "It's naturally that Mr. William will help you."
	The reason she says in such a confident way is that she knows Bob Tutta doesn’t have any design drafts of Jamie Moore. What’s more, she has deleted those records in advance. Unless Jamie Moore has magic on making the design drafts, she will be loser today.
	Even if Dan William helps her, anyone in the Cr will know that she copies the design of others, and she will be fired.
	"Mr. William, what do you think of this?" Hebe Jun looks at Dan William with her hands around her chest. In fact, compared with Emily's sleeping summer, she is more optimistic about Jamie Moore's design—memories the lovers.
	But if Jamie Moore copies the design of others, it will be not allowed even though the design of her is good.
	This is taboo.
	Dan William doesn’t say anything. His eyes become dark, and no one know his thinking.
	The atmosphere in the VIP room suddenly turns silent. Jamie Moore bits her lower lip, and she is thinking. She must prove that she doesn’t copy anyone. However, all the design drafts of her in the Cr are collected by Dan William. If he doesn’t say anything, on one will know this.
	Is this true? Doesn’t he help her? Does he want her to be loser like this today?
	Joe Mo is a little depressed. Does Dan William want to fire her today?
	"OK, Since Jamie Moore has no evidence, so it can be judged…” Hebe Jun is going to say that Jamie Moore copies others’ design, and then she sees that Dan William says something to Secretary Sam. Secretary Sam's eyes lit up and then she begins to search on the computer.
	Hebe Jun waits and sees the cutthroat competition.
	Emily Lin puts her hands down, and then she looks at Hebe Jun in disbelief. She feels nervous in her heart.
	In the VIP room, we could only hear the sound of tapping the keyboard. Secretary Sam does it quickly, and then she puts the computer in the front of Dan William.
	Dan William smiles after looking at the computer. He turns the computer to them, and says, “Who says that she doesn’t have any design draft? Isn’t this the design draft?”
	Hebe Jun looks at the screen, and she is shocked, when she sees the familiar design drafts and the clothes on the model.
	"Mr. William, we know that you love Jamie Moore, but how could you take the design of Miss R as the work of Jamie Moore?” As the designer of Cr, Emily Lin also sees some works of Miss R. And she could realize the work of Miss. R at the first sight.
	Jamie Moore is a little shocked when she sees these works. Isn't that all her works when she is in FS? How could they be taken out?
	Yes!
	Since they can’t find any work of her in the Cr, but it doesn’t mean that she has no works in other place!
	This evidence is much more direct and effective than show her works in the Cr directly.
Chapter 75 The famous Miss R
	After looking at the computer for a while, Hebe Jun takes Jamie Moore’s work in her hand, and then she observers the works on the computer and the works in her hands quickly.
	"Mr. William, does this?" Suddenly, Hebe Jun's eyes lit up and then she looks at Dan William.
	Even if a person is good at imitation, he will bring his own personal style into the work unconsciously.
	As a representative of Cr design team, how couldn’t Hebe Jun find this? She knows that the two pictures must be drawn by the same person.
	If this is true, so is Miss R, who is famous in the fashion world in England, Jamie Moore?
	Dan William just nods, and he doesn’t say anything. But the smile at the bottom of his eyes reveals his mood.
	"Mr. William." Adam Lee knocks on the door and then walks in. He glances at people inside the room, and then he walks to Dan William, and then he hands a folder to Dan William.
	"Is this…?" Hebe Jun asks with her hands around the chest. Then she sees that Dan William opens the folder and then draws out a folded paper.
	"This is the design drafts that Emily Lin stole from Jamie Moore. Emily Lin throws the design draft into the garbage, but I find it.” Adam Lee explains.
	Emily Lin gasps. She shivers when she looks at the paper in Dan William’s hand. Then she says, "This, this is impossible."
	Adam Lee hands the design draft to Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore looks at it. Although it is crumpled, she can still see it clearly. It's the design she lost last time.
	"That's right. It's really my design draft." Jamie Moore nods. There is her exclusive logo on it. After painting, she will draw that logo in some place. This is her habit. Few people know this secret.
	"You tell lie to us! I don't know anything. You frame me!" Emily Lin yells at Jamie Moore in a hysterical way.
	"Oh? Why should I frame you?" Jamie Moore looks at Emily Lin and then she sneers.
	Emily Lin is in a panic. She comes up with several reasons, but all of them are rejected by her.
	"Because, because you are jealous of me! You're worried that I'm going to be the number one in the nomination meeting!"
	Dan William smiles after hearing this. His voice is clear, but it’s a little abrupt in the silent VIP room.
	"Do you say that Jamie Moore is jealous of you?" Dan William holds his chin with one hand, and he is in a leisure way. He looks at Emily Lin, which made her shivering.
	Secretary Sam receives Dan William's eyesight, and then she picks the computer up and then says to Emily Lin, "These are the works of Miss R in the past year, but I'm afraid that you don't know Miss R has a Chinese name."
	”Her Chinese name is Jamie Moore.”
	Sure enough.
	Hebe Jun looks at Jamie Moore, and her guess is right. This young girl is Miss R who has stunned the whole fashion world in recent years.
	It seems that she is just 20 years old, but she has such outstanding achievements. She is different from the designers she knew before. She is quiet, elegant and fresh. This is very similar to the work style of her.
	But Hebe never except that she would see the famous designer of fs here.
	"What?" Emily Lin takes a step back. She looks at Jamie Moore as if she has seen an alien.
	"How could she be Miss R? How can it be?" Actually, Emily Lin wants to say that Jamie Moore shouldn't be Miss R.
	"Even if you are Miss R, you are here to work for Cr. So welcome." Hebe Jun pats Jamie Moore on the shoulder, and then she leaves after saying these words. She presses the black hat on her head and then she walks out.
	Jamie Moore shrugs her shoulder, and then she smiles happily.
	But after today, the whole CR will know Jamie Moore is Miss R.
	But what she doesn't know is that all the people in Cr had been familiar with her name--Jamie Moore.
	All this is due to Emily Lin.
	Dan William holds Jamie Moore's work and then ponders. They are only two men on the work, but Jamie Moore outlines five sets of fashion clothes with the background.
	One person in the work is a man. The man stands under a tree, and he looks very cool, but his eyes are full of tenderness.
	Dan William looks at the woman on the work. The woman wears a black skirt with exquisite and prominent patterns. The painting of the skirt is obvious, but it would not give other people gloomy feeling.
	The people on the work are clearly the real portraits of him and Jamie Moore before, but the clothes have changed.
	He looks at the name, and then whispers.
	The exhibition is scheduled for June 5th. Even Jamie Moore doesn’t see the ready-made clothes of her work. It’s very mysterious.
	Jamie Moore sits on the couch on the balcony of the apartment with a straw in her mouth. She shakes her legs in a leisure way. Even though the nomination meeting is coming, she is not nervous.
	In other words, if she's nervous, she is not Jamie Moore.
	"Mommy, you need to sign for the package!" Ian Moore's voice comes from the porch.
	"Baby, please sign for Mommy." Jamie Moore is too lazy to move. Don't expect her to stand up if she sits down.
	Besides, it's a rare holiday.
	Yes, Dan William has given her three days off since she won the nomination.
	He asks her to have a good rest to welcome the exhibition.
	"Mommy, it's a big box." Ian Moore looks at the box curiously. After tearing the surface package, he can see the striking logo of Cr on it.
	Jamie Moore works in Cr, and Ian Moore is also influenced by her. He also knows that CR has its own brand, which is only sold in Country C, and it does not extend to foreign countries.
	"It's a skirt, Mommy." Ian Moore takes the things out, and he finds that it’s a red skirt with a V-shaped thigh. It has a ruffle at the shoulder, and there is a bright belt design around the waist. It’s very simple but eye-catching dress.
	"Can baby wear it?" Jamie Moore asks lazily. She blocks the sun on her face with a magazine
	Ian Moore feels embarrassed, and then he says, “Mommy, I’m a boy!”
	"Boys and girls all could wear skirts. Don't you think those Arabs with skirt look good?" Jamie Moore yawns and then stretches her body.
	Ian Moore decides to ignore her, and then he holds the skirt in his hand.
	The logo on it is Cr, and it’s his daddy’s company. That is to say, it’s his daddy who sends this dress.
	It seems that his daddy loves his mother very much. Thus Ian Moore smiles, and his face are full of smiles.
	"Naughty boy, what are you laughing at? You are so happy." Jamie Moore walks in and she glances at the thing on the box. Then she falls on the sofa.
	"Mommy, it's the dress from the company." Ian Moore looks at Jamie Moore who lies on the sofa with a smile. If you hear his words clearly, you will find the meaning of his words.
	Company.
	Company?
	Jamie Moore stands up suddenly, and then she pulls the box over. She looks at the logo on the box, and then she holds the dresses. She is shocked.
	The red dress is very eye-catching. It seems to be burning in the eyes of Jamie Moore. The fabric is soft and smooth. If you touch it with your hands, you can imagine the feeling of wearing it.
	
Chapter76 I want to kill him!
	Jamie Moore seldom wears red dresses, but that doesn't mean that red doesn’t fit her.
	She is sure that this dress is sent by Dan William.
	But it's challenging for her to walk out with this.
	Ian Moore pulls the box over when Jamie Moore losses herself in her thought. Then he finds that there is a necklace of the same style in it.
	Ian Moore smiles, and then he takes out a micro camera from his pocket and carefully puts it into the empty necklace. Then he pushes the box to Jamie Moore who is still in her own thinking.
	He won't admit that he wants to see the intimate scene of his Mommy and Daddy.
	He is a good child!
	...
	The exhibition is held in the Crystal Museum, which is specially set up by CR for the exhibition.
	At night, the whole crystal hall is particularly prominent in the night. It’s bright and dazzling. The whole Crystal Museum projects on the transparent building, and it’s dreamlike and unreal.
	There is a strict limit on the number of people at the exhibition. Most of people are the media reporters, of course, and even some small media reporters are invited. Those who are invited will not let go of this opportunity to get close with Cr. And all of them are present.
	As the protagonist of this exhibition, Jamie Moore naturally comes here early. But the exhibition has not started yet, so she wanders in the Crystal Hall.
	"Miss Jamie, the exhibition is about to begin. Please don't run around." Derek William follows behind Jamie Moore, and he reminds her timely.
	Jamie Moore suddenly stops and then she turns to look at Derek William. "Derek William, you must don’t have girlfriend."
	She says in a firm way.
	"Yes." Derek William answers without changing his expression. He doesn’t know why Jamie Moore asks him such a question.
	"Will I tell you that the atmosphere around you show that you are a single person?" Jamie Moore smiles in a naughty way. She has a smart and simple face, but it always gives other people a sense of cunning.
	A single man？
	Dan William’s face has no expression. Seeing that Jamie Moore walks into the bathroom, he walks away consciously.
	"We only have one chance. Don't let Dan William find out." When Jamie Moore is ready to walks out, she hears such a word.
	It sounds like a female voice, and she deliberately lowers the voice, so Jamie Moore can't judge who she is.
	Jamie Moore loosens her hand on the door, and she listens to the dialogue through the doorplate.
	Sure enough, the toilet is the most intriguing place. Jamie Moore thinks helplessly.
	"I don't care what are you going to do, anyway, I want kill him!" The woman says in a low voice, and her voice is full of venomous, and it’s just like venom, which makes Jamie Moore feel panic from the bottom of her heart.
	Dan William, his life...
	These words haunt Jamie Moore's heart like vines.
	Someone want to kill Dan William!
	The sound of footsteps outside the door is getting farther and farther. Jamie Moore sits down slowly against the door. Sweat is oozing from the palm of her hand, and her heart is still jumping abruptly.
	She knows that many people in country C are afraid of Dan William's power and means, and she also knows that many people want to kill him. But he doesn’t meet any danger for so many years. This time, she hears such an important thing.
	Jamie Moore is in a panic when she thinks of that venomous voice. It seems that she will lose something.
	Ten minutes later, Jamie Moore walks out of the washroom with pale face. At this moment, there are some people gathered in the Crystal Hall. Seeing that Jamie Moore walks out, Derek William walks to her.
	"Let's go." Jamie Moore raises her eyes and looks around. Her delicate little face is bloodless. She frowns hesitates.
	She's not sure whether those people are in here or not. She doesn’t tell anything to Derek William. And she is afraid of that her action will alert the enemy.
	It’s nine o’clock in the night.
	It’s half an hour before the exhibition begins. Jamie Moore refuses the makeup artist sent by Secretary Sam after changing the dress. She sits alone in the reception room. She walks back and forth on the soft carpet with her mobile phone.
	Dan William doesn’t answer the phone, and he even doesn’t reply the message send by Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore is very worried in her heart.
	"Miss Jamie, time is up." Derek William knocks on the door and then says outside.
	Derek William!
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become bright, and then she walks to the door quickly, “Derek William, has Dan William come yet?”
	Derek William is shocked, and then he withdraws his hands. He is curious about Jamie Moore’s action, “Young Master has arrived."
	Jamie Moore's tense mind finally eased down. She thinks for a while, and she wants to remind Derek William something. And then she sees several people come to them.
	Jamie Moore scolds in her heart, and then she smiles at Derek William, and says, “Let’s go.”
	Almost all people have arrived. The number of people is properly limited, so the guild hall is not crowded at all.
	The stage is facing the closed door. It is spacious, bright and spotless. The light is straight on it. The Milky floor is covered with a light luster. A red cloth covers what is behind. Suddenly, the light becomes dark, and the light on the lower part of the stage also becomes dark. You can only see the scarlet curtain by the weak light on the stage.
	It’s very mystery.
	Jamie Moore stands at the bottom of the stage and she watches the crowd. She is looking for the figure of Dan William.
	"Derek William, I'm very good here. You could find Dan William now." Jamie Moore has no choice but to say that to Derek William.
	If Derek William stays beside Dan William, Dan William would be safe.
	Derek William hesitates for a moment. Today, Jamie Moore is very strange, but the young master told him to stay with her. He can't disobey the order of the young master.
	"Your young master needs you more than I do. Really, Derek William, I'm not kidding with you." Jamie Moore says in a serious way.
	"Next, let's welcome the designer of this exhibition, Miss Jamie. She is a new and powerful designer of Cr." The emcee has finished his speech, and then he is waiting for Jamie Moore to come to the stage.
	"If you follow me again, I will indecent assault you.” Seeing that Derek William always stay behind her, Jamie Moore says to him viciously.
	Sure enough, Derek William stops after hearing this. He looks at Jamie Moore with some apprehension.
	"Go back to your young master, and I don't need your protection." Jamie Moore snorts triumphantly and then she walks to the stage.
	Derek William shakes his head. After thinking for a while, he goes to find Dan William according to Jamie Moore’s request.
	Although there is crowd in the crystal hall, Derek William still could find the position of Dan William in the fastest time.
	Dan William sits on the sofa on the side of the stage. There are several people in black standing beside him. No one dares to approach to him.
	Dan William holds a red wine in his hand and he slowly shakes it with his fingers. He looks at the figure of Jamie Moore with his dark eyes. He presses his lips, and it seems that he is in a good mood.
	He wears a white shirt especially, and there are two teeth marks on the sleeves of this white shirt.
	It’s Jamie Moore who sends this shirt to him.
	Of course, tooth mark is also Jamie Moore’s masterpiece.
	"Young master." Derek William walks to Dan William. He bows his head and says respectfully.

Chapter 77Young master is in danger
	Dan William looks side, and then he answers slightly.
	"Miss Jamie asks me to come here, and she told me that young master may be in danger."
	"Danger?" Dan William sneers and then he asks, “What’s the danger?"
	As soon as he finishes his words, he hears a scream under the stage, and then a loud voice comes from the stage. Dan William shakes the glass on his hand, and then he looks at the stage subconsciously.
	A breathtaking scene happened!
	The crystal lamp on the stage facing Jamie Moore's head has fallen half way down, and the part connecting with the top has gradually split.
	This crystal lamp is installed by Cr in order to create stage effect. How could it break suddenly?
	“Jamie Moore!” the glass on Dan William’s hand falls on the ground. Dan William stands up quickly and runs to the stage.
	It seems that Jamie Moore is frightened by this scene. She stares at the crystal lamp that is about to fall on her head. Her brain goes blank, and she has no thinking at all. It seems that her eyes are full of light, but in fact, her eyes are full of panic.
	"Run quickly!" a roar comes from the stage, and the scene is in chaotic.
	The crystal lamp smashes at Jamie Moore at a very quickly speed.
	"Ah!" The voice of screaming come from the stage, and the crystal lamp in Jamie Moore's eyes is getting closer and closer.
	Suddenly, a figure runs to Jamie Moore, and then he hugs Jamie Moore and rolls to the side.
	The crystal lamp smashes heavily on the stage floor, and the floor is dehisced like outward spreading crack. And the lamp broke into piece on the ground.
	Jamie Moore's calves and arms are smashed by the exploding lamp posts and fragments of the crystal lamp, especially the calves. The lamp posts goes straight into the flesh and the blood flow on the floor.
	The fact is that Dan William is not in danger.
	It's her.
	Jamie Moore feels dizzy. And an idea appears in her mind before she losses her mind.
	"Jamie Moore!" Jamie Moore is in a coma when Dan William walks to the stage. The blood on her leg tore his heart like a devil.
	"Young master, the car is waiting outside." Seeing that Dan William holds Jamie Moore in his arms, Derek William says calmly.
	A figure stands behind the scarlet curtain slightly, and then leaves in silence.
	"Quick, take us to the nearest hospital at once." Dan William holds Jamie Moore in his arm and then sits carefully in the back seat. He takes out first aid tools from the dark lattice of the back seat.
	He holds Jamie Moore’s arms, and there are some small pieces of glass on it. It’s blooding, and he holds the end of the piece with tweezers, and then pulls it out. He pulls the small pieces out of her arm quickly. After sterilizing them, he wraps them with bandages.
	Jamie Moore shivers in the whole process. Although she feels very pain, she couldn’t say anything. She could just frowns, and her face is as pale as the paper, and there is sweat on her face.
	Dan William puts her legs on his legs. That lamp post is not big or small, but half of it is in Jamie Moore’s leg. And it’s in a special position. He is afraid that she will be died due to excessive blood loss.
	"Here you are, young master." It’s Dan William who teaches Derek William to drive. They arrive at the hospital within three minutes. Of course, they ignore many red lights. However, no one dares to stop Dan William's car in country C.
	Derek William opens the door of the car. Dan William gets off the car with Jamie Moore in his arms, and he walks to the hospital quickly.
	"Mr. William..." Seeing Dan William walks into the hospital, the director of the hospital walks to him quickly.
	"Prepare for the operation, I want her to live in the word safely!" Dan William looks at him coldly, and his voice is full of tremor.
	Dan William sits on a bench outside the operating room. He leans against the wall and stares at the ceiling. No one knows his thinking.
	He is really frightened by that scene.
	However, Jamie Moore is hurt under his protection.
	He will never give this thing up!
	"Young master, it’s said that the crystal lamp is cut by a sharp weapon." Derek William reports to Dan William after answer the phone.
	Dan William frowns and then he presses his lips.
	Ian Moore has asked Night.1 to check the scene. He knows that his mother is injured and she has shed a lot of blood.
	But he can’t go to the hospital, because his daddy is there. The most important thing is that mommy is afraid Daddy will hurt him after knowing his existence. So he won't take the initiative to stand out.
	But Ian Moore still could do something.
	"Young master, we know who that man is." Night.1 says in a steady and calm way at the other side of the cell phone.
	Ian Moore's face becomes very dark, and his eyes are full of fierce which doesn’t match his age. He holds the phone tightly and then he says, "Who is it?"
	A black Land Rover is speeding on the road, and Ian Moore and night.1 sits in the car.
	Helen is Emily Lin's half-brother. The relationship of the Emily family is disordered. Helen's mother gets chance for Helen to return to her family. Emily Lin is the only daughter in the main family, but she has a good relationship with Helen who returns to the family later. Helen is very cruel. He takes the advantage of the Family Emily to bully others. He goes to many entertainment clubs. Many girls are killed by him. He is a real bully."
	"It’s Emily Lin who asks Helen to cut off the crystal lamp. The purpose is obvious." Night.1 turns skillful, and the car drives to the suburb.
	Ian Moore holds his hands, and then he puts his chin on his hand. His black eyes are full of light. He is very worry about Jamie Moore, thus his face are full of tension.
	Although he is young, he is very smart.
	Night.1 looks at Jamie Moore. He doesn't know what kind of parents can give birth to such a wonderful child. He has seen Ian Moore’s mother, but he never sees Ian Moore’s father.
	He really wants to know the future of this child.
	"How is my mother?" Ian Moore asks suddenly. His voice is still soft and waxy, and his eyes are full of worries.
	If mommy is OK, everything is ok. But if anything bad happens to his mother, he will kill that woman!
	"I don't know everything yet." Night.1 shakes his head.
	The Land Rover is parked in the countryside. Night.1 unbuckles his seat belt and gets off the car. He wants to open the door for Ian Moore, but Ian Moore has jumped down steadily.
	He walks with his short legs, and he looks like an adult. In fact, he is very smart.
	Ian Moore walks to Night.7 who catches Helen and Emily Lin. He puts his small hand in the pockets. He wears sunglasses, and it’s very cool.
	Night.7 wants to hold Ian Moore’s hand when he sees his hand every time. And he also wants to hug him and kiss him.
	Even though Night.7 is cold, but he still has a girl's heart. Especially, after he sees Ian Moore.
	
Chapter 78 What are your last words?
	Ian Moore is just like cute dolls, so he wants to knead and hug him.
	"Young master, what are we going to do next?"
	"Cloth." Ian Moore says. Night.3 nods after hearing this. Then he pulls the black cloth on Helen and Emily Lin’s face away.
	The brother and sister who sees the light narrows their eyes. The light of the car fall on the body of them, which make them feel uncomfortable.
	Dan William stands against the light. He is small, but other people will think he is an adult.
	"Who are you? What do you want to do?" Emily Lin shivers with fear.
	Is this a kidnapping?
	"As for this, you should know what you have done?” Ian Moore says coldly. His voice is soft and serious, so his momentum was not enough.
	"I see!" Emily is a little guilty. "You want money. As long as you let us go, we will give you as much as you want!"
	"Money? We don’t want money." Night.7 kicks the shoulder of Emily Lin. He sneers, "You make troubles with the person that you can’t."
	Ian Moore tilts his head and looks at Alan who keeps silent. He squats down and says. "Uncle, do you have any last words?"
	The voice is soft and warm, but other people will feel cold when hears the voice.
	"I, I..." Helen says, and he dares not to raise his head.
	Ian Moore finds that he pisses his trousers.
	“Night.1, pull the zipper up.” Ian Moore sneers and then he says to Night.1.
	Night.1 nods. He holds Helen’s arm, and then he pulls the zipper up. Night.1’s strength is big, so Helen can’t stop him.
	Ian Moore looks at the place where Helen knees. And then he smiles. Helen even pisses his trousers!
	Ian Moore never sees such a man. In his mind, a man should like his daddy. One should keep calm when something happens to him. One should be decisive in doing thing. And one should bow his head in front of the woman he loved, and one also should resist the temptation of the outside world.
	The more important is boldness!
	"Are you still a man? Since you dare to make trouble with my mother, you should think about the consequences." Ian Moore kicks the hand of Helen on the ground. It seems that he wants to vent all the unhappiness.
	Now, his mother lies on the hospital, so he will let this two man live in a hard way.
	"Mommy? Who is your mommy?" Emily suddenly opens her eyes. She looks at Ian Moore. They only want to make trouble with Jamie Moore, but they never hear that Jamie Moore has a son!
	So...
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and he kicks hardly.
	"Ah! Ah! Pain!" Helen struggles, but he is caught by Night.1, so he can’t move, and he could just stand.
	"Young master, do you need a knife?" Night.1 says suddenly, and he asks with temptation.
	If Ian Moore says yes, that means this child has the courage to convince them. If he says no, that means he is not qualified to be their master. They will not treat him as a leader.
	Ian Moore says without raising his head, “No”
	Night.7 feels disappointed. Then he sees that Ian Moore takes a small Swiss Army knife from his pocket.
	Her eyes lit up, and she looks at Ian Moore’s action.
	"No, don't kill me, I beg you! I don't want to die. I really don't want to die!" Helen shakes his head in fear, which disappoints Emily Lin.
	"Then I'll give you a chance. As long as you stab your sister's ankle with a knife, I'll consider letting you go." Ian Moore puts the Swiss Army knife in front of Helen. One could not see the expression of him clearly against the light, but his words startled others.
	Ian Moore is used to this. When he and his mother live in the England, they are often bullied by others. At that time, Chris Lockwood goes back to France. Every time, Mommy needs to try her best to protect him, otherwise, he will not be taken away by others. At that time, she is still young, and he doesn’t know all of this. It’s very lucky that he meets his mother’s schoolmates, and this uncle sends the knife to him.
	It’s not send to Jamie Moore but to Ian Moore.
	At that time, although Ian Moore is young, he still knows that he needs to protect Mommy.
	He is smarter than others, and he is mature than other people. He almost losses his life in Jamie Moore’s stomach, but it’s so lucky that he survives strongly.
	Nothing is important than his mother.
	"No! Brother, don't listen to him. I'm your sister!" Emily Lin losses his mind after hearing Ian Moore’s words, .Then she shuts at Helen.
	Night.1 told him that they have a good relationship. But Ian Moore doesn’t believe this. They don’t have the same mother, so this is impossible. What’s more, in other people’s mind, the identity of Helen is lower than Emily Lin.
	This is the difference between them two.
	"Do you think I really take you as my sister? The Emily Family only has a male heir, and it’s me. Who are you? If I hadn't been afraid of your mother, I would have turned against you!" Helen couldn’t care so much. Thus he shuts at Emily Lin.
	Helen scolds vigorously. “And as for your father, he always treats me bad. If I don’t exist in the world, your family would have no heir. You even don’t recognize my mother, do you really think I want this? When I take you house, I will drive you out sooner or later!"
	"Helen, you dog bastard! We are really blind. We raise you white wolf!" Emily Lin kicks to Helen. It seems that the relationship between them has broken.
	Ian Moore looks at them coldly. He suddenly feels sad in his heart. So what’s about him?
	If his daddy knows his existence, will he abandon his mommy?
	Ian Moore suddenly understands the worry of Jamie Moore. And he will not stay away from Jamie Moore.
	If this is true, he will not take him as his daddy.
	Ian Moore struggles in his heart. His face is lonely, which makes people feel sad.
	Suddenly, an idea flashes in his mind.
	"Night.1." Seeing that Helen really stabs Emily Lin with that Swiss Army, Ian Moore ignores Emily’s roar, and he turns to look at Night.1.
	“Yes.”
	"Tie them up and send them to Mr. William." Ian Moore takes over the Swiss Army knife and then says.
	Mr. William, the whole country C has only one Mr. William--that is Dan William.
	Although Night.1 feels confused, he still nods.
	"What? Didn't you say you let me go?" Helen opens his eyes in horror. He looks at Ian Moore, and he has a feeling that he will die.
	"Let you go? I just say that I will consider for this. But I never say that I will let you go.” Ian Moore smiles, and then he turns away.
	Helen knees on the ground. He opens his mouth, but he couldn’t say anything. His eyes are full of despair.
	"Where are you going now, young master?" After this, Night.1 has no doubt about Ian Moore. He decides to train him well.

Chapter 79 Send Gifts
	It's not fostered as the successor of the organization, but as the future master.
	"Hospital."
	…
	The operation lasts two hours, and then Jamie Moore is sent into the advanced ward.
	"The patient can't be disturbed. The injury of the leg is not serious. The patient should not to touch the water, and she'll recover after having a rest for a few weeks." The Dean tells Dan William all the precautions and then leaves.
	It’s very quiet in the ward. Jamie Moore lies on the bed, and the ward is white and dazzling. She is having an intravenous drip. She lies on the bed quietly with a pale face, and she is like a dead flower.
	…
	Dan William goes to the bedside and sits down. He tucks the quilt for Jamie Moore. His deep black eyes are full of love and chagrin.
	He looks at Jamie Moore's sleeping face quietly. The doctor says that he could not disturb her, so he sits there still, and his legs are numb for a long time, but he doesn't care.
	After a long time, the door of the ward is opened gently. Ian Moore stands at the door and then he walks in with his short legs, and Night.1 follows behind him.
	Dan William looks back, and then he sees Bunny walks in with black sunglasses and letter hat. The man behind him is cold and the atmosphere of the room fall to the freezing point since the man comes in.
	Dan William stands up and then looks at Ian Moore and Night.1 with vigilance and hostility. His momentum is more than Night.1’s.
	Night.1 is slightly shocked when he sees Dan William's face. This face is clearly the same as Ian Moore's
	Is it possible that...
	"Who are you?" Dan William says with a cold voice.
	"We're here to give presents." Ian Moore says with a low voice. He is still wearing black sunglasses, and he is sure that he would not be recognized by Dan William.
	Dan William frowns, and then the door is opened by Derek William. Derek William glances at Ian Moore and Night.1, and then he says, "Young master, we have found that person."
	"Where is it?"
	"That person has been locked in the basement, and it’s them that send the person to us." Derek William says.
	"What do you want?" Dan William is still cautious. In the uncertain situation, whether these two people are enemies or friends remains to be verified. What's more, they seem to know more about Jamie Moore's injury.
	"Jamie Moore is our friend since we are still in England. Since we are friend, we don’t want anything." Night.1 says.
	Jamie Moore's friend in England? Dan William stares at Ian Moore and Night.1. Just Looking at their temperament, he knows that they are not ordinary people. Had Jamie Moore bring his rival back to China?
	Seeing that Dan William has some doubts, Ian Moore goes to the bedside and then says with eyes focus on Jamie Moore, "If you don't believe us. You could ask her when she wakes up."
	"It’s better to be so."
	"Hello, my name is Ian. This is my brother Night.1." Ian Moore walks to Dan William. Because he is short, he has to look up. But this is the first time that he introduced himself to his father in his real name.
	When he thinks that Jamie Moore will know the thing when she wakes up, he knows that Jamie will bit him.
	"Yean." Dan William nods coolly. From Ian Moore's point of view, he could only see his beautiful jaw.
	Night.1 is sure that Ian Moore is Dan William's child, but Ian Moore's behavior makes him feel strange.
	Doesn’t Dan William know that Ian Moore is his child?
	This can also explain why Ian Moore disguises himself in front of his father.
	Ian Moore dares not to sit by Jamie Moore's side. He finally gets rid of his father’s hostile idea. Ian Moore still wants to cultivate a good relationship with his Daddy.
	Mom... Sister Jamie, how are you?" Ian Moore wants to call Jamie Mom. Fortunately, he takes it back in time and then asks.
	If Jamie Moore hears Ian Moore called her sister, the thing would become more complex, and he would be beaten by Jamie seriously.
	"The injury is not serious. She can leave the hospital after having a rest for a few weeks." Dan William says lightly. He does not have any antipathy to Ian Moore's caring words about Jamie Moore, and he even feels a faint familiarity.
	Ian Moore nods and then sits on the sofa in the ward. He looks at Dan William with his big eyes.
	After a while, Derek William comes in again. He says something to Dan William and then Dan William’s face changes. It is very subtle, but Ian Moore, who has been watching him, doesn't miss it.
	"Don't let them die so easily. I'll make a decision when I go back." Dan William orders coldly, and then Derek William immediately goes down.
	Jamie Moore doesn't wake up all night. Ian Moore asks Night.1 to go back first. Seeing that Dan William has no idea, he falls asleep on the sofa.
	His nervous tension is finally relaxed. Even though Ian Moore is smart and steady, he is just a child.
	The next morning, the sunlight comes in through the curtain of the ward. Jamie Moore who lies on the bed moves her eyelashes. After a few blinks, she slowly opens her eyes. Her eyes are full of confusion and loss. She looks at the white ceiling, and her nose is full of a smell of disinfectant.
	She turns her head and then she sees that Dan William is lying on the edge of the hospital bed with his chin propped up like he is asleep. His face is cold and clear, which has some invisible temptation to others.
	She moves subtly, but she still wakes Dan William up who is in shallow sleep.
	He opens his obsidian eyes. Seeing that Jamie Moore looks at him, he is very happy. The joy in his eyes is just like a suddenly blooming fireworks, and then disappears.
	"Are you awake?" His cool and mellow voice pulls Jamie back, and the sight in her eyes flashed, which is just like throw a stone into a pool of calm water.
	"Why am I here?" Jamie Moore turns her eyes and looks around and then the eyes stops on the drops.
	Her right leg couldn't move at all, and she could even feel pain. She only remembers that something hit her leg before she faints.
	Her legs!
	Jamie Moore's breathing is sluggish. She opens the quilt and sees that her calf is wrapped by gauze. Although she couldn't move, her leg is still intact and hasn't been sawed off…
	"Don't worry; I won't have your legs sawn off." Dan William tucks the quilt for her, and his voice is full of impalpable blandness.
	Jamie Moore nods.
	"Sister Jamie." Soft and sticky voice come from Jamie's left side. Jamie Moore looks at the direction of the voice subconsciously, and then she is shocked.
	Even if Ian Moore wears sunglasses and hat, Jamie Moore can recognize that this stinky boy is her baby at a glance!
	What's going on?
	Does Dan William find Ian?
	What’s more, what does this stinky boy call her? Sister!
	"You..." Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore. Her face becomes more and more pale. She looks at Dan William from the corner of her eyes, but she doesn't find any different emotions on his face.
	"Sister Jamie, have you forgotten me? I'm Ian. Have you forgotten our wonderful days in England?" Ian Moore grabs Jamie Moore's hand and then says with a smile, but he could feel that there is a cold behind him.
	This sentence is really too nauseating!
	If Ian is not a child, Dan William would have kicked him out.

Chapter 80 Mom's Words is Right
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and suddenly she feels the injured calf become more painful, but now it seems that Dan William still know nothing about Ian Moore. "Of course, I remember. You are Ian. Sister Moore misses you too much." Jamie Moore reaches out her hand and pinches Ian Moore's face intimately, but in the place where Dan William couldn't see, she looks at Ian with a fierce and evil expression. It seems she is saying that you will die soon.
	"That's good." Ian Moore smiles reluctantly. He feels that something bad is waiting for him.
	"Ah, it seems that you two have a good relationship." Dan William says with some relish. He has never seen Jamie Moore is so intimate with anyone except him. However, he relieves when he confirms that Jamie knows Ian Moore.
	"Dan William, I'm hungry." Jamie Moore suddenly turns her head and looks at Dan William. Her eyes are full of pitiful and watery color, which make Dan William’s heart feel soft.
	"What do you want to eat? I'll let Derek William buy it for you." Jamie Moore rarely show her coquetry, thus Dan Moore feel much better than before.
	"No, I want you to buy it for me. I want to eat the delicious signboard dishes of Papaya Street and the small steamed buns there!" Jamie Moore says in a soft voice. Maybe because she is illness, so her voice is especially soft and greasy, and it's very sweet.
	Dan William frowns and then rejects her proposal, "No, you just woke up and you can't eat anything too greasy now."
	Jamie Moore suddenly becomes upset. In fact, she just wants to send Dan William away with an excuse. By the way she wants to show her coquetry to Dan for the sack of her illness.
	"Well, I'll bring you the light dish in that restaurant, and you wait me here." Dan William's heart is soft. He reaches out and rubs her hair naturally. Then he turns and leaves.
	When the door is closed, Jamie Moore is not sure that if Derek William is watching outside. Thus she grabs Ian's collar and make him to sit on the edge of the hospital bed, ravaging his little face.
	"Mommy, I’m painful." Ian Moore shows his weakness and shrinks his neck.
	"Who is your mommy? I am your sister!" Jamie Moore feels distressed. Thus she lights her strength. She is very energetic except that her feet can't move.
	"Who dares to say that? As soon as we go out, everyone would know that you are my mommy! "Ian Moore looks at Jamie Moore pleasantly. He can't offend mommy for his little butt.
	Jamie Moore murmurs and then asks, "You should tell me the fact, why are you here? I remember you have a class today! "
	Ian Moore dares not to say that Night.1 asks a leave for him, thus he has to change the subject, "Mommy, that handsome guy just looks like me. Would he be my daddy?"
	What?
	Jamie Moore's thorns are almost up. She looks at Ian Moore and then asks earnestly, "Honey, have you seen each other?"
	"No, I disguise myself like this.” Ian Moore pushes the sunglasses on his nose, "But he looks like me very much, and he is very handsome."
	Jamie Moore relieves. As long as Dan William doesn’t know it, everything would be OK. Then Jamie reminds of something and she says, "Honey, mommy has told you that you are born from the watermelon. In order to cut the watermelon, mommy has kept it for ten months, so honey, don't think about it too much."
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. He would believe mom’s words before, but Mommy, Dad just leaves, would it good to say like this?
	"If the baby doesn't believe it, Mommy will show photos to you." Jamie Moore rubs Ian Moore's little face. The feeling of touching is really good.
	He would not be cheat by these photos which only have some fake watermelon seeds again!
	Ian Moore keeps silent and he decides to ignore it.
	"Honey, as long as that uncle is there, you couldn't take off this sunglasses and hat, understand?" Jamie Moore says to Ian Moore seriously. Her eyesight even glances at the door as she says. She is afraid that Dan William would suddenly come back.
	"Why?" Ian Moore pretends that he doesn’t understand mom’s words, and he endures to smile.
	"There is no reason, it's right to listen to Mommy’s words!"
	Ian Moore nods and he doesn’t retort. Anyway, he always listens to Mommy.
	15 minutes later, Dan William comes in with a delicious plastic bag. Seeing that Jamie Moore is holding Ian Moore's face, his eyes are shining.
	He fixes the table in front of Jamie Moore. Dan William takes out the box in the plastic bag, and then he opens the lid, and a strong fragrance comes out. It smells delicious.
	It’s a bowl of thin meat porridge, two boxes of date cakes, and a box of crystal dumplings.
	Maybe Dan is afraid that Jamie wants to eat something with a heavy taste, thus he also buys crystal dumplings and porridge.
	Ian Moore looks at the box on the table. His big eyes which like black grapes are very cunning.
	Interesting.
	"Why don't you go?" Dan William looks at Ian Moore. He doesn't want to chase Ian but if Ian Moore still stays at here, he will look like a high wattage light bulb.
	"I will be here with my sister Jamie. Sister Jamie, this strange uncle drives me away." Ian Moore looks at Dan William and then says in injured tones. He turns around and hugs Jamie Moore in a pitiful way.
	Dan William's face suddenly darkened. This smelly boy calls Jamie Moore sister Jamie, but he calls him strange uncle?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. If she can, she really wants to beat his little butt. Then she wants to tell him, honey, this strange uncle is your father…
	But Jamie Moore dares not to do that, she could only pinches Ian Moore's face with smile and cunning in her eyes and then says, “Come on, this brother will not drive you away. You should eat steamed bun."
	As Jamie says, she picks up steamed buns and then put it into Ian Moore's mouth to block Ian’s words.
	"How about me?" Dan William squints his eyes and looks at Jamie Moore with his hands around his chest.
	Jamie Moore is about to drink porridge. Hearing Dan’s words, she feels a little strange, and then she says, "Don't you go to work?"
	Hearing this word, Dan William’s face become more and more gloomy. Jamie is really an ungrateful woman. He has kept her for all night. Does she reward him like this?
	Ian William almost laughs when he hears Jamie’s words. Mommy is such a fool. The reason that Daddy stays here is that Daddy cares about her. He is a child, and he could understand this, but mommy even chases daddy away. Daddy is so pathetic.
	"What are you laughing at?" Jamie Moore turns her head and looks at Ian Moore inexplicably. She can be so calm when the baby and the father gather together. Jamie Moore really feels that her bearing ability is really strong.
	However, she seems to cheat two people at the same time, one is Dan William, and the other is Ian Moore.
	As for Dan William, she only has a little guilt, but as for Ian Moore, Jamie Moore feels that it is unfair to him.
	Jamie Moore feels depressed in her heart. Then she gives a fierce look to Dan William. If it isn't for him, how her baby could be so aggrieved!
	But, does Ian Moore really feel aggrieved? In fact, he feels cheerful in his heart.
	"I won't go to the company today." Dan William walks to the sofa and then sits down. He picks up the newspaper on the table and begins to read it.
	Jamie Moore takes a sip of porridge and then says, "Is the company closed?"
Chapter 81 Shut Up and Eat Your Own Food
	"Shut up and eat your own food." Dan William glances at her and looks back to the newspaper.
	Ian Moore can't stop it. He covers his mouth and chuckles, "Sister Jamie, you two really have a good relationship."
	"He is my boss." Jamie adds. She doesn’t want Ian knows more things between Dan William and her.
	But in Dan William’s ears, the flavor of this sentence has changed.
	"Then why does this strange uncle have to stay with you all night and worry about you so much?" Ian Moore pretends that he doesn't know anything, and he is asking advice, but in fact, he feels very happy in his heart.
	He has decided that he will do anything to keep mommy and daddy stay together. At that time, he would be able to pee on daddy's neck without any scruples.
	In fact, this idea also stems from the time when he is shopping with Jamie Moore in England. At that time, he meets a family of three on the street. The little boy sits on his father's neck and grabs his father's ear to play with him. The father not only doesn't blame him, but also dotes on interacting with him.
	Ian Moore always envies the little boy. He also wants to sit on his father's neck and goes to many places with him.
	But Ian Moore couldn’t tell these words to anyone, he could only hide these words in his heart.
	Jamie Moore’s face turns red quickly. Her delicate little face is as red as a rose. Her teeth are against her lower lip and she is embarrassed. She stares at Ian Moore, but it gives other people a feeling of playful.
	"It's just that the boss cares about the subordinates!"
	Ian Moore presses his lips wrongly. "Is this true? Mommy says that only a boyfriend can be so kind to his girlfriend. Does this strange uncle is sister's boyfriend?"
	Jamie Moore is stunned. When does she tell him that?
	Dan William smiles. Looking at Jamie Moore’s expression, he nods after hearing Ian Moore’s words.
	"Looking, the uncle nods." Ian Moore suddenly throws the problem to Dan William. It’s so quickly that Dan William could not redraw his eyesight and thus he looks straight into Jamie Moore’s eyes.
	"He's a child. Don't mind his words." Jamie Moore smiles, and then she reaches out and pretends to touch Ian Moore's face very intimately, but the strength she used is enough to make Ian Moore cry.
	That feeling is so overwhelming.
	Ian Moore quickly grabs Jamie Moore's hand. He presses his lips pitifully and pretends to be pitiful.
	"Well, I don't mind." Dan William says lightly. He sits in an elegant way, and he pumps his lips. In other people’s eyes, his dignified appearance is a picture, and it could be said as perfect.
	The charm of a committed man seems to pierce the calm look on Jamie Moore's face.
	Does... she's too amorous.
	A rhythmic knock on the door stops her thinking. Ian Moore walks to the door and tiptoes to open the door.
	A woman with delicate makeup and fashionable clothes is standing at the door. She has wavy hair, and wears sunglasses on her face, and she wears a pair of high-heeled shoes. She is tall and she is very fashion.
	Ian Moore's face suddenly turns dark. He remembers that this woman is a model that is photographed by the reporter last time with Daddy. Why does she come here?
	July Summer looks at Ian Moore curiously, and then she walks into the ward. At one glance, she sees Dan William is sitting on the sofa. She ignores Jamie Moore, who is eating steamed buns in the bed and who is still a patient.
	It's true that Ian Moore is his son. When Jamie Moore sees July Summer, she also shows a bad face. What does this woman do here? Does she want to show love in front of her?
	Jamie Moore doesn’t forget that she is so embarrassed in the restaurant at that day, and it seems that she has robbed others' things. It’s so annoying.
	Jamie Moore puts down her chopsticks when she thinks of here. And she losses all her appetite.
	"Honey ~ I hear the thing happened last night. It's really breathtaking. Aren't you hurt?" July Summer does not go to the exhibition because she is shooting in other places last night. When she knows the things from the TV, she comes back immediately.
	Hypocrisy！
	Jamie Moore pumps. She is a patient, but July Summer doesn’t care about her. Instead, she cares about Dan William who is not hurt. The fact is that she comes here to show love to Dan William!
	"Yeah." Dan William answers coldly. Then he finds Jamie Moore does not eat anything, and there is more than half of the food left in the box, so he puts down the newspaper and walks towards her.
	"What's wrong? Isn’t it taste delicious?" Dan William’s voice rises. Jamie Moore is shocked, and then she looks up and what appear in her eyes is worried eyes of Dan William.
	Does he worry about her?
	"Isn't this Miss Jamie? You are here, too. Hello, I'm July Summer." July Summer walks to Jamie Moore and she pretends that she just finds Jamie also stay here. Then she smiles and says hello to Jamie Moore right now.
	"Hello." "Jamie Moore replies dully, and then she covers herself with the quilt, and then says," I want to have a rest. If you want to chat with each other, please go out.”
	Dan William's eyes flashes. Is this girl jealous?
	"Then honey, let's go outside." July Summer smiles and then holds Dan William's arm.
	"Don’t you hear the words? She wants to have a rest. Get out." Dan William takes out his arm and scans July Summer's deliberately dressed face with cold eyes. His voice is full of the king's momentum which cannot be violated.
	Ian Moore stands in the corner, and he is almost ready to clap for Dan William. Daddy is so domineering!
	What?
	The smile on July Summer's face becomes stiff. She looks at Dan William with her big eyes sadly. She dares not to disobey his words, but she also does not show a sad and pretentious expression. She glances at Dan William and then walks out the ward.
	Jamie Moore covers her head with the quilt, but her eyes are open widely. Her cheeks are slightly puffs up, and she listens to the thing happened outside carefully.
	Dan William pulls the quilt to one side directly and looks at Jamie Moore with a funny look, "she has got out. Now you could sit up and eat something."
	Jamie Moore sits up awkwardly with his help. Her legs are numb, and she could not feel any pain at all, but the numbness isn't feeling very good.
	"Silent Jamie, my elder brother tells me to go home for dinner. Ian goes back first." Ian Moore makes up an excuse casually and then raises his face cleverly.
	Jamie Moore pumps. Brother? Where's the brother from?
	"I'll leave with you later. You're a child and it’s not safe if you leave alone." Jamie Moore worries about Ian Moore, thus she says.
	Her little baby is so lovely. What should she do if her little baby is hurt by some bad person?
	"Discharge? Who tell you that you could be discharged? " Dan William opens the box again, and the he glances at her lightly, and sends the lean pork congee to her.
	"Can't I leave the hospital today? It's not a big deal. " Jamie Moore eats the lean pork congee quickly and she eats steamed buns at the same time. At the same time, she also puts a steamed bun to Ian Moore as she eats.
	"If you think you can walk, I'll take discharge formalities now." Dan William takes out his mobile phone and plays it after he finishes his words. He is sure that she could not walk right now.
Chapter 82 Dan William, You Lied to Me!
	Ian Moore looks at his mother pitifully. Mommy's so pitiful. It seems that mommy is doomed to be eaten by daddy. They are not at the same level.
	Jamie Moore does not believe that this is the truth. She tries all her efforts move her legs. Unfortunately, the move involves the wound on her leg. She feels very painful, and her red cheek turns pale and she almost throws her left leg to one side.
	The word lame jumps into Jamie Moore's brain.
	"Dan William, you lied to me!" She complains and she pinches her right leg. It's as painful as amputation!
	"What do I lie to you?" Dan William is puzzled. Seeing that Jamie Moore is so painful, Dan William says with a worried eye.
	"You tell me that you wouldn't let someone cut my leg off. Now I am so painful, maybe my legs have already been cut!" As soon as Jamie Moore thinks of her sawn leg, she has a sense of desperation. How could she wear those beautiful skirts and walk happily in the future!
	Does she need to walk with crutches in the future?!
	Dan William pumps, and he helplessly touches the forehead. Then he looks up at Jamie Moore who lost herself in losing legs and says, "Jamie Moore, can you be a little more stupid?"
	Jamie Moore is even more aggrieved, and the aggrieved people are generally unreasonable, "What's wrong with me? My leg has been cut off and you even scold me! "
	"Who tells you that your leg has been cut off? Have you lost your brain? Do not you see your leg under the quilt? Dan William is so incisive that when he says these words, and she almost hurts Jamie Moore to the death.
	You are the pig! Jamie Moore angrily opens the quilt. When she sees her leg wrapped in layers of gauze, she finally believes that her leg has not been cut…
	"What? Is this your leg?" Dan William walks to her and he presses her calf hardly, which make Jamie loss her breath.
	"Who knows that is not this fake leg?" Jamie Moore jumps from Dan William’s hand. On the one hand, she glad that her legs are still intact, on the other hand, what she says is not what her thinking.
	Dan William feels very angry, and he leans down and holds Jamie Moore’s face with her hands. Jamie Moore’s face is soft and tender. He could even see the tiny fluff on it. He looks at Jamie Moore and then says affectionately under her gaze——
	"Jamie Moore, do you know that even pigs can beat you in IQ?"
	"Do you eat your brain together when you are eating food?"
	”Pig will be angry if I said that you are pig. How can you be so stupid?”
	This is the first time that Jamie Moore hears so many words from Dan William. Although…all words are bad to her!
	Is she stupid?
	If Jamie Moore can, Jamie Moore really wants to point to his face and proudly tells him that his son is in her hand. If he wants to see him, he should redeem his brain!
	"I'm so stupid, why are you still in the same room with me? If you have the ability, you can go out!" Jamie Moore looks at him with a good look, and her face is shining, and she is very proud when she thinks of Ian Moore.
	"In the same room?" Dan William chuckles in a low voice. Then he says, "You say that we are in the same room, so you are not afraid that what will I do to you?"
	Dan William moves close to Jamie Moore as he says. Jamie Moore could only passively lean back. She is a little fluster when she sees Dan William moves close to her.
	Pooh, why does she offend him!
	"I, I tell you, you should not do anything to me…There are children here..." Jamie Moore swallows her saliva. She even could smell the faint mint fragrance on his body when Dan William moves close to her. The warm smell of male surname kept approaching her, which made Jamie William's whole heart flutter.
	Dan William gently presses his lips, and he grasps her chin with his long fingers. He moves to Jamie Moore and then he blows his breath to her ears gently. Obviously, he can feel the little woman's body is shaking.
	"Children? There are only two of us here. "
	What? Jamie Moore looks around. Sure enough, Ian Moore has disappeared.
	Sure enough, she has a good son. At the critical moment, he leaves his mommy behind. Jamie Moore really wants to cry at the moment.
	"Don't you mean that I could do something to you if there had no child?" Dan William raises a ruffian smile, but he doesn't feel like a hooligan. Instead, it looks like a sense of life.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore stares at him. She has nowhere to hide herself. She couldn't believe that he could kiss her.
	"I tell you that I don't brush my teeth. Don't you have a habit of cleanliness?" Jamie Moore suddenly says. Although she has just let Ian carry water for her to brush, she doesn't believe that he will kiss her when hears her words.
	Dan William stops, but he does not leave as Jamie Moore thinks, and he says, "Does the toothpaste of the hospital is Yunnan Baiyao?"
	"How do you know this?" Jamie Moore blinks, and she blurts out subconsciously.
	She is regret after saying. Why does her IQ drop dramatically when she met Dan William?
	Jamie Moore even suspects that even if Dan William lets her jump down now, she would do it according to his willing.
	"Well, she's so cute." Dan William smiles. He reaches out and rubs Jamie Moore’s black and soft hair. It is not the length of the legendary goddess's hair. It is just over her shoulder, and the hair tail is very neat. It is as soft as silk. When he grabs the hair, hair would slip away from his fingers.
	Jamie Moore's face turns red in a flash. Is he praising her? Is this the legendary way to slap first and then give a date?
	However, it is very useful.
	---
	The next day, Jamie Moore leans against the hospital bed and plays with the tablet. she glances out from time to time, and she withdraws his eyesight as she does not see the sight of Dan William, and she continues playing.
	Time passes quickly. It’s already 12 o'clock when Jamie Moore sees the clock again.
	After playing with patience for a while, Jamie Moore finally losses her patient. She turns her head and looks out of the window. At this moment, she sees clearly that there is a person standing outside the window, but it soon disappeared, and it seems that this is Jamie Moore’s illusion.
	Is it Dan William?
	Jamie Moore frowns, and then she takes a pillow from behind and holds it in her arms. She feels confused. If that person is him, why doesn't he come in?
	Thinking of this, Jamie Moore turns her eyes, and pretends that she is playing with the pillow in her arms, but the remaining light in the corner of her eyes is fixed on the outside of the window.
	After a while, the man begins to show his face, but Jamie Moore could only see from the corner sight, so she could not see it very clearly.
	Sure enough, there is a person, but that person is not Dan William!
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore suddenly covers her abdomen, and she holds the corner of the pillow tightly with her hands. She shows her painful face to the window, and it seems that she is going to faint.
	The man outside the window hesitates for a while. Seeing that Jamie Moore is so pain, he immediately rushes into the ward. He holds Jamie Moore’s shoulders nervously, “how are you? Are you ok? "
	Jamie Moore quickly grabs his wrist, and then she looks up. She is shock and then says, "Why are you here?"
	
Chapter 83 Are You Pretending?
	It's Hooson.
	Hooson smiles embarrassedly. He wears a white shirt, a pair of beige Capris and a black hat. He looks very fashion and sunshine.
	"Are you pretending?" Hooson looks at Jamie Moore with a surprise expression, and then he suddenly finds that he has been cheated.
	"Well, how can I lead you out?" Jamie Moore puts a wisp of her hair down to the shoulder, and then she shows an expression of winner to Hooson.
	Hooson smiles awkwardly. He wants to take off his hat with one hand, but then he suddenly changes his hand.
	"What’s wrong with your right hand?" Jamie Moore notices the details and then asks.
	"Well, I hurt myself when I am going to help a friend." Hooson says. He looks at Jamie Moore with tenderness eyes.
	"That man is lucky to meet such a nice man as you." Jamie Moore is a little surprised. Because Hooson seems to be very sunny and warm, but she can see that he is not the kind of who loves handle thing related to others. So the man he saves is really lucky.
	"Very lucky." Hooson smiles, and he feels very happy, and it looks like he is a child who receive praise from other people.
	"By the way, why are you in the hospital? Are you hurt? "
	"I thought you'd know the thing happened to me since you watch it outside for a long time." Jamie Moore jokes. The feeling Hooson gives her is very similar to her friend in England, so when talk to him, she feels very happy.
	"I just pass by and I think I am wrong." Hooson explains and then he sits on the chair.
	Jamie Moore thinks for a while and then says, "Are we fellow sufferer? I hurt my right leg and you hurt your right hand. We really have the same fate. "
	"Miss Moore." When Derek William walks in and sees Hooson sits there on the sofa, he frowns immediately and his face looks ugly. He just walks away for a while and other people even walks in, and that person even is a man. If the young master knows…
	"Why are you here?" Derek William's voice is very cold. He looks at him warily.
	Derek William has been secretly protecting Dan William. Of course, he has seen Hooson.
	“Derek, he's my friend." Jamie Moore blinks at Derek William with a threaten eyes. She smiles cunningly, which always makes Derek William feel that danger is coming.
	"Miss Moore, I'm Derek William."
	How can Derek William not understand this? When Jamie Moore secretly throws Dan William's planning book or one of his favorite objects to the dump, she would look at him like this when she finds he sees all of the process.
	That expression only have one meaning. If he dares to tell Dan William, she will kill him!
	"Hello." Hooson says hello to Derek William with a smile. He ignores the chill of Derek William and then says, "I'm Jamie Moore’s boyfriend in the future."
	Puff!
	Jamie Moore almost slaps at him, "Don't talk about it. Believe it or not, I'll let Derek throw you out of here?"
	Here is the thirteenth floor. And he will die.
	"It's OK. As long as I can be Jamie Moore’s boyfriend, I'm willing to jump." Hooson says to Derek William provocatively.
	Derek William snorts coldly. He can only say something good. The truth is that he finds Miss Moore is stupid and easy to cheat.
	After staying with Dan William for a long time, finally Derek William also learns his methods.
	If Jamie Moore knows what Hooson will do, she will throw him out first.
	"Shut up. A man should not speak too much." Jamie Moore stares at Hooson. If he goes on like this, Derek William will definitely misunderstand him. If Dan Willian knows this, the thing will be bad.
	Wait, why does she care that if Dan William hears the words? He doesn't mind.
	"Miss Mo, I have to remind you that if the young master knows, you must know the consequences."
	"Are you threatening me?" Jamie Moore squints and looks at him coldly.
	"What do you want me to know?" The cold and mellow voice suddenly breaks into people's ears. Dan William who wears black tailored handmade suit walked in to the ward. His figure is well shaped in the black tailored handmade suit. His body exudes mature charm of male surname, which make people unable to open their eyes.
	Hooson notices that Jamie’s eyes suddenly burst with joy.
	"It's you." Dan William walks into the ward. He throws the mobile phone on the table. When he sees Hooson, he looks at Hooson vigilantly.
	He is very clear that Hooson has a different feeling to Jamie Moore. In the past, he would not have any idea, because he would not pose any threat to him.
	But when he asks Derek William to call up the video tape of that day, and from the video, he knows that Hooson uses his body to block most of the broken lamp posts for Jamie. And it is because of this, Jamie Moore is just injured in the leg, and the hurt is not very serious.
	If there is no Hooson, Jamie Moore can't wake up now.
	A person is willing to protect a person with his own life. Dan William knows that Hooson loves Jamie Moore.
	Dan William thanks him for saving Jamie Moore, but it doesn't mean that he will let him have a chance.
	"Mr. William, long time no see." Hooson stands up and shakes hands with Dan William in a friendly way, but his warm eyes are dignified.
	Dan William also shakes hand with Hooson and he says with a smile, "Mr. Hooson is really interested in things that don't belong to him."
	“I will wait to see your action.” Dan William says, the confidence rises from his body, and nothing could hide it."
	Who says that only women can have a war? Now it seems this is not the truth that man can meet each other with a hug, and says, hello, brother.
	That's all bullshit.
	Hooson doesn't stay for a long time. He confesses a few words to Jamie Moore and then left.
	Derek William goes out quietly. This time, no one is allowed to enter the ward and disturb them.
	"Who allows you to see him?" Dan William says coldly. Seeing that Jamie Moore is playing the tablet, and she shows no care about the things, he feels very angry.
	Does this woman have any sense of crisis? Is that man's love still a good thing to her?
	Think of here, Dan William become even angry.
	"He has his own hands and feet. Can I still tie him up and not let him come?" Jamie Moore answers casually, but the word is true.
	What's more, he comes here by himself. How could it all be her fault?
	Dan William's face eases a little. He pulls over the chair and prepares to sit on the chair. Then suddenly, he reminds that Hooson is just sitting here and talking and laughing with Jamie, thus he stops at once.
	"Derek William, throw this chair out." Dan William puts his hands in his pocket, and then he raises his feet to kick the chair away as he calls Derek William.
	"Yes, master." Derek William picks up the chair and goes out.
	Jamie Moore is silly. "Do you angry with this chair? And why do you have the ability to litter the hospital's public property? "
	Dan William snorts and he sneers at her words. "I'd like to."
Chapter 84 You have money and you are the master
	"Ok,ok,ok. You have money and you are the master." Jamie Moore also hums like him and her fingers keeps sliding fast on the tablet computer.
	If you have money, you can demolish the hospital. Jamie Moore says secretly in her heart.
	All of a sudden, Dan William lifts the thin quilt that covers Jamie Moore and he occupies the other side of the hospital bed under Jamie Moore's stunned eyes.
	"You, what are you doing?" Jamie Moore looks at the man who occupies her bed. Although the bed is big enough, she just sleeps in the middle. As soon as Dan William sleeps on the bed, the space shrinks to the minimum suddenly.
	What are you doing? Does he try to share a bed with her?!
	"What do you want me to do?" Dan William takes a pillow and puts it behind his head. He pulls the thin quilt, and covers his body with the other side of the quilt. He looks at her with a lazy and leisurely attitude.
	"I am a patient!" Jamie Moore gnashes her teeth. But she could not move. She is so close to Dan William that she even could feel the warm temperature of his body.
	Dan William doesn’t answer her, and he just says “um” and then he closes his eyes to sleep.
	If she isn't still ill, would the thing be so simple?
	Sniffing the light fragrance from his side, Dan William feels that his whole body is relaxed. All the fatigue is relieved at this moment and all is disappeared in his mind.
	Soon, Jamie Moore hears the long and subtle breath from Dan William, and she sneers. Does he fall asleep?
	How could he sleep like this after taking over her bed?!
	Jamie Moore turns her head and stares at Dan William. The dark circles under his eyes are obvious. His handsome face looks tired. It seems like he hasn't slept for a long time. Suddenly, Jamie Moore's heart softens.
	In fact, Dan William has no time to rest. He has no to time to have a rest since something happened to Jamie Moore. Right now, he just finishes the thing in the company, and then he immediately comes here.
	Jamie Moore reaches out her hand and pokes it gently on Dan William’s eyebrows. Then she takes back her hand quickly and pretends that she is playing the tablet computer.
	Very good.
	These two words suddenly appears in Jamie Moore’s head, but Jamie Moore could not tell the reason why are they so good.
	Jamie Moore thought that Dan William is probably the best person after her mother died.
	But since he treats her so well, why doesn’t he want her children.
	Jamie Moore's eyes are shining, and suddenly she feels even sad in her heart. Especially when Dan William stays beside her, she would not stop thinking about this.
	The game on the tablet computer has been over for a long time, and Jamie Moore doesn’t find out.
	Jamie Moore feels that something has blocked her throat when she thinks of this. She is the only one who knows the desperate fear.
	Maybe Dan William is cold and indifferent. And anyone is the same to him.
	Even though she grows up with him, he doesn’t let her go.
	Jamie Moore looks at the sleeping face of Dan William, and then she hides the loss in her eyes. She smiles suddenly, does he sleeps so happily?
	Just like in the past, when Jamie Moore is too full to sleep, but Dan William is able to sleep, she reaches out, and grabs Dan Moore's arm and shouts in his ear, "Get up! An earthquake happened! "
	Even though Dan William doesn’t want to wake up, he can’t. Dan William opens his eyes suddenly, and then he sits up and tries to pick Jamie Moore up and then leave. But he finds Jamie Moore smiles happily, and then he realizes that he is played by Jamie Moore.
	"Do you want to be beat?" Dan William looks at her lazily. He loosens his body, and raises his wrist and looks at the time. It's already four o'clock. He has slept for such a long time!
	Jamie Moore subconsciously covers her buttocks for fear that he will hit them for unhappy.
	But then she realizes that now she has grown up.in a flash, how could Dan William be so bored?
	If he beats her, she will cry loudly!
	"It's dinner time. What would you like to eat?" Dan William stands up and arranges his clothes. He rakes his own black and bright hair. The whole person is charmed by caste which could make other people blooded!
	Jamie Moore blinks innocently, and then she points to the snack bag on the table and says, "I'm full..."
	Dan William's face turns black. Looking at the bags, there are chips, squid and plum on the table, and everything is complete!
	"Who allows you to eat these junk food?"
	"Who tells you that these is junk food? Don't insult my treasure! " Jamie Moore puts her hand in the bag and takes out two or three chips and then puts them in her mouth.
	It’s so bring in the hospital. How can she live without it?
	"Do you want to eat food in the hospital? I can make sure that you will be like me if you eat food in the hospital. " Jamie Moore jokes. She throws a biscuit in her mouth and then looks at Dan William who is in anger.
	"Derek William." Dan William shouts in angry. "Go and change the chef in the hospital. Besides, no junk food is allowed to enter this ward in the future!"
	What?
	Jamie Moore is shocked.
	"Yes." Derek Moore walks into the ward, and then he picks up the snacks on the table and takes the chips from Jamie Moore’s hand.
	"Wait, wait." Seeing that the entire snack is in Derek William’s hand, Jamie Moore puts her hands into the potato chip bag and grabs a lot of chips quickly.
	Dan William’s face becomes even black, "Jamie Moore!"
	"What do you want to do? This is not produced from you family!" Jamie Moore glares back!
	"You could not eat that!" Dan William is going to grab the chips in her hand as he says. Doesn't the girl know that it's no good for her injury to eat them now? Can he still starve her?
	Jamie Moore acts more quickly than Dan William. She puts the chips in her hands quickly to her mouth and then crunches them loudly, and she ignores the stormy expression on Dan William’s face.
	The expression on her face seems to say that I have eat the chips, what could you do?
	“Do you want to be beat?” Dan William says angrily.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t believe that Dan William will hurt her when she is ill, thus she says loudly, "Are you dare to beat me?"
	"Do you believe that I will let you add new wounds on your old wounds?" Dan William says. When Dan William says this, his eyes are sharp, and he is extremely angry, which make Jamie Moore fear.
	"I believe it!" Jamie Moore says softly.
	"And do you want to eat this junk food in the future?"
	"I will never eat that!"
	Never eat? How is that possible?
	I will never let you know that I am eating junk food. If you have the ability, you can stay all day with me or you can contract the snacks of the whole country!
	Jamie Moore says in her heart, and she could only say in her heart, because she has no courage to shout it out.
	"Yeah." Dan William rubs her hair with satisfaction, and then he says with a smile, "Darling, if I find out you eat food like this, I have the ability to buy the whole food company of country C, do you believe?"
	Bah!
	Jamie Moore wants to kill herself. The thing happens as she says in her heart!
	"Pop White owns all the descendants of Nu Wa. Do you want to contract all the snacks?" Jamie Moore is a little weak, and she puts her chin against the pillow to show that he is tired.
	“Who is Pop White? Have you contact with other man?!” Dan William touches Jamie Moore’s face and then he says in a cold voice.
	
Chapter 85 Lose you grip
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes and then she suddenly remembers that he never sees these plays. He says, "A man who doesn't exist, and lose you grip."
	Dan William presses his lips and then his eyes flashed a touch of tenderness. Dan William moves his fingers away and then knocks on her head.
	"Uh!" Jamie Moore covers the place where he shots. Is he playing happily?!
	……
	When Jamie Moore stays in the hospital for five days, she couldn't help it. The game on the tablet computer has been played completely by her. If there is no junk food and no Ian Moore, Jamie Moore thinks the life is boring.
	She looks at the wall quietly, and the feeling in her heart has fallen apart.
	When Dan Moore comes in, he sees Jamie Moore lies on the bed like a dead fish. She stares at the wall with empty eyes. Seeing that Dan William walks in, Jamie Moore looks at him sadly.
	"Dan William, can we discuss something?" Seeing that Dan William walks in with a beautiful bag, Jamie Moore says pitifully.
	"You could say now." Dan William puts the bag on the table and then he takes the box out. Jamie Moore finds that the sign of the bag is snack shop in grapefruit street. The thing on the bag must be chestnut cake!
	"Can I leave the hospital early?" Jamie Moore stares at the chestnut cakes and swallows.
	Although the food in the hospital has improved, but her stomach is lone in these days without junk food!
	"What's the matter?" Dan William glances at her, and then he picks a chestnut cake into her mouth and asks.
	The chestnut cake in the mouth is sweet but not greasy. It melts as soon as you bite it. It's soft and fluffy. It's the same as what Jamie Moore ate when she was a child.
	"It's so boring." Jamie Moore chews the chestnut cake in his mouth and squints at him comfortably.
	"Are you sure?" Dan William looks at her.
	Jamie Moore feels hopeful and the she nods busily, "I’m sure, I’m sure, I’m sure, I’m sure!"
	"Derek William, please go through the discharge formalities." Dan William orders. Then he picks Jamie Moore carefully and he is prepared to leave.
	Jamie Moore holds the chestnut cake in her arms, and then she smiles with pride.
	But when Bugatti drives into the manor, Jamie Moore is shocked.
	She holds Dan William's neck and then shakes it hardly. "Are you wrong? My home is not here! "
	Dan William walks into the villa with her in his arms and then whispers, "Dr. Slater of the manor has excellent medical skills. He can cure you in the shortest time. How can you take care of yourself?"
	I have Ian Moore! Jamie Moore is a little crazy. Ian Moore could replace a hundred of Jim Slater, OK?
	"I can take care of myself..." When Jamie Moore says this, she is not confident enough. When will the wound be cured? My baby must think she doesn't want him.
	Hearing this, Dan William loses his hand. Jamie Moore falls into the soft sofa, and she can’t move any more.
	"If you can stand up now, I'll let you go back." Dan William looks at Jamie Moore. He indicates the housekeeper with his eyes that they could not involve in this thing.
	"Good!" Jamie Moore feels very happy. She holds the edge of the sofa and tries to move the leg to the side, but the right leg is hurt. It hurts when she moves. It's impossible to for her to stand up.
	She doesn't believe it!
	Jamie Moore clasps the sofa with her fingers. She clenches her lips and tries to put the strength on the leg, as if she is going to use all her strength.
	She never thinks that one day she would worry about standing up.
	It’s so terrible!
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore. She tries all her efforts to stand up. She is a person who never gives up when something bad happened. He doesn’t know that why she insists on going back, but he won't let her go until her injury is better.
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore's hand slips, and then her head fall to the right, and her forehead knocks on the hard glass table, which make her feel extremely pain.
	"Do you know the pain?" Dan William has no choice, thus he squats down and holds her head, and then she moves her forehead hair to one side. The temple on her head has turned red, and it even become purple.
	Jamie Moore does not say anything. She just pumps her lips, and looks very pitiful.
	"Master, please wipe the medicine oil for Miss Moore. And don't leave any marks." Cindy Swift walks toward them with a small bottle and then hands it to Dan William.
	Dan William unscrews the bottle of "medicine" oil, and takes the cotton swab delivered by Mrs. Cindy Swift, and touched some "medicine" oil on Jamie Moore's forehead.
	"Please be light! You are murder me! " Jamie Moore feels very pain, and she does not care any about the image. She reaches out her hands to get rid of Dan William’s hands.
	The servants around them couldn't help laughing secretly, and they look at Jamie Moore with disdain eyes.
	Cindy Swift looks at them sternly. All the servants are so scared that they dare not to laugh anymore and they hurriedly lower they head.
	"Don't move." Dan William holds Jamie Moore with one of his hand, and he puts medicine oil on Jamie Moore with the other hand. In this time, the strength is much lighter.
	Jamie Moore snorts for a few times. If you never ask me to stand up, I will never fall down and knock my head. Jamie Moore thinks in her heart.
	When the thing is over, Dan William hands the medicine oil to Cindy Swift. Cindy Swift immediately takes all the servants out of the room, and there are only two of them left in the living room.
	Dan William puts his elbow on the sofa, and then he looks at Jamie Moore, and then he says with a smile, “Now you can get up, aren't you good at it?"
	"I've changed my mind!" Jamie Moore says angrily.
	"Oh? Aren’t you good at speaking? " Dan William continues to make joke with her, and he says deliberately.
	Jamie Moore turns her head around, and she rejects to talk with this man.
	"Do you want to see the fate of those who hurt you?" Dan William asks suddenly.
	The people who hurts her?
	Jamie Moore’s eyes brightened and the she nods fiercely.
	Helen and Emily Lin are locked in the basement of the manor. Only Dan William and Derek William have keys of the manor, and the key can’t be copied. And the basement is not easy to close people.
	The basement is not as bad as Jamie Moore's imagination. In Jamie Moore’s thinking, the basement is wet and there are mouse crawls in it. However, in fact, the basement is very clear. Although the sunshine can’t enter the room, but the wall could be seen clearly with some weak light.
	Helen and Emily Lin are tied on two iron pillars in the basement, and there are knife marks all over their bodies, and it seems that they have lost their sense.
	Jamie Moore sits in the wheelchair that especially prepared for her, pushing away by Dan William. Although she doesn't like this, she bears it.
	Can't Dan William walk with her in his arm?
	Hearing the voice, Emily Lin raises her head in fear. Her face is full of blood, which is ferocious.
	Dan William pushes Jamie Moore and they walks close to them, finally Jamie Moore sees who the man is.
	The man is Emily Lin.
	It could be her.
	At the exhibition on that day, Jamie Moore overhears a conversation that make her mistakenly think that someone is going to be bad for Dan William, so she asks Derek William to go back to Dan William. However, the purpose of that person is not Dan William at all, but her.
	
Chapter 86 It's You
	At first, Jamie Moore doesn’t know the reason, but now, she knows everything.
	"Jamie Moore! You are bitch! You should let me go quickly!" Emily Lin shouts at Jamie Moore. The chain which used to ties her is pulled tightly and causes aloud sound.
	"It's you." Jamie Moore pumps, and then she smiles coldly. She looks at Emily Lin without any pity.
	Emily Lin always has a bad feeling to her, but she never thinks Emily Lin even wants to kill her.
	Is life so worthless in her eyes?
	"I can’t kill you even in this way! But when I see you like this, I think everything I do is worth!” Emily Lin looks at Jamie Moore badly.
	"Do you think you are in good condition?" Sitting on the wheelchair, Jamie Moore looks up and looks at Emily Lin, "If you think you are better than me, you wouldn't be here, would you?"
	Jamie Moore is not a well person, and she has no sympathy. It is impossible for her to forgive a person who almost killed herself, and she is not a person who will forgive other people that hurts herself ".
	Everyone makes mistakes, but it depends on what mistakes are, and whether the thing worth forgiving or not.
	As for Emily Lin, Jamie Moore never wants to fight with her, but some people could not see the well of others, thus they always want to make troubles.
	Now the things had happened, and everything can’t be changed.
	"Don't you think that you can do something bad to me? If I get out, I will kill you!"
	"Do you think that you could get out of here?" Dan William says coldly. His eyes are deep and condensed, and he looks at Emily Lin coldly. Emily Lin shakes a little subconsciously, and she dares not to look at Dan William. She feels sad. She tries every effort to get close to this man, but now this man announces her death in front of her.
	"I've never think about fighting with you. You should remember that it's you who takes yourself to the end, and you should not blame others." Jamie Moore says in a cold voice. There are domineering power between her picturesque eyes and eyebrows, and she is as proud as a "woman" king.
	"Please push me out." Jamie Moore says, and she thinks that the air here is a little thin.
	A person who doesn't have much contact with her wants her life, Jamie Moore, how bad is your character.
	Jamie Moore does not say anything all the way, and Dan William pushes her out of the basement silently.
	Of course, she does not notice what Dan William says to Derek William.
	He doesn't allow any possibility happens. Since Jamie Moore has a soft heart, he should be the villain.
	"Dan William." Jamie Moore says suddenly. The sudden sunshine makes her feel uncomfortable and inadaptable. She asks in a low voice and people could not judge whether she is happy or not.
	"Huh?" Dan William pushes her to the path. The wheelchair rolls over the maple leaves on the ground and makes a clear sound, which is especially pleasant on the quiet path.
	"Umm, I don’t do anything. Why would someone want to kill me?" Jamie Moore looks at the front in a trance. As long as she thinks that she almost died under the crystal lamp, she feels cold behind her.
	She has seen murders and dead people before, but she can't accept it if the act changed to herself.
	She is not timid, but she is not invincible.
	Dan William looks down at her. Her thin body looks extremely tough at ordinary times. But at the moment, there is some difference, which makes other people want to protect her.
	"Don't think about it. It's not your fault." Dan William raises his hand and comforts her by rubbing her hair. At this time, it would be better if Jamie Moore moves into his arms again.
	But even Jamie Moore is so bad, will she does that?
	"Are you touching the dog?" In a few minutes, however, Jamie Moore puts her mood in order, and there is no need for an unimportant person to influence her.
	Sometimes, it's good to have a fast thinking, and Jamie Moore is the kind of person who has a fast thinking but she also jumps something occasionally.
	"Are you a puppy?" Dan William continues to push her forward. His pace is very slow and steady, but his voice is full of joking.
	The maple leaves on the tree will occasionally fall on his shoulders. His dark and indifferent eyes are stained with warmth. Unfortunately, Jamie Moore could not see them.
	"Have you ever seen a puppy as smart as me?" Jamie Moore hums, and then she says defiantly.
	"..."
	Dan William does not speak anything, and he never sees a person who admits that he is a puppy.
	At the same time, as soon as Ian Moore and Night.1 parks in front of the "gate" of the manor, they are scolded by the "gate" guard.
	"No parking here, please leave as soon as possible!" Two guards in black uniform come up to them and stop them.
	Ian Moore pushes the sunglasses on the bridge of his nose. His small face becomes even smaller under the sunglasses.
	"We are here to visit your young master. Please let him know." Night.1 looks at the two guards. His eyes show funny and interesting eyesight under the sunglasses.
	"Do you have an appointment?"
	"No."
	"Then please leave now."
	Ian Moore's cheeks are bulging. He doesn't expect that it would be so difficult to come to daddy's house. He even has to make an appointment. One day, he will follow mommy to come here freely!
	Night.1 is even more straightforward. He takes out the mobile phone and calls Dan William directly.
	"Wow, when do you get his cell phone number?" Ian Moore looks at Night.1 adoringly. How can he forget that!
	"Last time when I went to the hospital." Night.1 looks at Ian Moore. It’s the first time that he sees Ian Moore looks at him in this expression. He feels a little happy in his heart. It's not easy to make Ian Moore show adoration to him.
	Ian Moore nods, and he looks around. He sees Dan William pushes Jamie Moore, and they are walk toward them.
	"Sister Jamie!" Ian Moore goes down from the guard's arm and shouts at Jamie Moore with his arms holding the railing of the gate.
	He knows that it’s better to shout at Jamie Moore than Dan William.
	Sure enough, Jamie Moore immediately turns her head when she hears Ian Moore's voice. Then she sees that Ian Moore stands outside the door and the she says, "Push me to there quickly!"
	She hasn't seen Ian Moore for a few days, and she misses him very much, so she doesn’t know that why Ian Moore could find here.
	Seeing this, Night.1 hangs up the phone and then he stands behind Ian Moore.
	Dan William pushes Jamie Moore to the front door. The big door slowly opens to both sides. The guard bows his head respectfully to Dan William and says, "Young master."
	"Yeah." Dan William nods and he is surprised when he sees Ian Moore and Night.1. in fact, there are few people who know that the manor is purchased by him. At least there will be no strangers here.
	He looks at Night.1, and he thinks in his heart.
	"Sister Jamie, Ian misses you so much." Ian Moore cheers and jumps into Jamie Moore's arms. He skillfully avoids to touching Jamie Moore’s injured leg.
	Jamie Moore's heart is soft. She looks at Ian Moore lovely, and then she says, "I miss you very much..."
	
Chapter 87 Stanger uncle
	Jamie Moore can never say these two words “sister”.
	Dan William is in a trance. The figure of the baby in the cake shop that day appears in his mind, which is similar to the figure of the Ian Moore. He wants to take off the sunglasses on Ian Moore's face.
	"Let’s go in." Dan William moves his eyesight from the face of Ian Moore, and then he says softly. Then he pushes Jamie Moore to the house.
	Ian Moore blinks and then walks into the house with them.
	"Now you are in the house, so you could take off your sunglasses." Dan William pushes Jamie Moore to the sofa and then says to Ian Moore. It seems that he is curious about the face under the sunglasses.
	Night.1 keeps calm, and it seems that he doesn’t care about this.
	Cindy Swift comes in with a tray. She puts a cup of juice in front of Ian Moore, and a cup of coffee in front of Night.1, and then she leaves the living room.
	It's strange that the young master should let others stay in the manor.
	Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore nervously. Suddenly she regrets that she is too happy. She forgets that Ian Moore's face can never be seen by Dan William…
	It's so terrible. She's so stupid that she even lets Ian Moore walks around freely in front of Dan William. She is really too brave.
	Jamie Moore, Jamie Moore, you are really stupid!
	She can already imagine Dan William's horrible expression when he sees the face of Ian Moore. There is something bad with her leg, so she will be difficult in running even if she wants to run…
	But Ian Moore seems doesn’t care about this. He takes a sip of the juice gracefully and calmly and then says, "There is a big scar on my face, so I always wear sunglasses outside."
	He says this in a grievance and unhappy way, which is a mood that a child should have, but he is calmer than ordinary children.
	"Oh?" Dan William raises his eyebrows. He doesn’t expect that the thing would be like this. Thus he has no way to ask more about this, and it’s even impossible for him to ask Ian Moore take his sunglasses off, which is just like adding trauma to his mind.
	"Yes, yes, I’m so pitiful." Jamie Moore hurriedly brings Ian Moore to her arms. She looks at Dan William, and it seems that Dan William has done something bad to Ian Moore.
	"Yes." Ian Moore hides his face in Jamie Moore’s chest and he even makes a face in the direction that Jamie Moore can't see.
	Dan William presses his lips. It seems that this little boy is pretending to be pitiful and compassionate.
	Think of here, Dan William walks to Ian Moore, and he lifts Ian Moore up with his hand on Ian Moore’s neck and then says, “If you want to say something, you could say, but please stop you action.”
	Ian Moore is shocked when he is lifts by Dan William. He waves his short hand and asks hug from Jamie Moore. He looks very pitiful, which refreshed the understanding of Night.1.
	It turns out that Ian Moore is only a child after all, even though…
	The man does not know the existence of Ian Moore.
	Night.1 looks at Dan William and then he signs in his heart. This man does not look like a man who would abandon his wife and son. Why doesn't he know the existence of Ian Moore.
	Suddenly, Nigth.1 thinks that it’s necessary to make a good investigation. Ian Moore is their master, and he is responsible for sharing his worries.
	"Hum,hum, this stranger uncle bullies Ian Moore!" Ian Moore sniffs his little nose and looks at Jamie Moore with his tearing eyes. It seems that the tear will fall down from his eyes soon.
	Jamie Moore feels very pity, but she couldn't stand up and grab Ian Moore. She is in a hurry.
	It's like going back to the time when Ian Moore is almost taken away by others, but she has no ability to protect him.
	"What do you do, Dan William? Let him go! " Jamie Moore is really in a hurry. No one could touch Ian Moore, Ian Moore will always be her weakness.
	Dan William holds Ian Moore in one hand, and then he stretches out another hand to touch Jamie Moore's forehead. Then he chuckles, "What's up? If others do not know the truth, he will think this is your child."
	Jamie Moore’s face turns cold. She looks at Dan William, but she doesn’t find any doubts on Dan William’s face, and she sees that Dan William even touches Ian Moore’s face. Thus her heart gradually drops.
	She seems to be very "agitating".
	Seeing this scene, Night.1 turns around. He doesn’t want to see any more and this family's thinking was too divergent.
	As a son, Ian Moore tries his best to cover up his identity. As a mother, Jamie Moore cooperates with his son. Dan William, who doesn’t know the truth, has good feeling to his son, but he does not recognize his son. It's a wonderful family.
	"Please look after your children." Dan William puts Ian Moore to Night.1. The fingers under his sleeves are slightly bent. The fingers that have just pinched Ian Moore's face are warm, and some unknown feeling is surging up in his heart.
	Night.1 takes over Ian Moore, and then puts him on the ground. Ian Moore only likes to hug his mother and Dan William. If other people hug him, he will feel very uncomfortable.
	"Brother Night.1, he bullies me!" Ian Moore pulls the pants of Night.1, and then says in a coquettish tone.
	Night.1? Jamie Moore’s eyes are shining. Night.1 has the same surname with her mother. There are not so many people called Night. What’s the family background of this Night.1?
	"Hum." Dan William murmurs, it seems that he has acquiesced to Ian Moore's words. He turns to looks at the time, and he finds that it’s time to let Jim Slater change medicine for Jamie Moore.
	"Sister Jamie~" In fact, Ian Moore just wants to be coquettish. But he does not why he will be so childish in front of his daddy.
	After changing the medicine, Ian Moore and Jamie Moore lie on the bed. It seems that Dan William has something to do with Night.1, so they are not present.
	Seeing that there is no one in the room, Jamie Moore immediately shows her personality. She catches Ian Moore, and then she touches the face of Ian Moore," Stinky boy, you are so brave. Who let you come here?"
	Hearing this, Ian Moore looks up at her pitifully, and then he says, "Brother Night.1 takes me here. Mommy, calm down."
	Jamie Moore raises his eyebrow, and the surprise flashed in her eyes, "Where is Night.1 come from?"? When do you hook up with such a handsome guy? Why I don’t know this? "
	Hook up? Ian Moore is a little embarrassed. He could not bear that his mom uses this though on him. "It's just a friend he knew unintentionally. I need thank him in this time, it is him that I could find the man who hurt Mommy."
	"Honey, don't trust strangers too much, or one day you will be sold and Mommy will beat you when you cry." Jamie Moore moves her hand on Ian Moore’s face, and then she says fiercely.
	"Well, I will not cry beside you, and the kidnapper will let mommy redeem the baby!" Ian Moore says what he has learned in the TV. With his vivid action, everyone will laugh after seeing his expression.
	Jamie Moore, “…”
	In the study on the second floor of the villa, the atmosphere is a little dignified. Night.1 leaned against the wall with his hands around his chest. There is no expression on his face. He looks at Dan William through the lens.
	"I owe you a favor this time. If you need hope in the future, you could ask help from me." Dan William sits behind his desk and says as he looks at Night.1.
	
Chapter 88 It's not me that help you
	Night.1 is definitely not that kind of person who loves money. It's better to owe him a favor than pay him. It's good for everyone.
	What's more, his surname is Night.
	Even if he has no relationship with family Gilbert it, Dan William has an intuition that there is absolutely no harm in "making friends" with him.
	"No, I'm not the one who helps you." Night.1 says coldly, and it seems that he is telling a statement of fact.
	If it isn't for Ian Moore, he will not hand people over to him.
	There is a kind of pride in the organization of five people. They don't care about contact with the outside world, and they hide in the dark for a long time, which makes them more reluctant to contact with the outside world. Although they are very cold, in Ian Moore's words, there are still some humorous in their cold heart.
	"Who is it?" Dan William raises his eyes. The light flashes in his dark eyes, which is very cold.
	Two men, who are equal in power, look at each other, and no one, are willing to give up.
	When Ian Moore comes out of the room that prepared for Jamie Moore by Dan William, Dan William and Night.1 also finishes the talk. Ian Moore is afraid that that he would not catch up with the latest variety show live when he returns back late. He runs around the villa on his short 'legs'. The sunlight outside the window pulls his little figure very long and it seems that he is paints a layer of golden color as thin as cicada wings.
	The villa is very big, but Ian Moore finds the second floor quickly without help of servant.
	At the corner, Ian Moore seems to be hit something when he runs around the corner. He falls back and his little butt hurts.
	He quickly stands up, and then he pats the dust on his butt, and then looks up at the man he hit.
	It's Dan William.
	Seeing that the man who is knocked down is Ian Moore, Dan William is surprised. He unconsciously raises his hand and puts it on Ian Moore's head, and then rubs his hair, "Are you OK?"
	Night.1 says that it is Ian Moore that sends Emily Lin and Helen to him.
	There are many cuts on Emily Lin's ankle, and all of these cuts are related to Ian Moore.
	At first, he doesn't believe it.
	But it seems that Night.1 has no reason to lie to him. He begins to look at Ian Moore who is only four or five years old.
	When Night.1 leaves at night, he actually says. It's a pity.
	What is the meaning of pity?
	Ian Moore is surprised that Dan William would "rub" his hair, but this feeling is not bad.
	"Ian Moore is fine." Ian Moore smiles at him and looks at Dan William with warm eyesight.
	Dan William squats down and looks at Ian Moore. His eyes are full of doubt. He raises his hand with a ghostly gesture. He gently pinches the edge of Ian Moore's sunglasses with his fingers and then whispers, "You..."
	Ian Moore's eyes suddenly open widely under the lens, and his chest leaps vigorously. His two small hands, which were hanging on his side, pinches gently and his hand exudes a layer of sweat.
	Does he find out?
	This idea appears in Ian Moore's mind, which make him almost stop his breath. Next, what he thinks in his mind is that would Mommy like it? Would Mommy still want him?
	Dan William holds the edge of the sunglasses and he is ready to takes them off. He looks at Ian Moore's sunglasses closely, as if there is something urging him to take them off. He is for fear of missing something.
	"Ian Moore." Night.1 walks to them suddenly, Dan William’s hand stopped. Ian Moore quickly puts on his sunglasses and walks towards Night.1.
	"Brother Night.1." Ian Moore relieves. He wipes the sweat on his forehead. Fortunately, he almost shows himself to Dan William.
	Night.1 takes Ian Moore’s hand, and his eyes flashed. He would not let Dan William know the existence of Ian Moore before he finds out the whole fact.
	If Dan William is the kind of person who abandons his wife and son, he is not worthy of owing such a smart son like Ian Moore.
	Dan William realizes that he has just lost his temper. Thus he stands up and then nods to Night.1 politely. Then he looks at Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore puffs up his cheeks with an unhappy face, then he looks at Night.1 grudgingly, "You mean it."
	Night.1 nods, "Yes."
	"Do you know the fact?"
	"Yes."
	Ian Moore's cheeks suddenly flattened. He touches his face. In fact, he just wants to know the expression of Dan William when he sees his face
	"Night.1, let's go to KFC tonight." Walking to the door of the manor with Night.1, Ian William suggests.
	"OK. But will your mommy allow you to eat it? "
	"Don't be so rigid. I know you want to eat it too." Ian Moore says happily. Although Ian Moore is a little disappointed, he inherits the optimism of his Mommy.
	"..." Night.1 does not say anything, and he has no interest to this.
	Ian Moore doesn't know that his regret tonight will soon become a reality…
	After a week of recuperation, Jamie Moore has been able to move freely.
	Dan William naturally has no reason to keep her. In short, there are many opportunities to see her in the company. He is not in a hurry.
	Jamie Moore refuses Dan William's offer to send her, and she goes straight into a taxi. She does not bring any luggage when she enters the manor, so she comes out relaxed.
	"Jamie Moore." A familiar voice rises in the car. As soon as Jamie Moore is ready to turn around, she feels a pain in the back of the neck, and then her body fall softly.
	A ferocious face appears in the taxi, and she looks at Jamie Moore with hatred eyes.
	Ian Moore learns from Dan William that Jamie Moore is on her way back today. He gets up early and prepares a big table for her. He also makes a small cake, which is Jamie Moore’s favorite.
	As time goes by, the meal is turning cold and the cake is melting. He quickly puts the cake in the refrigerator and then gives a call to Dan William.
	"What? Mom... Does Sister Jamie come back? …No, I am at her house. She never comes back!" When Ian Moore learns from Dan William that Jamie Moore has never come back, but he never sees Jamie Moore, he is suddenly in a panic. How could Mommy be missing?
	Dan William is even more surprised. At this time, Jamie Moore should have been home long ago. It's impossible that there is no one at home now, unless…
	Think of here, Dan William is also in a panic, and he stands up and walks out.
	Ian Moore goes out with Night.1 quickly. He dares not to neglect them at all. They let people get into a hole when they are at most relaxed time. They must find Jamie Moore as soon as possible!
	Jamie Moore is also not in a good state. She doesn't expect that she is knocked out by others as soon as her leg is well. Is she so terrible? She really needs to burn incense and pray. If she is killed by others one day, who will care about her little baby-Ian Moore.
	Jamie Moore's hands and feet are tightly tied by thick ropes, and a piece of cloth is stuffed on her mouth. The pain from her back neck makes her squint her eyes. A pair of her eyes stands out in the dark, but she looks around without any target point.
	
Chapter 89 Kidnappers?
	It's very dark here. Jamie Moore can't the environment around them. The air is thick with perfume. The floor is soft, which just like a sheep's carpet.
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes. The kidnapper really has a good taste.
	... Wait, kidnapper?
	Jamie Moore suddenly reminds of the face that she had seen before she fainted.
	She does not remember clearly, but it’s very much like a person.
	Mia Moore!
	It's her. The voice overlaps the face. It's Mia Moore.
	So it's probably Mia Moore’s room. Jamie Moore doesn't know how stupid she is. She ties her up, but she puts her in her own house. Doesn't she tell others that she's a kidnapper?
	The intelligence quotient of her…
	In recent days, Jamie Moore does not find that Mia Moore makes trouble with her. The fact is that she has found the way to treat her. She is waiting for her to get hooked herself.
	Think of here, Jamie Moore feels very unhappy. She never finds trouble with her, but trouble always rubs on her. Could she have a happy life?
	The fact show that it's not allowed.
	While Jamie Moore is finding something to cut the rope, the "door" suddenly opened, and the light on the wall is opened suddenly, and the whole room suddenly lit up.
	Jamie Moore squints. She opens her eyes when she adjusts the light. She sees that Mia Moore is standing at the door proudly, and she looks at her with a winning attitude.
	It's really her.
	If it isn't for the cloth in her mouth, Jamie Moore will scold her to death. In terms of language, Mia Moore would never win Jamie Moore. Maybe it’s because of this that she puts a cloth in her mouth.
	"Isn't this Mrs. William in the future? How can you be so terrible?” Mia Moore wears high-heeled shoes, and there is obvious dust on the carpet. It seems that she has no time to change her shoe before she comes.
	Jamie Moore couldn't say anything, and she could only glares at her.
	"Do you know how long I've been waiting for you there?" Mia Moore squats down; the long fingernails are painted with red. Her fingers across from Jamie Moore’s beautiful face and her beautiful face looks very cold and ruthless, "Since Dan William takes you away, I have been waiting there, and my aim is to wait for you to come out."
	"As expected, God still treats me well. You finally come out, and you're still alone. Dan William abandons you, so could not you stay there?" Mia Moore's nails are very long. It looks like that they have been manicured deliberately. The fingers scratches from Jamie Moore's face, and then left a bloodstain.
	It's no wonder that there is a taxi on that road. At that time, Jamie Moore was also stunned. She goes straight up without thinking about it. It’s naive to think about it.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, as if she could not feel pain at all. She had no words about the fast thinking of Mia Moore. Could the only reason she left Dan William's manor be that she has no face to stay there?
	So if Mia Moore knows that she doesn’t want to stay there and she even wants to leave quickly, how smart would she look?
	And even all of this is true; could this make up the reason why she kidnapped her?
	If Jamie Moore can talk, she really wants to scold her to death with words!!
	This feeling is too terrible!
	"Do you know how much I hate you?" The strength of Mia Moore’s hand is a little heavier, and it seems that she wants to put all the grievances and pains she has suffered in these years on her body. "From the first sight of you, I know that we would be enemies all our lives. Even though we have the same blood flowing on our body, but I never admit that you are my sister."
	Jamie Moore is surprises and a flash of amazement flashes in her eyes. She looks at Mia Moore, and she never knows that Mia Moore will hate her so much.
	Jamie Moore looks very cold. She tries all her efforts to put the cloth in her mouth with her tongue. Fortunately, the cloth is not very big, and finally the cloth is pushed out by her.
	"Why are you so fake?" When Jamie Moore could talk freely, Jamie More could not bear it anymore, and she says all the words in her heart.
	"Jack Moore will visit you every weekend, right? Does he bring a lot of good things to you? Do you really think that we don't know what you're doing out there? "
	"These so-called outdated clothes are brought to you by Jack Moore, right? You think you have been greatly wronged, but who are the people who really enjoy the love of father in those years? " Jamie Moore raises her voice and looks coldly at Mia Moore's stunned face.
	She has to tell her today that maybe she has suffered a little grievance, but this does not mean that everyone owes her!
	Jamie Moore doesn't owe her, and Adele Gilbert doesn't owe her. From the beginning to the end, they are all owed by Family Moore!
	Jamie Moore will never forget the hatred to Jack Moore at that time. She once said that Jack Moore should be pay for all of this!
	But now, his daughter actually comes to tell her that they owe them, which is really too ridiculous. She has seen that a thief yell to arrest him, but she has never seen that a man could be so shameless.
	Mia Moore’s face is twisted. Hearing Jamie Moore’s word, she kicks Jamie Moore with her foot. She kicks Jamie Moore on the shoulder and knocks her to the ground.
	Jamie Moore will never show a trace of pain in front of her even if she is really hurt, because the more painful she is, the happier Mia Moore will be. How can she make her so happy?
	"Bitch! I will kill you! " Mia Moore stands up and kicks Jamie Moore mercilessly. Fortunately, she doesn't kick Jamie's newly healed leg. Otherwise, Jamie Moore could not bear it.
	Hiss!
	Jamie Moore feels very painful, thus she does not make any sound. She wants to transfer idea that how you could do if I never make any sound when you kick me.
	"Jack Moore and Celina swift doesn’t know that you had kidnap me, do they?" Jamie Moore suddenly remembers something.
	If they are there, it's impossible for them to allow Mia Moore to treat her like this. Even though Celina swift is not there, Jack Moore will not allow Mia Moore to bit her. He doesn't treat her as a treasure. How can he let Mia Moore beat her?
	Sure enough, Mia Moore stops. Suddenly, she is pushes by Jamie Moore, and she is knocked down on one side of the cabinet, and her tears almost fall down.
	Mia Moore only knows to use strength, and she is not the opponent of the Jamie Moore who is in charge of housework. Moreover, Jamie Moore also learned Judo to defend herself in England.
	In recent years, Mia Moore has been eating well, drinking well and growing fat, thus she is not the opponent of the Jamie Moore.
	"Bitch! You dare to fight back! " Mia Moore is about to stand up, but she hears a cry downstairs, "Mia, what's the matter?"
	It’s Celina swift’s voice, she must have heard the sound.

Chapter 90 Where is Jamie Moore
	"No, nothing! Please go down now!" Mia Moore is a little flustered. It seems that she doesn't tell anything to Jack Moore and Celina Swift. She stands up quickly.
	“I’ll kill you when I get back!” Mia Moore kicks Jamie Moore before she gets out and then she walks out proudly.
	The door is closed, but Mia Moore forgets to turn off the light.
	Lying on the ground, Jamie Moore couldn't move at all. It isn't because that her hands and feet are tied up, but she is kicked too hard by Mia Moore’s high heels. She feels so pain if she moves.
	Jamie Moore even feels that her body has become blue and black. The place which is kicked by Mia Moore suffers a lot of pain, which is no better than when her leg was hurt at that time.
	She has a premonition that Mia Moore would not let her go easily this time. According to the extent of her dislike, it may be difficult for her to save her life.
	She can't just sit there and die!
	Jamie Moore raises her eyes hardly to look around, but she faints after a few minutes ago.
	Jamie Moore only has one idea before fainting. After going out, she must blow up the Family Moore to relieve her anger. They hurt her to death.
	Ian Moore and Dan William are looking for Jamie Moore separately. But both of them are very clever, and they all aim at the video tape of the road, especially the road section of the manor, and Ian Moore and Night.1 even transfer out the video tape of that road.
	Ian Moore stares at the picture in the video tape without blinking. He keeps fast forward and plays it back. Finally, he sees that the taxi in which Jamie Moore sitting does not go to the apartment, but go to other places. As for where it is, the video tape is just cut off there.
	"Night.7, finding out where the taxi with the license plate number of XXXXX is now." Night.1 called Night.7, and let Night.7 check directly. Night.7 is good at this aspect.
	"Ok." A clattering of keyboard arises on the other side of the phone, then Night.7’s voice comes, "In the public parking lot of XX villa area, the driver is a 'woman'. I will send you a picture."
	Night.7 hangs up, and he sends the photo to Night.1 quickly. Ian Moore steps on the stool to look at the photo, and his face sink instantly when he sees the person in the photo.
	That person is her aunt-Mia Moore.
	"Little master, do you know who is she?" Seeing that Ian Moore looks badly, Night.7 asks.
	"Well, let's go to Villa XX quickly!" Ian Moore jumps off the stool and runs out with Night.1. It can be seen that he is really in a hurry.
	When Ian Moore arrives at Mia Moore's villa area, Dan William has been at Family Moore's gate for a long time.
	Ian Moore is a little surprised. He thinks that he would be quickly than his father, but his father's was not bad.
	"Handsome man, you are a step ahead of us." Ian Moore gets out of the car and walks to the side of Dan William who is about to kick "the door". He only wears sunglasses and cowboy casual clothes. He looks very cool.
	Seeing them, Dan William is not surprise, and he just answers them with a hum. Then he raises his feet and kicks at the door, which looks very handsome.
	"Why are they here?!" Seeing that Dan William walks into the room, Mia Moore feels extremely panic. If Dan William knows that Jamie Moor is kidnapped by her, will he kill her?
	What to do?
	Seeing that Jamie Moore has no sign of waking up, Mia Moore has an idea in her mind. Then she hurries to take action.
	At this moment, Dan William has entered the villa. Mia Moore looks down and she takes Jamie Moore downstairs directly…
	Celina Swift sits on the sofa and watches the interesting opera. Jack Moore reads the newspaper beside Celina Swift, and she doesn’t realize that the danger is coming.
	Hong, the "door" of the villa is kicked directly, which make Jack Moore and Celina Swift look at it quickly. Unexpectedly, the person is Dan Moore. Jack Moore’s ugly face turns directly, and the transferring speed is amazing.
	"It's Mr. Dan. I haven't seen you for a long time. Please take a seat." Jack Moore hurriedly welcomes him up, and he smiles like chrysanthemum flowers.
	Dan William ignores him and he looks around with narrow eyes. He sees Jack Moore and Celina Swift, but Mia Moore is not at present.
	He looks at the second floor, and then he walks towards the second floor.
	"Um..." Jack Moore is surprised. Seeing that Dan William passed by him without saying anything, and he even walks to the second floor, he feels very confused. What happened?
	"Master, does he come here to find Mia Moore?" thinking of here, Celina Swift feels extremely happy, and then she follows behind Dan William.
	"Hum." It’s the first time for Ian Moore to see Jack Moore, but he knows everything that Jack Moore has done to his mommy. But now it's a big matter to find Mommy, so let him go for the time being.
	Jack Moore immediately returns to his senses, but he doesn't care that he had just been "colored" by a small boy, so he hurries to the second floor.
	How could Dan William come here to find Mia Moore?
	Even though Jamie Moore is not beside Dan William, Dan William has never love Mia Moore. Now he comes here suddenly. I'm afraid it won't be a good thing.
	Dan William comes to Mia Moore's room, and kicks the door and then enters the room.
	Ian Moore, who follows behind Dan William, smile. Daddy is so domineering. When he grows up, he will kick the door so handsome like daddy.
	Dan William walks into the room of Mia Moore, and he presses the switch on the wall. The strong perfume makes him frowns. He quickly looks at the room, and he finds no one is in the room. The curtains are all closed, and there even have no light penetrate into the room.
	He steps forward and watches for fear of missing a detail.
	Ian Moore's body is relatively small. He comes from the side of Dan William. When he looks down, he sees a button which is pressed by the bed.
	"Let me see." Dan William takes the button. The button is blue and translucent. The dress Jamie Moore is wearing today is a blue shirt. It should have fallen from her.
	Dan William stares at the carpet beside the bed. There are obvious scratches on the carpet, and some thin strips are also dropped. There is a series of footprints on the white carpet. It can be seen that Jamie Moore is tied up by Mia Moore.
	"Mia, Mr. Dan… " Celina Swift thinks that she would see that Dan William treat Mia Moore gently. But she does not see anyone in the room except Dan William and Ian Moore.
	"Mr. Dan, where is Mia?" Celina Swift does not see Mia now, but she remembers that she sees her right now. How can people disappear?
	"I should ask you that where is Jamie Moore." Dan Moore stands up and he holds the button in his hand. He looks at Celina Swift coldly, and he looks very cold.
	"Mr. Mr. Dan, what’s you meaning?" Celina Swift is so frightened that she steps back and she dares not to look straight into the eyes of Dan William.
	"What’s the mean? Your baby girl kidnapped my Jamie Moore. I'd like to ask you what does this means." Dan William looks at her coldly. Even if Jamie Moore is no longer liked by the Family Moore, she is definitely not a person who can bully at will!
Chapter 91 You Must Promise That You Would not Hurt Her
	Hearing Dan William’s words, Ian Moore smiles. He is very cunning.
	It seems that daddy has thought that mommy is his wife.
	Maybe soon he will have a little sister.
	Hearing Dan William’s word, Jack Moore is shocked. Does Mia Moore kidnap Jamie Moore?
	Jack Moore has some doubts, but when he sees the bad expression of Dan William, he thinks that things are wrong. He feels very fright.
	This unfilial "daughter", how could she do thing that caused damage Family Moore!
	Jack Moore hurriedly steps forward and pulls Celina Swift to the behind of him. Seeing Dan William is so angry, she feels very fright. He says tremblingly, "Don't worry, Mr. Dan. We'll let Mia send Jamie Moore back, and I promise that we will not hurt her."
	Mia? Jamie Moore?
	What a difference!
	They are all the daughter of the Moore Family. Is Jamie Moore the grass, but Mia Moore the treasure?
	Dan William presses his lips, and he looks at Jack Moore with ridicule eyes, "I will give you two minutes, and you should send Jamie Moore quickly. If you can’t, the Family Moore will disappear in country C."
	"Yes, yes." Jack Moore nods and then he calls Mia Moore immediately.
	"Dudu... The phone you dialed has been turned off. Please call again later... “The cold official "female" voice comes from the mobile phone.
	Jack Moore is so afraid that his phone almost falls down. He looks at Dan Moore and says, "Mr. Dan, you see..."
	“Stupid." Dan William says coldly, and then he walks out over them.
	Ian Moore stares at Jack Moore and then he goes out quickly with Dan William.
	Daddy is right. He is stupid!
	Celina Swift looks at Jack Moore, "my lord…Ah!"
	But Jack Moore just turns around and gives a loud slap to Celina Swift!
	Celina Swift is stunned and she covers half of her face with her hands. She is suddenly beaten by Jack Moore, and the tears in her eyes even come out.
	“How many times have I told you that you should not do anything to that girl! And you? Do you want to piss me off?" Jack Moore claps the 'door' for a while, then goes downstairs shakily. The Family Moore can’t be disappeared absolutely like this!
	Celina Swift sits on the ground, crying in a low voice.
	As soon as Dan William sits on Bugatti, he starts the engine car and rushes out immediately. As soon as Jack Moore chases out, the car just leaves.
	"Yes, sir." Derek William finds her position through the location system on Jamie Moore's mobile phone and then he immediately reports it to Dan William.
	"Location."
	"In the abandoned factory in coastal park."
	As soon as the voice fall over there, Dan William turns the car and then drives to the direction of the coastal park.
	"Young master, do you need to catch up?" seeing that Ian Moore sits up after Dan Moore left, Night.1 asks.
	"No, let’s give the opportunity to him. Let's wait for the news." Ian Moore smiles cunningly. This chance to save the beauty belong to Daddy. Ian Moore’s face is extremely soft and smart.
	Night.1 nods, and then leaves the villa area.
	…
	In coastal park, it’s almost at this moment. The curved crescent moon hangs on the velvet like black screen, surrounded by dazzling stars. The cool sea wind blows continuously. A black "color" Bugatti stops not far from the coastal park.
	Dan Moore closes the door of the car, and Derek Moore arrives at the same time. He walks to the factory which has been abandoned recently on the right side of coastal park with Dan William.
	It's very dark in the abandoned factory, and the ground is wet. The light penetrates through the crevices. You can only barely see the place where things are placed.
	As soon as you walk in, you could see Jamie Moore who is tied to the fifth floor railing. She is only ties with a few thick ropes. The whole person hangs in the air. Jamie Moore’s eyes are closed and she is still in a daze. Her face is stained with some dust. He looks very embarrassed.
	Mia Moore stands behind the railing. Mia Moore is still timid after all, and she does not get any help. She feels a gust of fear in this "dark" and "damp" abandoned factory.
	She has a fruit knife which is bought from the convenience store in her hand. The blade is sharp and cold under the moonlight. It seems that as long as she gently moves on her hand, blood would flow out.
	But after all, Mia Moore is the miss of the Family Moore. Even in those years she and Celina Swift are not stay in the Family Moore, Jack Moore never treats them badly. Even in these years, she can't peel oranges by herself. How can she know the process of kidnapping people? She does all of this according to the thing she sees on the TV.
	When Dan William walks into the abandoned factory, he sees Jamie Moore who is tied up in the air, like a drowning fish, and she could not get any support.
	The long and narrow black eyes are tightly tightened. He looks at Jamie Moore, and then he sees Mia Moore who squatting behind the railings horribly.
	"Jamie!" Dan William calls. But Jamie Moore is still in a state of "bewilderment", thus she does not answer anymore.
	Dan William!
	Mia Moore quickly stands up. She holds the handrail in both hands and looks down at Dan William. Her beautiful eyes are full of love, "Brother Dan..."
	She calls Dan William according to her heart. She could only pretend in front of Jamie Moore. The beautiful face of the man was like a deadly poison, which is an attraction to her.
	When Jack Moore holds a banquet to celebrating her first time to enter the Family Moore, she sees Dan William for the first time.
	The handsome Dan William seizes her heart at once, but no matter how she seduced him, he shows no love to her, and gradually she also losses her mind.
	But when Jamie Moore comes back, Dan William suddenly changes himself, and become another man.
	They are all the daughter of the Family Moore. Where she cannot compare with Jamie Moore?
	
Chapter 92 I'll Forget the Incident
	Thinking of this, Mia Moore’s eyes are a little fragmented, and then she looks at Dan William with hatred. "If you walk to me again, do you believe that I will cut the rope?"
	She moves the knife to Jamie Moore closely as she says.
	"Wait!" Dan William stops Mia Moore, and then he says tightly, "What do you want? If you let Jamie Moore go, we can talk. "
	"Talk? Dan William, do you think I'm stupid? If I let her go now, you'll push me to hell the next second. " Jamie yells at him. She is excited. Several times, the knife almost rubs Jamie Moore, and she is frightened.
	Dan William gives a look to Derek William. Derek William nods, and then the figure disappears.
	"I promise, as long as you let Jamie Moore go, I will never find trouble with you again. I will do what I say." Dan William says earnestly.
	Mia Moore is a little lax. She looks at Dan William with some hope, "Are you serious?"
	Seeing that Mia Moore losses her mind, Dan William promises immediately, "I’m serious."
	Mia Moore takes back her hand. At this moment, Derek William just walks behind her. Derek William kicks Mia Moore on the shoulder before Mia has time to shout, and then he quickly takes up his hand.
	As soon as Mia Moore wants to say something, Mia Moore faints on the ground. The knife in her hand falls on the ground and makes a clear sound.
	Derek William immediately kicks the knife downstairs, and then he begins to untie the rope that bound Jamie Moore's hands.
	When Dan William arrives at the fifth floor, Derek William has pulled Jamie Moore down. At this moment, Jamie Moore has wake up. She looks at the front barely.
	"Jamie Moore, it's all right." Dan William is a little distressed. He reaches out and pulls Jamie Moore into his arms. He puts his big hand on her hair and closed eyes slightly, and his eyes are full of tenderness.
	Hugged by Dan William, Jamie Moore could smell the light mint fragrance from Dan William. She feels very safe, and she wants that time could be stopped at this moment.
	Dan William gently holds her up horizontally. He glances at Mia Moore who lies on the ground, and then goes out of the abandoned factory with steady steps. Every step is particularly steady, which make Jamie Moore feel that this man can rely on.
	"Back to the manor." Dan William puts Jamie Moore in the back seat, and then he also sits on the car, and he then he orders.
	"Wait!" Hearing this, Jamie Moore is surprised. She pulls the sleeve of Dan William and then says, "I want to go home."
	She wants to see Ian Moore. These days, bad thing happened one by one, which make her in dizzy. She hasn't seen Ian Moore for several days. She feels insecure.
	Jamie Moore, who is still confused, seems to ignore an important fact.
	"Go to Pennies House." Dan William does not refuse Jamie Moore’s request. He asks Derek Moore drives to Pennies House directly.
	After these times, he would never let Jamie Moore disappear in his sight again, let alone let those who are in the wrong mood get another chance.
	He doesn’t want to taste the feeling of desperation about losing her.
	The coastal park is not very close to Jamie Moore's apartment. The whole journey will take about 30 minutes. Jamie Moore's mood has not been adjusted. She falls asleep on the shoulder of Dan William.
	There are bruises in some parts of the delicate little face, and it seems that it is deliberately smashed by something. There are big and even there are some cuts in her hand.
	Dan William’s face turns bad immediately. Dare Mia Moore beat her?
	At the same time, Ian Moore and Night.1 are eating barbecue in the barbecue restaurant. The restaurant is not far away from the Pennies House. He doesn’t know that Dan William has taken Jamie Moore to Pennies House.
	What's more, Ian Moore's things have not been cleaned up, so the clothes just put on every area of the room. If Dan William sees this, his expression could be imagined.
	"You could not add anymore, young master." Night.1 is not good at eating spicy, but the chili sauce of this barbecue is too choking, which is really a bit overwhelming.
	Ian Moore eats it happily. He eats one by one, and he even does not drink any water. The plates on the table have been folded on three sides, so we can imagine how much they ate.
	"Night.1, if you are a man, you should eat it. I'm not afraid, but you afraid. " Ian Moore takes a bite of the freshly baked squid. The feeling of the sucker is so good. Sprinkle cumin on it, and brush a layer of chili sauce, and drink a coke, and take a bite of squid. This is Jamie Moore's favorite way of eating.
	That feeling I really too good, which make people enjoy it very much.
	Ian Moore also learned this skill from Jamie Moore. Since Dan William goes to save his mother, he comes to eat and drink. As long as he wipes his mouth clean, he would not be found by Jamie Moore.
	Hearing Ian Moore’s words, Night.1 is shocked. Looking at the chili sauce in front of him, and he suddenly has a feeling that if he does not eat this entire thing, Ian Moore would despise him!
	
Chapter 93 Who is Your Father?
	It is just the chili sauce. Since that Ian Moore could eat it, he can eat it too!
	"It goes well with cola!" Ian Moore generously hands the cola to Night.1 and orders him to drink the cola.
	Night.1 takes the cola over without hesitation, and he then pours the cola into the mouth. That feeling is really very good. The cold cola exchanges with the abnormal spicy taste of chili sauce, which made the taste buds open to the extreme!
	As for this eating method, Ian Moore suggests that other people should use it less. Because not everyone has a good tooth and appetite like their~
	"Come on, go on, you're so 'great', man!" on the one hand, Ian Moore gives meat to Night.1, on the other hand, Ian Moore pours cola for Night.1.
	There is a scene like this in the barbecue soon: a soft and handsome child is drinking coke and brushing hot sauce on those kebabs. He has a good time and doesn’t show anything about the food. But the man opposite him has a red face, covering his mouth to show resistance, and he nods when he sees the kebab handed by the child.
	"It's not really spicy." Ian Moore says when he eats. There are many plates on the table, and most of them are eaten by Night.1. Ian Moore eats very little.
	Because Mommy says that he can't eat this kind of thing much.
	... But you still let Night.1 eat a lot.
	"Night.1, are you ok?" Ian Moore looks at Night.1 with his big eyes. Night.1 has a red face, which looks very bad. Thus Ian Moore is absolutely comforting.
	"The barbecue and hot sauce in this restaurant are absolutely adjusted to your taste." Bruce Hill leads Duke Field into the barbecue restaurant. Duke Field almost wants to eat the barbecue immediately when he smells the fragrance of the barbecue.
	"If it's not spicy, you should treat me today.” Duke Field says as he looks around. It's night now. There are many people coming here to eat barbecue, so he has to find a better place.
	"No problem. There's a place there. "
	Duke Field nods, and then he walks to a corner where no one sat with Bruce Hill.
	"I'll order some delicious food. You'll wait for me here." After Bruce Hill finished speaking, he walks to the other end. Duke Field sits there, and the environment is very quiet.
	It has to be said that sometimes it's just a coincidence.
	It's a coincidence that you are unprepared.
	Ian Moore eats the last one without politeness. He takes a sip of cola, leans back comfortably, and squints at the other place.
	"I'm full. I'm full."
	Night.1 looks at the plate beside him silently, and then he looks at Ian Moore's tiny bulging belly. He is surprised, how could this baby eat so much food?
	"Night one, do you still want to eat?" Ian Moore looks at him and then asks.
	Hearing this, Night.1 nods immediately, "Of course not, Night.1 does not want to eat these things."
	He could feel that his tongue is numb when he speaks.
	Ian Moore presses his lips and looks at him sadly. "That's a pity."
	He still wants to eat with him next time.
	Think of here, Ian Moore picks a napkin up to clean his mouth. He is about to throw it into the garbage can. But something bad happened to him. The foot of the chair suddenly turns, and the whole person rushes to the ground.
	"Young master!" Seeing that Ian Moore has fallen, Night.1 immediately goes to help him.
	Their location is very close to the seat of Duke Field, and it's quiet here, so Duke Field immediately looks at them.
	"Well." Ian Moore 'rubs' his little nose, which has turned red. But what he cares more is, "Night.1, isn't this nose crooked? Am I handsome? "
	As soon as he turns his head, he is right in front of Duke Field. His big eyes are pathetic, but other people will never believe that the reason he cries is for pain. It seems that he is verifying whether his handsome face is destroyed or not.
	But Duke Field could not believe this suddenly. Ian Moore looks like Dan William.
	He stands up with a fast breath. He could not believe that the face of Ian Moore he sees.
	They grow up together with Jamie Moore and Dan William. On one knows more about Dan Moore’s appearance than he and Bruce Hill!
	Ian Moore's face is the original of Dan William when he was a child!
	They look like the one person!
	Duke Field walks up uncontrollably to Ian Moore, and then he squats down and looks at him.
	Night.1 looks at Duke Field cautiously. But he knows that Duke Field would not hurt Ian Moore, so he does not stop.
	Ian Moore claps his hands. He is as clean as Dan William, but he is still small and the level is not very heavy. When he turns his head, he sees a handsome uncle looking at him like a man who can't see anything else. He is suspicious.
	"What can I do for you?" Ian Moore smiles gracefully and he looks as impeccable as a little gentleman.
	Hearing Ian Moore’s voice, Duke Field gets his sense. But the wave flashed in his eyes. "Uncle just thinks that you look like a friend of me… Who is your father?"
	Oh! Ian Moore suddenly realizes that this uncle should find that he is very similar to his father. Since he says he looks like a friend of him, he must know something of his father?
	"What’s up?" Ian Moore doesn't answer in a positive way. He looks at Duke Field calmly. If other child suffers this thing, he would be very fright.
	Duke Field also feels that he is a bit abrupt, but when he sees the face of Ian Moore, he could not help but think more.
	But if he doesn't know Dan William, he would think that the child in front of him is Dan William’s child. In recent years, Dan William always keeps clean, and he never have other interaction with other women.
	He even has an impulse to take Ian Moore to do DNA identification with Dan William in his heart.
	"We should leave now." Seeing that Ian Moore is a little embarrassment, Night.1 says. He takes the hand of Ian Moore in hand and then walks out.
	"Wait..." Duke Field losses his temper for the first time. He gets up and wants to catch up with him, but he is stopped by Bruce Hill, who comes back from ordering a meal. "Where are you going? Aren’t you eating anything? "
	"What else can you do besides eating?" Duke Field looks at Bruce Hill with a grudge. "Do you know who I just saw?"
	"I'm still hungry..." Bruce Hill presses his lips. Then he looks at Duke Field curiously, "Who? Altman or the little monster?”
	Duke Field feels very angry, and then he says calmly, "I see a child who looks like our brother very much."
	"Where? Where? I must go to have a look! " Bruce Hill looks around excitedly.
	"He leaves when you are coming." Duke Field walks to the position after saying this word. If Bruce Hill does not run out suddenly, he will able to find the family of that child. It's a pity.
Chapter 94 Whose Child Are You?
	Suddenly, Duke Field is shocked when he thinks of something. He remembers that he sees that child when he sends Wendy back that day!
	Ian Moore holds Night.1’s hands and then walks to Pennies House. After entering the main door of the apartment, Ian Moore releases Night.1 hand. Night.1 hides himself in the dark place. Ian Moore walks into the elevator with his hands in his stomach.
	When the elevator reaches the floor, Ian Moore steps out with his short leg, he holds the key in his hand and then walks into the house, and opens the door with the key.
	Mummy is right. One can't eat too much at night, or he'll be very tired.
	Ian Moore only feels that he is full. Fortunately, mummy is not here, or he should be spanked.
	With a click, Ian Moore opens the door and walks in.
	He turns on the light, puts on his slippers in the porch and the goes into the living room. He does not find two pairs of "women's" and men's shoes in the porch. Because he has just eaten too much and there is still a salty taste in his mouth, Ian Moore walks to the water dispenser to drink water, and then he is ready to go back to his room.
	"Well?" Stopping at the door of Jamie Moore’s room, he finds that the door is opened. The soft warm light is pouring out from the door. Ian Moore suddenly feels very happy.
	Mommy's back!
	"Mommy!" Ian Moore is so excited that he cried out crisply. Then he runs into Jamie Moore's room happily with his short legs.
	But when he sees the people in the room, Ian Moore little face is shocked suddenly. He presses his lips violently.
	Just like him, Dan William, who sits beside Jamie Moore and looks at Jamie Moore, suddenly hears a voice-mommy?
	When he turns back, he sees Ian Moore's soft and lovely face, and his frozen body, he stares at him motionless.
	Dan William only feels that his breath is sluggish. At this time, Ian Moore doesn’t wear sunglass, and his face exposed in the air. And Dan William has thinking this face for a long time.
	The little boy in the cake shop.
	Who did he call Mommy? Jamie Moore!
	Ian Moore sees that Dan William’s face changed, and he quickly responds, "I'm sorry, I enter the wrong room…"
	He immediately turns around and runs out of the door.
	Bunny, bunny, how can he appear here? Ian Moore's heart at this moment is extremely confused.
	"Wait!" Dan William immediately stands up and walks to the door with his legs. How could Ian Moore pass him quickly? He is grabbed by the collar and comes back.
	"I say that I am wrong. What do you want?" Ian Moore blinks his eyes and looks at him pitifully.
	It's a pity that this action works well for Jamie Moore, but it's a little bit worse for Dan William.
	"Who is your father?" Dan William puts Ian Moore on the ground and looks at him carefully.
	Now, he does not believe that Ian Moore enters the wrong room. If Ian Moore’s words are true, why does he walk into the door of Jamie Moore’s room?
	Dan William is sure that Ian Moore is his own child.
	However, he seems unwilling to recognize himself, or he even escapes from him!
	Dan William looks excitedly. He looks Ian Moore as if he finds a new life.
	Ian Moore can't bear it. He listens to Mommy’s word, and he doesn't let daddy know his existence. Even though he wants to have daddy like other children.
	All of a sudden, Ian Moore looks around with his big eyes. Looking at the Jamie Moore who is still sleep on the bed, Jamie Moore softly, "My name is Ian Moore. I'm four years old, and Jamie Moore is my mommy."
	Mommy, I’m not disobedient. Baby just tells daddy that baby is your son, but baby does not that baby is daddy's son.
	If Jamie Moore is awake at the moment, she will definitely hit his little butt. He is so good at chicanery.
	Ian Moore, four and a half years old, Jamie Moore is his mommy!
	He is really his son!
	Ian Moore is a little nervous, he holds his hands tightly. He thinks in his heart that if Dan William does not recognize him and Mommy, he would take mommy to France to seek refuge with his uncle!
	Although Dan William is calm, His eyes were red. He tries all his efforts to suppress the storm mood in his heart, and he looks at Ian Moore, then he says, "I'm your daddy."
	Ian Moore's fluttering heart immediately drops. He smiles at Dan William cunningly, "I don't admit that you are my daddy, and my mommy does not tell me that I had a daddy."
	Jamie Moore, this damned woman.
	Dan William has some resent to Jamie Moore. She is pregnant, but she still goes to abroad. She even does not tell all of this to him for so many years.
	Think of here, he pulls Ian Moore to the bed of Jamie Moore. Looking at the sleeping face of Jamie Moore, he is a little angry.
	What does this woman tell you? Dead woman, is he dead?
	Ian Moore is dissatisfied. "She's my mommy!"
	Seeing that Ian Moore protects his mommy, Dan William knows that Ian Moore will stands at Jamie Moore’s side unconditionally.
	"What did your mommy tell you?" Dan William could not adapt to this name suddenly. But he does not have any resent to have a son suddenly. At the beginning, he doesn’t believe it, but now, he feels very happy.
	It seems that his heart has been filled up.
	"Mummy said that I am born from a watermelon. In order to cut the big watermelon, mummy waits for ten months to wait for Ian Moore to come out. Ian Moore's father is the watermelon seed." Ian Moore recites the concept that Jamie Moore tells him fluently. He says all of this seriously, which make people laugh.
	Dan William presses his lips. Is he born from the watermelon? Does the woman have watermelons in her head?
	"Do you believe it?"
	Ian Moore nods, "I will believe everything that mommy told me, and mommy even has photos."
	"Photos?" A bad feeling spread in Dan William's mind.
	"A series of photos that baby coming from the watermelon." Ian Moore blinks. Although he wants to call him Daddy, he won't recognize him so easily until Mommy agrees.
	Besides, he should pay for the price that bullies mommy before.
	Ian Moore is sure that daddy will like him, and daddy will not abandon him.
	"..." Dan William does not say anything. He looks at Ian Moore carefully, as if he wants to see all the things that he doesn’t see enough in these years. He even feels magic in his heart.
	Is this his son?
	Is this really his son?
Chapter 95 Does he Want to Have a Son in Such an Easy Way?
	Suddenly, he stands up and walks out.
	Ian Moore doesn’t ask him anything. Anyone will be shock when he knows he has a son suddenly. Ian Moore looks at Jamie Moore, and he is ready to watch this play.
	20 minutes later, Dan William walks into the room. Then he sits beside Ian Moore. Ian Moore could smell the fragrance of tobacco on his body, which is not very strong, and which is very soft, so it would not be very unpleasant.
	Ian Moore sniffs and then he stays away from Dan William. "You can't smoke where there are children!"
	Dan William’s face changes, and then he looks at Ian Moore, "Daddy will not do this again."
	Now what he needs to do is make Ian Moore takes him as his daddy. And then he will clean up Jamie Moore!
	"Hum, you're not my daddy." Ian Moore hums and he is proud of this.
	Dan William’s face becomes dark, and then he says, “Why?”
	"It’s you that abandon mommy and me in the past. Do you want to have a son in such an easy way? It would not be so easy."
	Dan William is a little surprised. He wants to ask something, but he sees Jamie Moore opens her eyes. She doesn’t know that how dangerous she is now.
	She stretches her body under the quit, and then she rubs her hair and sits up. Then she stretches herself.
	Ian Moore looks at her Mommy pitifully, and then he looks at Dan William. Mommy, Mommy, don't be abused too badly by daddy.
	"Jamie Moore." Dan William says in a low voice. Jamie Moore suddenly gets her sense after hearing Dan William’s voice.
	"What?" Jamie Moore smiles and then she looks at Dan William. Then she finds something bad.
	What does she see?
	How could her son be with Dan William?
	"What’s the matter...?" Jamie Moore is a little stunned, and her heart clenched like a missed beat.
	"What's the matter? This is what I want to ask." Dan William looks at her coldly. She is in a panic. Doesn’t she want him to know the truth?
	Dan William feels very happy that he accompanies Jamie Moore back here tonight, or he may never know the secret. Jamie Moore hides Ian Moore in such a good way!
	Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore, and then she pulls Ian Moore to her in a panic way. And then she hugs Ian Moore in her arm to protect him, and then she says, “He is my son, and he has no relationship with you!”
	Dan William smiles suddenly, and then he looks at her sarcastically. "Now, Jamie Moore, what else do you want to cover up?"
	His satirical words hurt Jamie Moore heavily, and Jamie Moor feels very pain in her heart.
	"Give me the child." Dan William stretches out his hand and looks at her coldly. Suddenly, he feels that all the things he did in the past are just a joke.
	She gives birth to his child, but she never mentions this since she returns to China, and she even never wants him to know the truth.
	Is he so bad? So she doesn’t want him to know this is his child.
	"I have told you that he has no relationship with you!” Jamie Moore is out of control. She hugs Ian Moore tightly, thus Ian Moore frowns with pain.
	Mommy... It's rare for mommy to get out of control, but it's all about him.
	"How dare you say that he has no relationship with me? He has already admitted it. Should I take him to do the appraisal now?" Dan William grabs Ian Moore's hand and then he says coldly.
	Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore who is in her arm. The baby has already known the truth. Right. They look like each other, so she can’t hide it for a long time.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore looks at him warily. "I can give you anything but him."
	"If I say I only want this child?" Dan William holds Ian Moore’s hand tightly. He presses his lips and it seems that he never take her on his heart.
	Ian Moore turns to look at Dan William in a complicated way. What should he do? It seems that Daddy doesn’t hate him at all. But Daddy’s attitude toward mommy is so bad, which make him not sure that he could have Daddy and Mommy at the same time.
	"Don't think about it! As long as I'm here, you can never take him away!" Jamie Moore calms down, and her hands are full of sweat. But she still looks at Dan William with a stubborn face and she doesn’t give in.
	As for her, Ian Moore is all of her life. Anyone could not take Ian Moore away from her!
	Seeing this, Ian Moore reminds the life in England. In order to protect him, Mommy did the thing in the same way. She fights with that bad man, and finally she is covered with scars and shed a lot of blood. She even can’t go to the hospital, and all of this is to prevent those people from taking him away.
	But now the scene has changed, and the people have changed. But Ian Moore’s minds have not changed. What he loves and adores most is his mommy.
	It seems that his mommy is very weak, but when the thing endangers the people she loved, his mommy will change to another woman, and she will do everything thing in a ruthlessness way.
	However, although Ian Moore loves Mommy, he doesn't want the relationship between his parents to be so stalemate, so he has to find a way.
	"Hum." Dan William snorts coldly. He knocks on Jamie Moore's arm. Somehow, Jamie Moore feels that her arm is paralyzed and she lets go her hands suddenly.
	Dan William gently picks up Ian Moore, and then takes him out of Jamie Moore's arms. Then he looks at Jamie Moore and says, "You could come to me when you think well."
	"Dan William!" Jamie Moore's hands are paralyzed. She can't stand up on the bed. Thus she can only watch Dan William leaves with Ian Moore in his arms.
	You bastard!
	Jamie Moore is very angry, but she can't move her arm. But she is certain that Dan William won't do anything bad to Ian Moore. Anyway, Ian Moore is his child!
	Now, Jamie Moore can only place her bets.
	"Don't let me see you again!" Jamie Moore feels not good due to the numbness of her arm. She feels pain in her body, and one could not imagine that feeling.
	Dan William puts Ian Moore in the front passenger seat, and then he fastens his seat belt. Then he lowers the temperature in the car, and then he divers away.
	Seeing that Dan William does such wonderful actions, he feels very warm, but he can't show it.
	"Mommy will be sad." Ian Moore says. It looks that he is like an adult.
	Dan William looks at Ian Moore, and then says, "Will she be sad? She is so cold, how could she be sad?"
	"Mommy is not that kind of person. She loves me very much." Seeing that Dan William says something bad of Jamie Moore, Ian Moore is not very happy.
	
Chapter 96 Young Master, Welcome to the Home
	Dan William listens to Ian Moore. This feeling is very wonderful. Ian Moore stays beside him. It seems that all his actions could affect his heart. He can't calm down for a moment.
	At that moment, it’s him who comes later, thus he doesn’t save Jamie Moore.
	"How has your mommy been those years?" Dan William presses his lips, and then he suddenly regrets what he had done to Jamie Moore.
	Ian Moore raises his chin proudly and then he looks out of the window and says, “It’s not bad.”
	He will never say that Jamie Moore lives a bad life. He doesn’t want Dan William to think that Jamie Moore is a woman of affectation.
	But Dan William knows. At that time, Jamie Moore is pregnant, and she lives abroad alone. How could she live well abroad? Will the Moore Family take care of her abroad? Of course not.
	But he doesn’t understand this. If he knows that Jamie Moore is pregnant, he would never let her leave, and he will let her stay with him.
	Does he like a person who will abandon his son?
	Or it should be said that Jamie Moore never believes him.
	Dan William feels very sad and upset.
	The next day, in Dan William's private manor. Because they come back later, thus Dan William urges Ian Moore to sleep with him for one night. He doesn’t care whether Ian Moore agrees or not, and he wants to cultivating feeling with Ian Moore.
	But early in the morning, when Ian Moore is still in sleep, he is woken up by the noise outside. This is the sound of the car, and the car drives around the manor all the time. Even though Ian Moore has a good temper, he can't stand it.
	"It’s too noisy!" Ian Moore pulls his head out of the quilt and complains.
	Dan William, who has been awake for a long time, is watching Ian Moore's sleeping face. He just thinks that the child's sleeping appearance is lovely, but then his thinking is interrupted by the complaint voice.
	Sound?
	Dan William looks at the time. It's already 10:30. Usually, he has got up and walks in the company. But today is different. Today Ian Moore is here.
	What's more, the sound of the car is always loud, but the car patrol in his absence, so he doesn’t have this feeling.
	Think of here, he stands up gently, and then he walks to the window and pulls out the golden curtain, and then he opens the window. Seeing that the car patrols outside the window, he frowns, "Who let you patrol at this time? Today, you should stop patrolling for one day. Little Young master is having rest, don’t disturb him.
	The patrol team is not clear about the situation, because the young master is no longer in the manor at this time. Moreover, it’s younger master who orders them to patrol the manor every day, and this rule has never been broken.
	What's more, little young master? When does the young master have child?
	The captain of the patrol is a little confused, but he still says, "Yes, young master." Then he leaves with several other patrol cars.
	Finally, the sound gradually disappears. Then Dan William walks back to the bedroom. He closes the window and draws the curtain in a good way. In this way, the sunshine could penetrate from the outside, and people in the room will not feel dazzling.
	Ian Moore couldn't fall sleep after he is woken up. In addition, usually he has already got up to make breakfast in the apartment at this time. So he wants to get up to make breakfast for Jamie Moore, but he finds that the layout here is totally different from his nest.
	Then Ian Moore finds that this is his daddy’s home, and he is abducted by daddy last night.
	"Are you awake?" Seeing that Ian Moore awake, Dan William smiles and then he asks.
	"Yes." Ian Moore is a bit awkward. Before that, he is approaching him as a stranger. Ian Moore never thinks this is awkward, but now Dan William knows he is his son, so he feels very awkward.
	"You can brush your teeth now." Dan William beckons to him, and then he takes Ian Moore into the bathroom.
	Ian Moore stands beside Dan William. He is only at the thigh of Dan William, and he can just see himself in the mirror on the washstand.
	His face reflects in the mirror, which is tender and smart. Compared with the face of Dan William, it is a sharp contrast. However, the temperament is just like the same. It’s full of dignity and elegance, as if all is given by God.
	In this way, it's really amazing. As the saying goes, a child looks like their parents when they were young. This saying is true.
	Although Jamie Moore doesn’t come back five years ago, she sees Ian Moore who has the same with Dan William every day, so it’s very hard for her to forget him.
	"Take it." Dan William squeezes the toothpaste for Ian Moore and then hands toothbrush and cup to him. These are all spare. He doesn’t have time for the servant to prepare the new one, so he uses it first and he plans to take Ian Moore to buy the thing they need.
	It’s right. Dan William plans to let Ian Moore lives in the manor. As for Jamie Moore, he has way to persuade her.
	Ian Moore takes the toothbrush and then starts to brush his teeth.
	It’s very quiet in the bathroom. They could only hear the sound of brushing teeth and water.
	Dan William looks at Ian Moore who is brushing his teeth conscientiously. He is very satisfied.
	He has always thought that children are very troublesome, so he never thinks about having a child, even when he stays with Jamie Moore.
	Until that day when he sees Ian Moore in the cake shop, he changes his mind. It is the first time that he wants to have a child--A child that belongs to Jamie Moore and himself.
	But he never thinks that this child is his son. He is so lucky, and that child is really his son.
	He once said that if he had a child, he would give him the best love in the world. Now that he has one, but he doesn't know what to do.
	Dan William knows that this child is different. From the previous conversation and the present performance, he knows that this child is not the kind of child who can only cry. He is as steady as an adult, but his face is very soft.
	In a word, Dan William likes him very much.
	After washing, Dan William takes Ian Moore to downstairs stiffly. He has never holds a child like this. And now he tries his best to do this.
	Cindy Swift and the servant are waiting in the restaurant. Seeing that Dan William walks downstairs, they all do the thing they needed to do. But when they see Dan William go downstairs with Ian Moore, their expression all changes. They can't believe it.
	
Chapter 97 I’m Your Father.
	It should to be said that Ian Moore's face is so powerful. Anyone who sees his face will be surprised.
	Seeing that all the servants is surprised. Dan William holds Ian Moore and then walks to the dining table. He asks the servant to bring a soft stool and then put it beside him. Then he lets Ian Moore sits on it.
	The servants can't believe it any more. Isn't the young master obsessed with cleanliness? How could he be willing to sit so close to a child? And how does this child look like a young master?
	"Cindy Swift." Dan William says in a low voice.
	"Young master." Cindy Sift presses down her doubts and answers.
	"Command all of the servants. From today on, this is your little young master. You should treat him as you treat me. All of you can’t neglect him. Understand?" His voice is cold and indifferent, but the momentum is as convincing as the king.
	"Yes." Cindy Swift dares not ask more questions, thus she answers.
	"Prepare a new breakfast for him, and the taste should be suit for the child. After seeing the breakfast on the table, Dan William orders.
	Ian Moore puffs his cheeks, and he is moved. He grabs Dan William's sleeve quickly. "It’s doesn’t matter, Mommy said it’s a" wave "action. I can eat anything."
	It's a pity to throw such a good food on table. If mommy sees all of this, she might jump up and beat him.
	Cindy Swift glances at Ian Moore more. Now he is just like an adult, and he is telling a truth to him. Anyone will like him.
	Dan William feels soft in his heart and then he nods, "OK."
	"Uncle, your house is so big." Ian Moore says as he breaks the bread. He is very smart, and he likes the quiet and spacious here.
	Hearing what Ian Moore calls, Dan William’s face become dark. But he is afraid that his action will fright Ian Moore, thus he says, "Does you like here? Do you want to live here all the time?"
	"Yes, but I want live here with mommy." Ian Moore is not so easy to be bribed. Mommy is the most important people in his heart.
	"It's very simple. You can stay here as long as your mommy agrees." Dan William says with smile, and his smiles could reveal all his nature.
	Ian Moore’s eyes lights up immediately, and then he looks at Dan William with disbelief, "Really?"
	"Yes." But what Dan William thinks is how to let Jamie Moore live with him. Jamie Moore is not a person who will give in easily, so he should let Ian Moore lives in the manor first. As long as Ian Moore lives in the manor, he has many ways to deal with Jamie Moore.
	"Mommy will be here soon." Ian Moore says firmly. He doesn’t see through his father’s idea. In his eyes, nothing is more important than the good relationship between mom and dad.
	Ian Moore continues to eat breakfast after saying these words. Then he suddenly reminds of something, and he says, “Uncle, I want to go to the bathroom..."
	“I’m your father!”
	The atmosphere between Ian Moore and Dan William is so harmonious, and they even plans to take Jamie Moore to live with them. As for Jamie Moore, she is sleeping. Usually, she will set a clock, but today, she turns off the alarm clock directly. She sleeps very well.
	This is very different from what Ian Moore thinks.
	In fact, Jamie Moore is sure that Dan William will never do bad thing to Ian Moore. In this case, they just want to cultivate their feelings with each other, and then she could pick Ian Moore up soon.
	The thinking is very wonderful, but the reality is very crucial.
	When she walks into the manor, she may can’t come out, let alone come out with Ian Moore.
	Even though Jamie Moore cheats Dan William for so long time, and he is dissatisfied with this, but love is a magic thing. The love will not decrease as time losses. He doesn’t forget Jamie Moore as the time goes by. What’s more, he loves Jamie Moore much than before. This shows that Jamie Moore is very important in his heart.
	But if there are misunderstandings between them, love is nothing. He is such a proud man, how can he low his head again.
	Sometimes, love is not connivance, especially for the myth that dominates the lives of ten thousand enterprise groups of Country C. Even if he is willing to do this, other people also need to accept it.
	He never feels that Jamie Moore could accept his connivance.
	Today is the day to work, but Jamie Moore decides to stay at home. She sleeps very well, and even the earthquake can’t wake her up.
	Like Jamie Moore, Dan William also doesn’t go to the work. He hands the work to Secretary Sam, and he plays with Ian Moore at home.
	Ian Moore and Dan William is planning how to trick Jamie Moore to live with them. However, Jamie Moore, who should care for Ian Moore, sleeps very well. And she doesn’t get up, even if the sun has hung highly in the sky.
	It wasn't until 3 p.m. that Jamie Moore gets up in a daze. The cell phone rings on the head cabinet of the bed for many times, and she doesn’t hear it.
	But Jamie Moore is very worried. Mommy doesn’t call him from morning to now. Does she meet any dangerous?
	They don’t receive the call from Jamie Moore until 3 p.m. Ian Moore and Dan William lean against the soft, and Dan William’s phone is put on the tale, but they never hear the ring.
	Cindy Swift walks to them with a fruit platter in her hand. She puts the platter on the table, and then leaves.
	But this is not her nature. She has been the housekeeper of the William Family for so many years. She abides herself very well. But now, she is really curious about who the child is. What about Miss Jamie?
	If Jamie Moore knows this, she must be very sad.
	Cindy Swift stays with Dan William and Jamie Moore when they are still young. Then they fall in love with each other, and they even get married. So she doesn’t have a good impression on the "women" outside. She thinks that Jamie should be the young lady of the William Family.
	But how could the young master have a son suddenly?
	All the servants in the manor have the same doubts about this. But no one dares to ask it, since Dan William doesn’t tell them anything.
	"Derek William has confirmed that she stays at home, so there's no danger. Don't worry." Dan William says with his eyes focusing on the phone.
	Silly woman, doesn’t she want to answer the phone?
	Ian Moore doesn’t say anything. He lowers his head, and he is thinking. Since Mommy doesn’t answer the phone, and she even stays at home, so there is only one reason.
	"Probably Mommy is still sleeping..." Ian Moore says firmly. He knows his mommy well. If she is awake, she must answer the phone. So the fact is she is sleeping, thus she doesn’t answer the phone.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he looks at the time. It’s four o'clock. Does she sleep for whole day? Why does she sleep so well?
	Jamie Moore can't fall asleep after she gets up. She goes into the bathroom to wash and change clothes. She doesn’t aware that it’s afternoon now. She goes out to eat something, and then she finds a question. Where is Ian Moore？
Chapter 98 I want to see you
	Jamie Moore rubs her hair, and then she suddenly reminds that Ian Moore has been taken away by Dan William. It seems that she can't eat the breakfast cooked by Ian Moore today.
	At this time, the mobile phone rings suddenly, accompanied by the vibration on the table buzzing.
	The caller ID is not Dan William. Jamie Moore looks at the screen, and she doesn’t know this number and then she says, "Hello?"
	"Jamie Moore." The voice at that end is warm. It's like a gentle breeze, which makes people feel warm. Jamie Moore is familiar with this voice.
	Jamie Moore’s eyes lights up, and then she smiles. She asks, “Are you Ryan Jack?”
	Ryan Jack could feel that Jaime Moore is in a good mood through the phone. Then he narrows his eyes, and puts the hand on his pocket. He stands at the airport, and he looks at the sky, it’s very bright, “Yes.”
	It’s obvious that Jamie Moore is very happy. Then she hears Ryan Jack’s voice, “I return to China.”
	"Really? I remember that you should stay there for another two years, am I right?” Jamie Moore knows something about the family background of Ryan Jack. He lives in a single family. He lives with his father alone. He stays in the Country C for a few years and then he goes to England. He quarrels with his father, and then he goes to England alone, but then he doesn’t want to return to Country C. so his father has no choice but to send someone to catch him.
	Jamie Moore meets Ryan Jack when Ryan Jack’s father sends someone to catch him. At that time, Chris Lockwood has already returned to France. Jamie Moore is afraid that Dan William would find them, so she refuses to return with Chris Lockwood. But when Chris Lockwood goes to France, those people who want to hurt them start their actions.
	Jamie Moore is graceful for Ryan Jack, and then they become good friend.
	"I have no choice. My father urges me to come back, so I come back.” Ryan Jack says in a helpless way, but he is little happy.
	"Do you have time? I want to see you." Ryan Jack says directly, but other people will not feel uncomfortable. They have known each other for so long time, so they are very family with each other. And they will not feel embarrassed.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t refuse him. And then she looks at the table, and says, "I'm more familiar with here than you are. Tonight, I'll invite you to the best restaurant I know."
	"Well, see you later." Ryan Jack says with smile and then he hangs up.
	At the moment, silver Rolls Royce stops in front of him. He pulls the car and then sits in the car. A man follows behind him.
	"Is it really good of you to deceive her like this?" That voice seems to be a little dissatisfied, and he says in a complaining way.
	Ryan Jack looks out of the window, and his eyes is very cold, “Are these important? I just need to get what I want. Drive."
	The man behind him wants to say something, but he gives up at last. He looks out of the window dully.
	After hanging the phone, Jamie Moore finds there are more than ten missed calls in the call record. All is the phone from Dan William. She rolls her eyes. She will find them when she thinks everything well. Why does he is more urgent than her?
	But the heaven could prove this. It’s Ian Moore who calls Jamie Moore with Dan William’s phone. Dan William wants Jamie Moore acts initially. But now in Jamie Moore’s eyes, he is in a hurry. Who should be responsible for this?
	"Mommy doesn’t answer the phone." Ian Moore is a little unhappy. Usually mommy will answer the phone within a few seconds, but now, Mommy doesn’t answer the phone.
	Is it because it's my dad's cell phone? Ian Moore holds the phone is his hand. This cell phone is very thin and the screen is very big, so he can't hold it in his hand. Then the phone falls on the ground.
	It’s so terrible...
	Ian Moore covers his mouth and looks at Dan William innocently. He doesn’t do this on purpose. Wouldn't Daddy beat him?
	Dan William picks the phone up calmly. He looks at the phone, and then he finds there are some small marks on it. Thus he throws the phone to the side, and says, “I can change a new one.”
	Does he throw the phone like this? Ian Moore blinks his eyes. OK. Daddy has money, and he could do this. He admires his daddy very much.
	If Night.1 hears this, they may bury Ian Moore with money. All of them have a rich family background. They are very rich. In addition, they hold the property leaves by the Gilbert Family. Although this property is only one percent, it would be enough for a man to spend a month. The heir of these things, of course, is Ian Moore who is their master now. He doesn’t need to envy anyone.
	Maybe Ian Moore doesn’t know that he has so much money...
	"Gululu " The sound come from Ian Moore’s stomach. The sound is not too loud, but Dan William hears the sound.
	Dan William presses his lips. He looks at the red face of Ian Moore, and then he stands up. He holds Ian Moore’s hand and then says, “Let’s go, I will take you to eat delicious food.”
	Ian Moore bites his lips, and his face is red. It’s very cute.
	"Old uncle, I know a wonderful place. I also eat with Mommy there..." Ian Moore said.
	Old uncle? Dan William feels embarrassed. He has turned from uncle to old uncle?
	"I have told you that I'm your daddy!" It’s Jamie Moore’s fault. If he catches her, he will let Ian Moore calls him daddy in front of her.
	...
	In the Red Leaf Restaurant. This restaurant is in a small alley. If you are not a native who lives in the Country C, you will never know this restaurant. As a foodie, Jamie Moore knows all the delicious food in the Country C. It should be said that she is truly foodie.
	The Red Leaf Restaurant is in the deepest part of this alley. It is unique in its position, but the environment is very quiet. Red leaf restaurant has been opened here for a long time since Jamie Moore remembers things. Although there are few people, it is very quiet.
	Jamie Moore likes to eat here.
	When Jamie Moore arrives at the restaurant, she finds that Ryan Jack is waiting there. Ryan Jack sits near the window. His temperament is outstanding. He is very handsome. The whole person is integrated with the scenery outside the window. It’s like a beautiful painting. His whole body are full of sunshine, and other people will feels warm when stay close to him. He is like Hooson. Even though he doesn’t speak anything, other people will feel very warm.
	Today, he wears white casual suit. It seems that he just like a reliable brother.
	Today, Jamie Moore also wears white lace dress. The cloth of upper body is tight, which reveals the good shape of her. He also wears a pleated skirt and a black short boots. She looks very pure and energetic.
	
Chapter 99 Daddy & Foster daddy
	Jamie Moore wears no make-up. Her eyes are big and bright, and her face is very delicate. In this way, Jamie Moore looks very beautiful.
	"Jamie Moore, come here." Ryan Jack beckons to her, and he smiles.
	Seeing Ryan Jack’s handsome face, Jamie Moore says with smile, “Ryan Jack, will you feel embarrassed when you look yourself in the mirror?”
	“Why did you say that?”
	"Won't you be fascinated with your face?" Jamie Moore sits opposite him, and then she teases Ryan Jack.
	Ryan Jack smiles, “Are you say that I’m handsome?”
	Jamie Moore smiles, “Of course.”
	If Dan William is a cold and handsome man, Ryan Jack must be a gentle and warm man.
	Hooson has the same temper with Ryan Jack, and he is truly a wonderful man in the eyes of other people.
	"Why do you come back? Does the company in the England go bankrupt? Jamie Moore asks casually as she puts the menu aside.
	Ryan Jack is drinking coffee, but he never thinks that Jamie Moore would ask him such a question. He is almost choked by this question. He swallows the coffee slowly and then smiles, "Yes, the company is closed, and I’m waiting for you to support me."
	"No problem. I have the ability to support you alone." Jamie Moore says with smile. She knows that Ryan Jack is joking with her, thus she also makes jokes with him.
	"By the way, where's Ian Moore?" Ryan Jack reminds the soft and round face of Ian Moore. He misses him very much. Seeing that Jamie Moore doesn’t take Ian Moore to here, he asks, “Why doesn't he come with you?"
	Ian Moore has taken Ryan Jack as his foster daddy in the England. Except Jamie Moore and Chris Lockwood, Ryan Jack loves Ian Moore most. Ryan Jack is very important in Ian Moore’s heart. When he was young, he always wants to take Ryan Jack as his daddy.
	Jamie Moore blinks her eyes and then says, "Ian Moore is at home. I'll bring him to see you next time. He also says that he misses you every day."
	But she is not sure the time. Maybe he should wait for the day when Dan William sends Ian Moore back. Jamie Moore thinks in her heart, and she doesn’t feel that the danger is approaching to her.
	"Mommy!" Jamie Moore hears a familiar voice when she is thinking. It’s true that the voice come from Ian Moore.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. It’s true that no one could tell lie to others. Otherwise, even cowhide can’t mend it when other people know this.
	Ian Moore’s eyes lights up, and then he says, “It's really Mommy!" He wants to let go of Dan William's hand and runs to Jamie Moore, but Dan William hold him quickly.
	Ian Moore looks at him doubtfully. He sees that Dan William winks at him calmly, and then Ian Moore understands him immediately. He follows behind Dan William to the table where Jamie Moore is.
	"Ian Moore." Although Ryan Jack is curious about the lie of Jamie Moore, he doesn’t tear it down.
	"Foster father!" Ian Moore suddenly notices Ryan Jack who sits beside Jamie Moore. Thus he shakes off Dan William’s hand and rushes to Ryan Jack.
	Dan William's face becomes dark. Ian Moore knows that he is his father, but he calls another man father. And he even rushes to this man, thus he feels very upset.
	"What a coincidence!" Jamie Moore doesn’t expect that Dan William would have lunch with Ian Moore here, thus she feels upset.
	“What a coincidence?” Dan William looks at her coldly, and his eyes are full of dangerous, “It’s really coincidence.”
	So the reason she doesn’t answer the phone is that she is having lunch with this man. It’s good. It seems that she really enjoys her life recently.
	Jamie Moore shrinks her neck and then she suddenly losses her courage. Compared with courage, it's more important to keep her life in front of Dan William.
	"Who is he?" Ryan Jack looks at Dan William with smile, and his eyes become deeper than before.
	This man should be the father of Ian Moore.
	Ryan Jack knows the identity of Dan William at the first sight.
	"Foster father, this is my daddy." Ian Moore walks to Dan William and holds Dan William’s hand, and then he introduces Dan William to Ryan Jack. This action comforts Dan William a little.
	Jamie Moore feels very fright, and she holds Jamie Moore in his arm with a bad expression. “My baby, how could you be bribed by Dan William in such a short time?”
	"Hello, my name is Ryan Jack." Ryan Jack stands up and then he shakes hands with Dan William politely. "I’m Bunny’s foster father."
	Bunny? Dan William notices Ryan Jack’s address toward Ian Moore. Then he looks at Ian Moore. The face in front of him coincides with Night.1’s brother that night.
	"I’m Dan William, and I’m Ian Moore’s father."
	Dan William narrows his eyes, and then he also shakes hands with Ryan Jack
	He feels that he is a very familiar with this man
	But they are two people who have different personality.
	Ian Moore looks at Dan William doubtfully. He never tells Dan William his true name. How could daddy know this?
	"Mr. William, I've heard a lot about your reputation, and I need your support in the future." Ryan Jack sits down gracefully. It seems that he plans to stay in country C for a long time.
	"Of course." Dan William nods, and then he sits beside Jamie Moore. Ian Moore sits between Jamie Moore and Dan William. From any aspect, they are a wonderful family.
	"Is Mr. William really Bunny’s father?" Ryan Jack looks at Ian Moore who is eating food in his plate, and then he asks.
	"Mr. Jack, what's the matter? Is there any problem?" Dan William overlaps legs, no one knows his thinking, and he asks in a cold voice. Jamie Moore, who sits beside him, pretends that she doesn’t hear anything, and she keeps eating food in her plate.
	I know that Jamie Moore lives in the England with Bunny alone, so where are you during that time? Ryan Jack withdraws his eyes, and then he looks at Dan William and asks.
	Ryan Jack never thinks the appearance of Dan William, so he is caught unprepared.
	Jamie Moore never mentioned anything about Ian Moore’s father in the England. He thought that Ian Moore doesn’t have father or his father has died.
	He loves Jamie Moore, but he will never force Jamie Moore to do anything she doesn’t want to do. He stays beside quietly. Even though she has a child, he doesn’t care about it.
	Dan William's appearance brings him an unprecedented sense of crisis, which means that Jamie Moore will return back to Dan William, and then they will live a happy life together.
	"I don't need to explain to you what happened before, but I would like to thank Mr. Jack for taking care of them in the past." Dan William says with smile. Seeing that there is something at the corner of Jamie Moore’s mouth, he wipes it for her intimately and vaguely.
	Jamie Moore's face turns red suddenly. She even couldn’t remind Dan William’s words, and she just lowers down her head and pokes at the rice in her bowl.
Chapter 100 Stop talking and kissing me
	Dan William must have done it on purpose!
	Ryan Jack’s eyesight becomes dark, and then he smiles at Jamie Moore. He picks up the chopsticks on the table, and puts a piece of braised spareribs in Jamie's bowl. "Jamie, you love it."
	He calls Jamie again.
	Dan William’s face becomes dark. How could he call Jamie?
	Thus he also picks up the chopsticks, and squeezes out the braised pork ribs that Ryan Jack had just put into the bowl. "Sorry, there are still scars on her body, thus she can't eat such greasy food."
	Are you hurt? Ryan Jack frowns, but he doesn’t speak anything, and then he puts some green vegetables into Jamie Moore's bowl.
	And this time, Dan William holds the vegetable with chopstick and then throws it into an empty bowl, “Sorry. There's garlic in it, and Jamie Moore hates the smell of garlic."
	"Well? Mr. William really understands Jamie Moore well." Ryan Jack looks at the dishes on the table and he puts his chopsticks towards the plate of stewed chicken and mushrooms.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then says, “Jamie Moore hates mushrooms most. She will not eat anything related to mushrooms. It seems that Mr. Jack really doesn't understand Jamie Moore."
	The last sentence—our Jamie, is full of affairs.
	Ian Moore smiles as he hears the dialogue. He looks at Jamie Moore and he finds Jamie Moore focus on eating, and she even doesn’t hear the dialogue of Dan William and Ryan Jack. Ian Moore feels embarrasses.
	“Mommy, how could you just focus on eating when daddy is so man?” Although Ryan loves Mommy, he always supports his father!
	For him, it’s the best that Mommy and Daddy stay together!
	"So does Mr. William understand Jamie Moore well?” Ryan Jack asks seriously, and then he puts the chopsticks down, and then he takes up his coffee and tastes it slowly.
	"Mr. Jack is so smart. Do you still need my answer?" Dan William asks coldly. He holds his chin with his hand. He sits in a lazy way, which is very elegant.
	“Mr. William, you think too high of me.” Ryan Jack raises his cup to him, and then he drinks.
	"You're welcome." Dan William takes the coffee in front of him and then takes a sip.
	It's said that the war between women will surely bring countless deaths and injuries, while the lethality of men's war, even if there is no smoke and death, is also high.
	However, the woman who causes this war is eating happily.
	"Ah." Jamie Moore is eating heartlessly, and suddenly she feels a pain in her waist. Thus she couldn't help shouting.
	She looks down, and she finds Dan William’s hand is on her waist. It’s him who grabs her right now.
	Jamie Moore smiles at Ryan Jack regrettably, and then she takes a napkin and wipes her lips. Then she stands up. "Excuse me; I'll go to the bathroom. You'll have it first."
	"Well, OK." Ryan Jack smiles at her and then nods understandably.
	Jamie Moore walks out of their sight calmly, and then she touches the place where she feels pain. It’s really painful.
	“Do I offend him?” Jamie Moore thinks, and then she goes into the bathroom.
	She goes to the washstand in the bathroom and then she looks at herself in the mirror. Her cheeks are slightly red and her lips are also red. Maybe she had eaten too much spicy food, thus her lips are red.
	She puts her hand under the sensitive faucet and then she slowly rubs her hands. She feels very comfortable when she touches the water.
	Jamie Moore withdraws her hands a few minutes later. She draws a tissue to wipe her hand. However, she suddenly finds the gloomy handsome face behind her.
	Jamie Moore is so scared that she even doesn’t hold the tissue. The tissue falls on the ground and then she looks at Dan William.
	"Dan William, is this the bathroom for woman?"
	Dan William snorts and then he says. "I'd like to."
	Jamie Moore presses he lips. OK. Since you loves enter this bathroom, you can. No one dares to say something about you, even if you want to come here to go to the toilet.
	"You can do everything. I'll go first." Jamie Moore says with smile. But her face is stiff and she even could not laugh at all.
	"Do I agree?" Dan William blocks her way, and he stares at Jamie Moore. it seems that he wants to find something from Jamie Moore’s face.
	But he finds nothing.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore is in a bad mood, and she feels painful. This is the bathroom for woman. Even he doesn’t want face, she wants it.
	"Stop talking." Dan William presses his lips and then he rubs her hair.
	When Jamie Moore hears this, she says suddenly, "Kiss me!"
	Dan William’s eyesight lights up, and then he smiles, and then he kisses Jamie Moore.
	His lips are not hot as usual, and it’s even a little cold, which is a sharp contrast with Jamie Moore.
	This is the first time for Jamie Moore to do such a thing, so Dan William feels very happy.
	Dan William kisses Jamie Moore heavily, and he describes her lips in detail. When Jamie Moore loses her mind, Dan William kisses her more heavily than before.
	Jamie Moore only wants to strangle herself. She just takes the second half of the sentence, "Stop talking, and kissing me." She doesn’t want him to kiss her!
	For other people, one single slip brings eternal regret, but for her, one single word brings eternal pain.
	Even so, Jamie Moore doesn't hate the kiss. Instead, she even expects this kiss. Her heart jumps as if it is about to jump out, but the reaction of her is very raw.
	Dan William kisses Jamie Moore for a long time. When Dan William let Jamie Moore go, she even can’t stand. If she doesn’t lean against the wall, she will sit on the cold floor directly.
	Dan William leans over, and then he holds Jamie Moore’s chin. He smiles happily and says, "Are you satisfied with this kiss, Jamie?"
	Jamie Moore’s face becomes redder than before. Her eyes are full of misty, and she bites her lips, and then she turns her head away.
	"Since you don’t say anything, you are satisfied with this kiss."
	"Who told you that? When did I let you kiss me?" Jamie Moore is ashamed and angry. She hammers Dan William's shoulder hardly. In Dan William's eyes, she is coquettish and lovely. The handsome face of Dan William reflects in Jamie Moore’s eyes. Her checks are very red, which is very attractive.
	Dan William smiles happily, ad he looks at Jamie Moore with tenderness and doting eyesight, but Jamie Moore, who is very angry, doesn’t find this. “You said that right now. You ask me to kiss you. Am I wrong when I meet your requirement?"
	Garrulous!
	Jamie Moore stares at Dan William, and then she says, “You kiss me when I ask you to kiss me, are you so obedient? If I sell you to other, do you agree?”
	It’s obvious that Dan William wants to play the women. But he says in such a firm way. She doesn’t believe it.
	Dan William smiles. When other people see the handsome face of Dan William, they will lose their mind.
	He seldom smiles like this. The silly woman in front of him has seen all kinds of smile of him.
	"I agree. If I was sold to you, I can count the money for you."
	"You!" Jamie Moore is so angry that she even couldn't speak. She stares at Dan William, and she even wants to strangle him.
Chapter 101 Combat Plan
	"Me? You take my son abroad secretly. I haven't count this thing with you yet. So now do you want to fight with me? Dan William holds Jamie Moore’s chin, thus Jamie Moore has to look at him. He smiles in an evil way. He asks in a lazy way, which is just like an elegant and proud cat.
	What does he mean? When does she run with his son?
	Hearing Dan Williams words, Jamie Moore rolls her eyes, “You feel so good about yourself."
	"I've always been like that, otherwise how can I make you pregnant once?" Dan William says with a kind of provocative meaning.
	"Dan William! Stop talking! " Jamie Moore's face is red and she kicks toward Dan William in his crotch.
	However, Dan William dodges the attack lightly and easily. He lets Jamie Moore’s hand go, thus Jamie Moore has a chance to kick Dan William. She pushes Dan William aside, and then runs out.
	She should have known that Dan William is shameless.
	Does he feel so proud for her pregnant? If he has the ability, he can’t give a birth to the child himself!
	When Jamie Moore returns to the seat, she is not calm. When she sees the smile on Ryan Jack’s face, she feels very warm gradually.
	Ryan Jack has such ability. His smile seems full of ability to warm other people’s mood.
	This is one of the reasons why Jamie Moore and Ryan Jack become friends. Dan William could give her a sense of security, but what Ryan Jack brings to her is happiness and pleasure.
	Jamie Moore smiles at Ryan Jack, and then she says, “ Ryan, if you have a wife, she must be very happy.”
	Ryan Jack pauses for a while, and then he looks at Jamie Moore and says seriously, “Why did you say that?”
	"Because your smile is very contagious." Jamie Moore answers truthfully. Then she drinks the water at hand.
	Ryan Jack’s eyesight becomes dark. If she is that person, he will make her happier.
	"This has no relationship with the happiness of his wife, am I right? Bunny.”
	Dan William walks toward them with his hand in the pocket. He walks over Jamie Moore and Ian Moore, and then he sits in the inside position. And then he rubs Ian Moore’s hair.
	"Mr. William, what did you mean?" Ryan Jack knows that Dan William has opinions on him. If it is not for Jamie Moore and Ian Moore, he also has opinions on Dan William.
	They have regarded each other as enemies subconsciously.
	"Whether his wife is happy or not, this should depend on Mr. Jack own ability. Jamie Moore, am I right?" Dan William looks at Jamie Moore with a smile.
	Well, now here is full of the strong smell of gunpowder, thus Ian Moore covers his nose.
	This guy! Jamie Moore bites her lips and then she looks at Ryan Jack. She hopes that he doesn’t put Dan William’s words on the heart.
	Ryan Jack doesn’t speak anything. The phone rings at the right time, which breaks the silence for a moment. He smiles at Jamie Moore apologetically and then answers the phone.
	It seems that the call is from the company in the UK. He replies in English and then hangs up.
	"I'm sorry. Jamie Moore, Bunny. There is something bad with my company. Please eat first. I'll invite you another day." Ryan Jack ignores Dan William directly and then he says to Jamie Moore and Ian Moore.
	"It doesn't matter. You can do your own thing now." Jamie Moore smiles and she waves to him to show that she doesn’t care this.
	"Goodbye, foster father. Remember to see me next time." Ian Moore also waves his hand to him. He relieves. He is worried that his foster father would be attacked by his father. After all, compared with his father's talking skills, his foster father can’t reach his ability.
	"No problem."
	As soon as Ryan Jack leaves, the smile on Dan William’s face disappears suddenly. He looks at Jamie Moore, which make Jamie Moore shivers.
	"You, what do you want to do?" Jamie Moore feels nervous, and then she moves toward Ian Moore. She hugs Ian Moore. When necessary, she still needs Ian Moore to protect herself.
	This is a public place. Dan William won't kill her on the spot. Does she still have time to escape?
	Jamie Moore will never admit that she doesn’t have any courage, but the eyesight of Dan William is too terrible.
	They look at each other for a long time. Dan William turns around and then he snorts. Then he picks up Ian Moore from her arms and then walks over her to the outside of the restaurant.
	So will she be OK? Now Jamie Moore has got her sense. She finds that she has saved her life.
	Wait, Bunny！
	Jamie Moore stands up suddenly, and then she runs out to catch them.
	But Dan William drives away when he finds her. What leaves is just a series of smelly exhaust gas. Jamie Moore is so angry that she wants to beat him with her bag.
	"If you have the ability, you should stop now!" Jamie Moore who only has two legs, can't catch up at all. She can only be angry in situ.
	Jamie Moore always remembers revenge, and she always remembers the saying that women could revenge ten days later.
	Sitting on the car, Ian Moore turns to look at Jamie Moore, and he even could feel the murderous air from mummy. He shivers.
	"Uncle, why don't you take the opportunity to take my mommy home?" Ian Moore is puzzled. According to the style of the behavior of his father, since he catches his mother, how could he let her go so simply? It's really suspicious.
	"Didn't I tell you call me daddy just now?" Dan William says in a deep voice.
	Ian Moore smiles, “Now is different. Don’t you know that people are very fickle?
	“...”
	"I will tell you if you call me daddy.” Dan William raises his eyebrow. Little guy, it's too tender for you to fight with me.
	Ian Moore is shocked, and he presses his lips. It is true that he can’t beat his father.
	"Daddy!" Ian Moore says softly.
	Hearing Ian Moore’s voice, Dan William is shocked. But he still pretends that he is calm, “ Yeah!”
	Ian Moore frowns, and then he rolls at Dan William. Daddy, it’s true that you are so happy, so can you stop holding it? It's very hard.
	"We will take no action at this time, and you mommy will come to us by herself." Dan William holds the steering wheel tightly, and his eyes are very cold. He is calculating something.
	Ian Moore approaches to him, and listens to the detailed plan of him.
	A careful plan is launched in the car.
	In the next day, Jamie Moore watches the TV in the sofa leisurely. She watches the loving TV show as she eats the junk food on the table.
	When Jamie Moore is free, she loves to watch this loving TV show. And she will comment the show when she watches it.
	"What kind of hairstyle is this? Is the designer from Mars? " Jamie Moore is eating chips. She sees one of the girls appears on the screen, and she is almost choked by herself.
	"Eh, doesn’t she think it's too heavy to wear so many things..." Jamie Moore shakes her head after watching for a while.
	Since the show is so terrible, why does she still watch it? She is too bored.
	"Jamie Moore, please answer the phone. Jamie Moore, please answer the phone. Jamie Moore, where did you go? Why didn’t you answer the phone? The phone rings suddenly. Jamie Moore, who is holding the bag of chips, is shocked. She almost throws the chips away. She stands up and draws a tissue to wipe her hand, and then she answers the phone.

Chapter 102 Dating
	"Hello?"
	"Mommy, there is something bad happened!” The crying voice come from Ian Moore, "Daddy is going to take the baby to have a blind date with a woman! It's in the box on the seventh floor of Star Hotel... "Jamie Moore is so surprised that she even forgets how to reply. And then Ian Moore hangs up.
	"Hello?" Seeing that the phone is hanging up, Jamie Moore calls Ian Moore again. But the phone has turned off.
	Dan William is such a beast. How could he take her son to have a blind date with a woman!
	How old is Ian Moore? Anyway, he is Ian Moore’s father. Does he want to send his son away?
	Jamie Moore stares at the screen of the phone. Even if Ian Moore can stand it, she can’t stand it. If he dares to take his son to have a blind date with a woman, she will bite him to death!
	Then Jamie Moore returns to the room to change the clothes. Even though she will be loser, she can’t lose in momentum. Although she can’t beat Dan William, she must win him in momentum. She is Ian Moore’s mother.
	At the same time, Ian Moore puts the phone into the pocket, and then he smiles at Dan William.
	"OK! But will Mommy really come?" Ian Moore stares at Dan William, who is sitting on the sofa, and he doubts about this, "If Mommy doesn't care about you; it doesn't matter if you have a blind date with another woman."
	Dan William smiles confidently, “You should believe me. If you says according to my words, you mommy will believe us. Because she will think that it’s you who will have a date.”
	Which sentence? Ian Moore thinks in his mind.
	Is the sentence that daddy will take the baby to have a blind date will a woman?
	Ian Moore praises his father in his heart silently. Daddy is really a schemer. “Mommy, you should not struggle. Go with Daddy quickly. In this way, you will not be fooled for a long time...”
	"But you should have a woman to date with you!” Ian Moore asks again.
	"Don't worry, she will come here soon." Dan William hooks up with Ian Moore. Ian Moore comes to Dan William, and then Dan William tells his plan to Dan William.
	Jamie Moore comes to Star Hotel quickly, but she is stopped by the front desk. "Excuse me, Miss, are you dining alone or have an appointment with another people?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, “I have an appointment with other people.”
	"Which room is it, please?"
	"It’s the box of the seventh floor." Ian Moore doesn’t tell Jamie Moore which box they are. He only says it’s in the seventh floor. She doesn’t know if the waiter will let her in.
	"Oh, you are Dan William's guest, please go upstairs." The hotel waiter walks in the front of Jamie Moore to guide her.
	She doesn’t think too much. Jamie Moore walks into the elevator and presses the button of the seventh floor.
	At the same time, July Summer arrives at the box of the seventh floor ten minutes earlier. She dresses herself well. The clothes she wears is the newly style of the Cr. The shoes she wears is 10 centimeter high-heeled shoes. Her whole body is emanating with the smell of Chanel perfume. She smiles brightly, and she walks into the box like a proud peacock.
	"Honey~" as soon as July Summer enters the door, she sees Dan William who is sitting on the sofa. Thus she calls him intimately. Then she walks to Dan William, and she wants to sits beside Dan William. But she sees Ian Moore who sits beside Dan William.
	"Honey, this is..." July Summer narrows her eyes. She looks at the handsome face of Ian Moore, and the she looks at Dan William.
	They really look like each other.
	July Summer even can’t keep the smile on her face. He has been walk in the Cr for a long time, but she never hears that Dan William has a son!
	Ian Moore is not happy when he hears what July Summer calls Dan William. Then he reminds the gossip between Dan William and July Summer, thus he feels very uncomfortable.
	Thus Ian Moore turns to look at Dan William and asks, “Daddy, is this the woman you loved?”
	"Of course not." the eyes of Dan William become serious suddenly, and then he looks at July Summer in a warning eyes.
	"Then why does she call you daddy? Only if two people are lovers, they could call each other honey. Does Daddy have a close relationship with this old aunt?” Ian Moore asks in a childish way.
	Hearing Ian Moore’s words, July Summer does melt down.
	How could he call her old aunt? Is she looking so old?
	What a girl care about most is appearance and age.
	The word--old aunt--stabs into July Summer’s heart like a knife.
	What’s more, for July Summer, Dan William is special. But Ian Moore calls her old aunt, which make her feel diffident in front of Dan William.
	"Well, Bunny is right. Can you hear it, July? " Dan William smiles and he rubs Ian Moore’s hear. Then he says to July Summer, “I don't want Bunny misunderstand me, so in the future, please call me general manager William."
	The smiles on July Summer’s face disappears, and then she nods, “No problem.”
	Ian Moore sneers. He kills a rival for his mother. It's awesome.
	Dan William knows Ian Moore’s mind, but he doesn’t tear him down, and she even plays with him.
	"Dan William!" The door of the box is opened suddenly with an angry voice, and then Jamie Moore walks into the box suddenly.
	The three people, who are eating, are all shocked. And then they see Jamie Moore walk to the table with an angry expression.
	Dan William puts the knife and fork down gracefully, and he wipes the corners of his mouth with a napkin, and then he looks at Jamie Moore who is very angry. Then he asks, "What are you doing?"
	Ah.
	Ian Moore almost sprays the juice he just drinks. Then he looks at Dan William. “Daddy, it’s you who tricks mommy to here. Now mommy comes here, how could you ask mommy--what is she doing here?”
	Ian Moore has another understanding of his daddy again.
	Jamie Moore looks around in the box. She presses her lips when she sees July Summer. Then she slaps heavily on the table in front of Dan William, “What am I doing here?”
	She points at July Summer, “If I don’t come here, will you let my son to have a blind date with such an old woman? You are a beast. Does my son provoke you? Thus you want to send him away. Even though you want to send him away, can’t you find a young and lovely girl? How could you find such an old woman?”
	Hearing Jamie Moore’s words, July Summer knows that she is Ian Moore’s mother, but...
	Why?
	Why do they all call her old woman? Is she looking so old? What’s more, who want to have a date with her son?
	July Summer feels very angry, thus she cuts the steak in front of her heavily. They all ask her old woman. So she even doubts that her skin is not as good as before...
	"Honey, come with me. Maybe one day this guy will sell you to other people." Jamie Moore holds Ian Moore’s hands and then walks out.
	She even thinks that Dan William will love Ian Moore, and she even wants to receive him.

Chapter 103 Overlord Clause
	"Wait." Dan William grabs Jamie Moore’s hands and then he pulls Jamie Moore to his side.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore holds Ian Moore and then she looks at him warily. "Don’t you want to rob him, do you? I tell you, it's a society ruled by law Ouch!"
	Dan William kicks Jamie Moore’s head, and says, "You are so stupid."
	Jamie Moore is very angry. Ian Moore even could hear the voice of grinding teeth.
	“OK, so why do you take my son to have a blind date with a woman?” Jamie Moore asks.
	"This is also my son." Dan William corrects it with a smile.
	"That's not the point!"
	"Who told you that I will take my son to have a blind date with a woman?” Dan William puts the responsibility to Jamie Moore, whose IQ is not up to standard.
	Jamie Moore holds Ian Moore, and Ian Moore doesn’t speak anything. He looks at Jamie Moore and Dan William excitedly, who is quarrel with each other. Even though he is very young, he although know that love needs quarrel.
	"It’s my son who tells me this!” Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore, “Am I right, baby? Don't be afraid. Speak up bravely. Mommy will be your strong back."
	Ian Moore blinks. Why the question comes to his side?
	"Mommy, you are wrong." Ian Moore is confused for a while, but he decides to follow what Dan William teaches him.
	"How is it possible? Baby, is someone threatening you? Don't be afraid. Tell mommy, and Mommy will avenge you." Jamie Moore stares at Dan William as she says.
	"No, Mommy, what I said is Daddy will have a blind date, and it’s not me.” Ian Moore looks at Dan William and then he puts the question back to Dan William. He looks very innocent and lovely, which makes Ian Moore reluctant to ask again.
	But when Jamie Moore hears it’s Dan William who will have a blind date, her mood become even worse, but she can’t tell the true reason.
	Dan William sees the changing expression of Jamie Moore, and then he smiles.
	Luckily, he is still in her heart.
	"Ho... Mr. William, would you like to introduce her to me?" When July Summer realizes that she is ignored, thus she says which draws the attention of all the people.
	Jamie Moore looks at July Summer. It should be said that July Summer is the most qualified model that Jamie Moore has ever met. She has a unique face and body, as well as a wonderful opportunity.
	But when Jamie Moore finds there is relationship between July Summer and Dan William, she feels very sad.
	"I'm Jamie Moore, and I'm Ian Moore's Mommy. Hello." Jamie Moore introduces herself to July Summer quickly with a proper smile on her face.
	Is her surname Moore?
	July Summer raises her eyebrow, and then she looks at Dan William, “Hello, my name is July Summer.”
	"I know." Jamie Moore says with smile.
	"Is Mr. William his father? So why he is not called William?” July Summer asks curiously.
	"I give birth to this child. He has nothing relationship with Dan William." Jamie Moore says. She feels a pain in her thigh after finishing her words. It’s true that she is calculated by Dan William again.
	July Summer looks at Dan William again, but there doesn’t have any expression on Dan William's face, and he even doesn’t explain this to her.
	"Since they don’t have any relationship, why does your child call general manager William Daddy?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she stares at Ian Moore. How could this guy help others? How could he become a helper of Dan William in such a few days? Does he have any backbone?
	Ian Moore shrinks his neck. Mommy, even you don’t have any backbone. How can you expect your baby to have backbone? But he dares not to say it out.
	“Miss Summer, have you been an entertainment reporter? You have so many questions.” Jamie Moore asks lightly. Seeing that July Summer’s face become stiff, she smiles.
	"Miss Moore, you are really good at joking. It’s true that I have done a lot of work before. Finally, general manager William recommends me to work in the Cr." July Summer smiles and her words are full of ambiguity.
	Jamie Moore rolls the eyes, and she ignores the expression of July Summer.
	"Miss Summer, you really have the courage. You even choose the model as your career. It’s really a competitive but thankless industry. It’s Dan William who helps you to reach the summit of your career.”
	July Summer changes her face, but she doesn’t speak anything. She knows that what she said will make she unhappy, thus she finds an excuse to leave. Besides, Dan William is the strong back of Jamie Moore.
	It’s Dan William who let July Summer reach the summit of her career. It’s not good to offend him.
	Seeing that July Summer walks away, the smile on Jamie Moore disappears. She doesn’t look at Dan William, and then she walks out with Ian Moore.
	Dan William blinks his eyes, and then he stands up to follow them.
	It seems that she is jealous.
	When Dan William walks out, he sees that Jamie Moore walks to the parking lot. And she sits into his car with Ian Moore
	He smiles, and then he walks to the car. He opens the door and sits in the car. Then he looks at Jamie Moore who is silent.
	It’s rare for her to be so quiet. It seems that she is really angry this time.
	Even though she is angry, the plan should be continued.
	"Now I will give you two choices. The first one is that you hand the son to me and you go back to the apartment alone. The second one is that you could go back to the manor with us. I will give you five minutes to think.” Dan William helps Jamie Moore to fasten the beat belt. He puts his hands on the steering wheel. He is in a lazy way, but his words are full of firmness.
	"Which choice? It’s the overlord clause!" No matter how she chooses, it's her fault, but if she doesn't choose to go back with Dan William, he will take the baby away.
	"Four minutes." It seems that Dan William doesn’t hear her. His long fingers beat rhythmically on the steering wheel. "You can make no choose, but maybe one day I will take my son to have a blind date, and then I will find a stepmother for him."
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and then she says, “Dan William, do you have any qualify to find stepmother for my son? I'm his mommy. You just came out later. Am I dying?"
	"Do I come out later?" Dan William suddenly smiles, but the smile is full of danger. He holds Jamie Moore’s chin suddenly, and his eyes are full of cold, "Why do I appear now? You know the reason well than anyone?"
	Jamie Moore looks back at him, and her eyes are full of stubborn. Is she angry for finding a stepmother for Ian Moore or for his suddenly appearance?
	Even though she had hided the existence of Ian Moore, the source of all the mistakes is not because of her!
	"Woo, woo..." Seeing that the thing is not good, Ian Moore, who is sitting on the back seat, cries suddenly.
	Jamie Moore immediately unbuckles the seat belt and looks back at Ian Moore. Seeing that Ian Moore is crying, she is very sad, and she asks, "What's wrong with baby? Why are you crying?"
	
Chapter 104 You Should Call Me Daddy
	"Woo, both daddy and mummy doesn’t like baby." Ian Moore covers his face with his fat hands, which hurts other people’s heart.
	When Dan William sees Ian Moore is crying, he is a little flustered, but he doesn’t know how to coax him. Thus he says, "How can it be? Daddy likes baby best. Don't cry baby."
	He is willing to put all the good things in front of him. How could he not like him?
	"Yeah, yeah, mommy also likes baby best." Jamie Moore takes the handkerchief out of the pocket to wipe tears for Ian Moore as she says, but Ian Moore dodges away.
	"But other people's parents all lives with their children. Why don't you live with mummy and me? And you even want to take me away, thus I can’t stay with mommy." Ian Moore puts his hand down, and his eyes are full of eyes, as if he is accusing them.
	Dan William and Jamie Moore all pauses for a while, and then they look at each other.
	Dan William holds Jamie Moore in his arms, and then he smiles bitterly. He promises to Ian Moore, “No. Daddy will live with Mommy, and we will never stay away with you.”
	Jamie Moore struggles for a while, but she sees Dan William’s warning eyes, thus she stops.
	"Mommy, is that true?" Ian Moore sniffs. He blinks his eyes, and it seems that he is looking forward to it.
	Jamie Moore wants to say something, but she feels pain in her waist. She knows that it’s Dan William who did this. Thus she looks at Ian Moore with a smile, “Of course, this is true. Mommy will never cheat you.”
	Now she will follow Dan William’s action, and she will run away with Ian Moore secretly.
	It seems that Ian Moore knows Jamie Moore’s mind. He stares at Jamie Moore and says, “Will mommy live with daddy and me all the time?”
	Jamie Moore wants to say-never think about this, but she is stopped by Dan William, “As long as baby love this, I will live with your daddy and baby all the time."
	Ian Moore smiles suddenly, and his eyes are full of sneers.
	Jamie Moore is depressed. This feeling is just like eating a bug. And she feels very uncomfortable. She feels all her life is broken when she realizes that she will live with Dan William for a long time. What if Dan William wants to insult her one day?
	But now it's too late to regret.
	Dan William steps on the brake, and then he unfastens the seat belt, and then he gets out of the car with Ian Moore in is hand.
	Although Ian Moore thinks it's harmful to the image of a man, he's willing to do so since daddy wants to hug him.
	Jamie Moore lingers in the car for a while, and finally she walks out. She signs when she sees the villa in front of him. She comes back after so many years...
	"Young master, little young master...Miss Jamie Moore?” Seeing Dan William comes back, Cindy Swift walks toward them. But she is surprised when she sees Jamie Moore who stands besides Dan William and Ian Moore.
	Jamie Moore smiles at Cindy Swift, and the smile is simple and soft.
	"Well, have you prepared the room well?" Dan William asks, and then he walks into the villa with Ian Moore in his arms.
	"Yes, everything is arranged according to the requirements of the young master. The room is just opposite the young master's room." Cindy Swift replies respectfully.
	Dan William turns to look at Jamie Moore, and then he smiles, “Come with me."
	"Oh." Jamie Moore presses her lips and then she follows Dan William unwillingly.
	When Dan William comes to the second floor, he puts Dan William down. He rubs the hair of Ian Moore, and says, “Open the door and looks at the room.”
	"OK." Ian Moore answers happily and tiptoes to open the door.
	This room is prepared for Ian Moore when Dan William brings him back here for the first time. The style now is different from before, which is black and white. The walls are painted in blue, and the ceiling and walls are decorated in sky. In the middle of the room, there is a dark blue children's bed. In front of the bed, there is a notebook computer on the small desk. Two bookcases are placed on both sides of the desk. He can hold the book on the bookshelf as soon as he reaches out. It must be carefully arranged.
	Except this, there is a series of wind bells hangs in front of the French windows.
	One can see the red maple trail outside the balcony from here. There is also a swing chair on the balcony, which is exactly the same as the one made by grandmother.
	He loves it.
	Jamie Moore also moves by this. Her eyes quivers slightly, and then she turns her head away. No one knows her thinking.
	"Do you like it?" Dan William says in a tense way. He designs all the things here alone. And he arranges all of this in the shortest time. He just wants to give Ian Moore a more comfortable living environment.
	"I love it!" Ian Moore jumps on the children's bed happily, and then he rolls around with the quilt. The quilt has a light smell of milk.
	Jamie Moore looks at Dan William, and then suddenly she suddenly reminds of something, “Wait a minute, this is Ian Moore's room, where do I sleep?"
	Ian Moore stands up suddenly after hearing the words. And then he says before Dan William, “ Of course. You should sleep with uncle, am I right? Uncle.”
	Uncle? Jamie Moore laughs, but when she sees Dan William's gloomy face, she quickly stops laughing.
	“Uncle? Am I your daddy? Uh huh?” Dan William looks at Ian Moore. It seems that he doesn’t adapt to the change of address.
	Ian Moore blinks innocently, "But Mommy never admits you, so I'd better call you uncle."
	Just now, he calls him daddy all the time.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore with threatening eyes, but he still has a smile on his face. "Jamie Moore, don’t you think my son should call me daddy?" He asks slowly, his voice is always cool and charming. As he spoke, he slowly approaches to Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore feels very frightened.
	"It should be like this. He should call you daddy." Jamie Moore is soon forced to the door. Seeing that Dan William walks close to her, Jamie Moore says in a firm way.
	"Anyway, this is your territory. You could say everything. Even you ask me to call you Daddy, I also should do this...” Originally, Jamie Moore thinks this in her heart silently, but she says it accidentally.
	Dan William's eyes are stained with displeasure. "Who ask you to be my daughter? You're going to be taught again, aren't you?"
	Jamie Moore shakes her head desperately. "I never say anything!"
	Dan William snorts, and then he suddenly reminds of something. He holds Jamie Moore’s hand, and says, “OK, let’s go to our room.”
	"Our room" Dan William says in a firm way. Jamie Moore has a bad premonition in her heart.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is put out by Dan William, Ian Moore sneers on the bed.
	"Young master." Night.1 suddenly appears in the room. He wears sunglasses, and he always looks very cold.
	"What’s the matter?" Ian Moore withdraws his smile, and then he stands up and looks at Night.1.
	
Chapter 105 Make a Deal
	Ian Moore has to look up at Night.1. The height hurts Ian Moore.
	It seems that Night.1 has known Ian Moore’s idea, thus he squats down and looks at Ian Moore, “Little younger master, that woman disappears."
	Does Mia Moore disappear? Ian Moore narrows his eyes. She could run away like this. There must be someone behind this woman.
	"You should continue to find her." Ian Moore’s voice is full of cold. If someone hurt his mommy, he will never let him go.
	"Yes." Night.1 replies, and then his figure disappeared in the room.
	On the other side, Dan William takes Jamie Moore into his room. Jamie Moore has entered this room several times, but she hasn't seen it well.
	His bedroom is decorated with black and white. The room is full of cold and indifferent, this is just like the style of Dan William.
	But that's not the point!
	"Will you listen to the words of baby? Don't be so conceited..." Jamie Moore swallows saliva. It's not easy for them to live under the same roof. If they live in the same room, she will lose her life.
	"What do you think of this?" Dan William puts his hands in his pockets. The two buttons on his shirt are unbuttoned at will, revealing his healthy wheat skin. It’s wild and sexy, making people unable to move their eyes.
	"Since we don't want to make baby sad, let's make a deal." Jamie Moore says after thinking for a while.
	Dan William raises his eyebrows and says, “Um?”
	"First, you can't do anything to me and you shouldn’t have any impure thoughts on me during this period." Jamie Moore says calmly.
	Dan William walks to her with a smile, and his eyes are full of sunshine, “What’s the meaning of the impure thoughts?”
	"That is..." Jamie Moore presses her lips. She doesn’t know how to explain this. She doesn't believe Dan William doesn't know this.
	"If we need to act as a good intimate couple, but we don’t have any intimate behavior, will baby believe us?" Dan William stares at her little red face, and he smiles. He is just like the most patient hunter, and he lures his prey into the traps he had dug.
	Dan William is right. He knows his son is very smart. It’s not easy to cheat him.
	"We can just do this intimate behavior in front of the baby!" Second, you can't have any gossip or other intimate behavior with other women.”
	"Jamie Moore, are you jealous of this?" His voice is full of magnetic, which is just like the wine that has been precipitated for decades.
	Jamie Moore’s face become red, and then she stares at Dan William, “I'm just worried that baby will misunderstand you."
	Dan William’s eyes are full of smile.
	"Third, you should not tell anyone that we live together."
	"OK." Dan William says with a smile. He will never tell anyone that they live together.
	Jamie Moore is stunned for a while. She thinks that it would be not easy to persuade Dan William. But he agrees her quest in such an easy way.
	Ian Moore returns to his own room after having dinner. Dan William goes to the study. Thus Jamie Moore leaves in the living room alone.
	Jamie Moore watches the TV show in the living room, but her heart has gone.
	If there doesn’t have any servants around, she would have been lying down for a long time, which is the standard habit of lazy people.
	But...
	She looks around. Although all the servants lower their head, she still dares not act rashly.
	What did Dan William do? She likes to see Dan William keeps angry.
	Later, Mrs. Swift comes out of the kitchen with a glass of milk on the plate.
	The milk is for Dan William.
	Jamie Moore sends the milk to Dan William for Cindy Swift. Cindy Swift tells her that this glass of milk is mixed with some sleeping pills. Now the sleep quality of Dan William is poor. He can only sleep for three to five hours a day, and most of the time he falls asleep with sleeping pills.
	She remembers that the sleep quality of Dan William is very well before she goes abroad. At that time, she always sneaks into his room and compete with him who would fall asleep first, and he would win every time.
	Now Jamie Moore realizes that it's not her that had a bad time in those years, Dan William also live in a hard way.
	When she gets her sense, she has walked into the room. Dan William sits in front of the desk, and he is looking at the computer. Dan William is surprised when he finds Jamie Moore walks into the room.
	Jamie Moore gets her sense, and then she walks to Dan William. She puts the milk in the front of Dan William and says, “Cindy Swift ask me to take this to you, she told me that this is good for your sleep.”
	"Will you add poison in the milk?" Dan William picks the glass of milk up. And then he makes a joke to Jamie Moore.
	"Yes, I put poison in it. You'd better be poisoned at once." Jamie Moore moves a stool and sits next to Dan William. Now she is very calm.
	"If I died, you will be widow.” Dan William drinks the milk up, and he does all of this in a smooth way.
	Jamie Moore blinks her eyes and then she smiles. "I didn't marry you. If you die, I'll marry a handsome and rich man with my son."
	Dan William's face suddenly sink, "Do you want to get rid of me in such a hurry way?"
	He adds, "Is handsome and rich man Ryan Jack?"
	Dan William sneers, and then he looks at her like an idiot. "Only when Ryan Jack is blind, he will love you."
	He looks at Jamie Moore, and then he despises her.
	Jamie Moore is so angry that she even wants to beat him. But she can’t win Dan William, “You're blind. I have all the good things, OK?"
	Even she doesn't have a D cup, she also have a C cup. The figure is very standard. Many people told her that she has a good figure.
	Dan William glances at her, and her eyesight become dark.
	"I should put poison in the milk. Even that I could not kill you, you will lose your voice!” Jamie Moore stands up. Then she walks out of the door as she whispers.
	Dan William shakes his head and then he smiles. He turns off the computer, and sorts out the documents on the table, and then he walks out.
	The study and bedroom are all on the second floor, so it’s very close.
	Dan William goes to look at Ian Moore first, and he finds Ian Moore has fall asleep. He closes the door, and walks to his own room.
	He frowns when he finds the door is locked. It must be Jamie Moore who did this.
	Then he turns around and walks to the downstairs.
	Jamie Moore can't see the thing happened outside. She thinks Dan William will leave away when he finds the door is locked. She smiles happily. If she could get rid of him in such an easy way, she will not worry about before.
	She takes out some clothes that she had brought from her apartment today, and she is going to sleep with her pajamas.
	Clicking.
	The door is opened.
	Jamie Moore looks back, and then her heart sink to the bottom.
	Dan William walks into the door with smile on his face
	"You, how did you get in?!" Jamie Moore jumps up abruptly from the sofa and asks.
	Dan William shakes the key between his fingers. And he looks at Jamie Moore as if she is a fool. "This is my home. Can’t I enter the room?"
	Jamie Moore turns her head away. So what's the use of locking the door?

	She takes a deep breath and she tries to calm herself down. Since she can’t beat him, thus she only has to show her endurance. "OK, you sleep on the sofa and I sleep on the bed tonight. Do you have any opinion?"
	"Yes." Dan William answers, and then he puts the key on the table.
	“What?”
	"I want to sleep on the bed, too." he says calmly, and he makes a request directly.
	Jamie Moore is very angry and she stares at Dan William and says, “There is only one bed, will you let me sleep on the sofa? As a man, what’s your demeanor?"
	Dan William walks toward her with a smile, “Do I ask you to sleep on the sofa?”
	Jamie Moore returns back, and she looks at him warily. Then she reminds of something. "You want to..."
	"Don't worry. I don't have any interest in your wizened figure." Dan William smiles, and then he takes his robe and walks into the bathroom to take a bath.
	“That because you are short and small, and you are so shallow...” Jamie Moore whispers.
	Dan William always has a good ear, thus he hears this sentence. Then he suddenly looks back at her with a gloomy face. "What did you say?"
	Short and small?
	"No, no, I'm talking about my fingers. They are short and small. And I am not saying you. It would be nice if they could grow longer and thinner..." Jamie Moore wants to prove that she is right, thus she even outstretches her hand to prove it.
	Her hands are white and beautiful. It doesn’t match with her words.
	Dan William snorts. He decides to let her go first, and then he walks into the bathroom.
	Jamie Moore sighs with relief and then she looks at the pajamas. It’s a dress style, which just reached the knee, and there is a belt around the waist. It’s very conservative.
	She lies on the bed, and covers her body well with the thin quilt over. One could only see her head.
	The sound of the water in the bathroom stops. Jamie Moore immediately wakes up and she stares at the direction of the bathroom. She dares not to be relaxed.
	After a while, Dan William walks out of the bathroom. He wears a gray robe, and his hair is wet. Because he just takes a bath, thus the whole body of him is full of light fragrance of man's body wash.
	Jamie Moore covers her face with the quilt. She feels hot. But she doesn’t want to admit that she blushes for Dan William in such a way.
	Dan William wipes his hair with a towel, and then he sees Jamie Moore who covers herself with the quilt tightly, thus he smiles.
	"Do you want to suffocate yourself?" he walks to the bed and sits on the other side of the bed.
	"Dan William, if you dare to do something bad to me tonight, I will bite you." Jamie Moore warns him viciously. Now she is just like a hairy cat.
	Dan William sneers and says, “I think I’m more danger than you. You shouldn’t do anything bad to me in the middle of the night. "
	"I have no idea on you. Do you think I'm a lecher?" Jamie Moore has never seen such a cheeky man. How could he treat her like this?
	She is not that kind of person.
	"It’s good that you have no idea on me. Now close your eyes and go to sleep." Dan William turns off the bedroom headlight with the remote control. Then he turns down the light of bedside lamp, and lies on the other side of the bed.
	Jamie Moore humphs silently, and only the sound of breathing leaves in the room.
	She even could smell the light fragrance of man's body wash on Dan William’s body. She almost wrapped by the strong smell of men's hormones, which make her face become more and more red.
	She is so confused that she couldn't fall asleep at all.
	"Hello, Dan William, are you asleep?" Jamie Moore looks at Dan William. The face of Dan William becomes more angular in the dim light.
	"Yeah." Dan William answers lightly.
	"I want to drink water." Jamie Moore presses her lips.
	"The water is over there. You could get by yourself." Dan William points at the direction, and then he withdraws his hand, and he doesn’t want to help her at all.
	Jamie Moore turns her eyes and then she says in a sweet voice, “I cover myself well, and you should pour water for me."
	The room is very quiet. Dan William doesn’t take any action. Jamie Moore thinks Dan William will not help her, but he suddenly stands up to pour water.
	Jamie Moore feels very happy, and then she sees Dan William walks to her, and hands the water to her, “Drink it.”
	Jamie Moore wants to hold the water, but she wraps herself tightly, and she can’t reach his hand out.
	"If you don’t drink water, I'll put it back." Dan William raises her eyes to look at her.
	She wants to drink water, but she can’t reach out to hold it.
	"Wait, my hands are wrapped..." Jamie Moore says in a weak voice. Her face becomes red. If she doesn’t want to drink water, she would not be so embarrassed.
	Jamie Moore feels shameful.
	"Oh? Can't you deal with it? How would you drink?" Dan William is not in a hurry, and he shakes the glass toward Jamie Moore.
	"Please feed me." Jamie Moore blinks her eyes. She says in a calm way, and she stares at the glass of water in Dan William’s hand.
	Dan William sneers, and then he drinks water, “Are you sure?”
	Jamie Moore is very angry. Do they kiss with each other? Bad man!
	"Do you want to drink water? Open your mouth." Dan William walks to Jamie Moore. He puts his hand on her waist. And then he feeds the water to her.
	"Am I stupid? You...?" Water runs directly down the throat into the abdomen. In order not to be choked to death, Jamie Moore could only swallow the water.
	"Cough, cough, cough..." After drinking a glass of water, Jamie Moore stares at Dan William, “Are you disgusted? You have drunk the water, and you even hand it to me!"
	"Don't you want to drink water?" Dan William puts the water cup on the table and then he looks at her.
	"But I don't want to drink water that you have drunk!" Jamie Moore presses her lips, and she scolds Dan William in her heart. She shouldn't let Dan William pour water for herself. It’s a torture.
	"Then you can spit it out." Dan William raises his eyebrows proudly. Then he lifts the thin quilt and lies down.
	Jamie Moore looks slightly sideways, and then she pulls the thin quilt away.
	Then Jamie Moore raises her legs slightly and then kicks Dan William suddenly. Dan William doesn’t notice this, thus he is kicked down by Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore looks up, and she sees Dan William sits on the ground, and then she laughs loudly.
	“Jamie Moore!” Dan William says in an angry voice. Then he leans against the bed, and sits on the soft and clean floor.
	Hearing Dan William’s voice, the smiles on Jamie Moore’s face disappears. Then she leans against the bed and looks at Dan William seriously. Then she puts the finger on her lips and says, "Don't make any noise. If you stay up late, you will grow old. Go to sleep now."
	After saying this, Jamie Moore covers herself with the quilt. And then she closes her eyes and falls asleep.
	Dan William feels very angry.
	He can't sleep, Jamie Moore could sleep well? This is impossible.
	Thus Dan William makes a very childish move. He jumps to bed and pulls the quilt on Jamie Moore’s body, and then he throws it away.
	“Dan William! What are you doing?" Jamie Moore feels very cold. And then she finds the quilt on her body disappears. No one would rob her quilt except Dan William!
	Dan William doesn’t say anything, and he looks at her defiantly.
	Jamie Moore stands up quietly, and then she reaches out her foot to hook Dan William’s quilt. Then she throws the quilt to the window.
	
Chapter 107 The Call from Brother
	"Jamie Moore!" Jamie Moore throws his pillow to the ground and she even steps it. Besides, she even rubs the ashes on the wall and then slaps the ashes on the place where Dan William sleeps!
	Dan William reminds what Jamie Moore did in the childhood after seeing this. If someone moves the things of her, she will never let him go easily.
	This is her personality, and it doesn’t change at all!
	Dan William looks at the two dirty fingerprints on the white bed angrily. He grabs the collar of Jamie Moore, and puts her on the bed, and then he turned her over and pressed her against his leg.
	Then Dan William did an unexpected move!
	Pops pops pops!
	With a few pops sounds, Jamie Moore is stunned. She feels very pain on her buns, and she even loss her sense. The pain from her buns is amplified rapidly, which make her think slowly.
	Dan William, what did he do?
	How could he beat her buns?
	How could he beat her buns?
	It’s too late when Jamie Moore gets her sense. She is beaten by Dan William. The way he used is the same as before, and even the posture is the same.
	But is that the point?
	"Dan William! Bitch! I'm will fight with you!" Jamie Moore struggles desperately to stand up.
	Her dignity! Her face! Her ass!
	"Do you think I'm your son? How could you beat my buns! I will kill you!" Jamie Moore kicks Dan William.
	Her eyes become red, and she is very mad. Her body is small and soft, thus Dan William could do everything he wants.
	"Why are you the same as a child?" Dan William frowns, and he says with a little helplessness.
	What he hopes most is that Jamie Moore is the same as before and now the scene seems to be return back to the childhood.
	But Jamie Moore calms down when she hears the words. What she reminds is some bad memories.
	Her heart beats heavily. She closes her eyes for a while. When she opens the eyes again, her eyes have no emotion.
	She stands up with her hand. Then she returns to the bed after picking up the quilt. She keeps silent.
	Dan William is surprised. He frowns and looks at Jamie Moore. He doesn’t know the reason for her anger.
	After hesitating for a while, he decides not to ask her, and then he turns to lie on the other side of the bed.
	They all can’t fall asleep.
	Jamie Moore falls asleep in the 7 o’clock, and she wakes up in 10 o’clock. Because she didn't sleep for a night, she has black eyes. It seems that she is very listless.
	She turns around, and then she finds Dan William has left. It’s good, because she doesn’t want to see him now.
	After washing, Jamie Moore goes to the room of Ian Moore. But when she opens the door, she doesn’t find Ian Moore.
	So she goes downstairs. Seeing Jamie Moore goes downstairs, Cindy Swift asks, “Miss Jamie, do you have breakfast now?"
	"OK." Jamie Moore nods. She looks around, but she still doesn’t find Ian Moore.
	"Jamie Moore, the younger master has taken him to the new school to register this morning." Cindy Swift says to Jamie Moore with a smile, and then she asks other servant to bring breakfast to Jamie Moore.
	Then Jamie Moore reminds that today is a working day. Ian Moore needs to go to school, so Dan William should be work in the company.
	She is the only one at home, so the servant only cooks one breakfast for her. The dishes look very delicious, but Jamie Moore can’t enjoy it.
	All of a sudden, she feels like she has been a mistress of Dan William.
	If her brother knows this, he will come to Country C directly.
	The thing happened according to her thinking.
	The mobile phone at hand suddenly rings. This is the special ring for Chris Lockwood. Unlike the funny ring for Ian Moore, this is a beautiful violin song.
	Jamie Moore puts down her knife and fork. She picks the phone up and then she walks out to answer the phone.
	"Brother?" Jamie Moore walks towards the swimming pool slowly. The weather is very good today. When she walks out, she even feels a little hot.
	"Jamie ~" the soft voice come from the other side of the phone, and he says in a foreign accent.
	"How are you and dad? I miss you very much." Jamie Moore looks at the scenery in the distance, and she is a little disappointed.
	She has only met her father twice. When Ian Moore is born, she meets her father for the first time. When she returns back to China, she meets her father for the second time.
	She knows that her father is very busy, but she doesn't know what he is doing. If it wasn't for her mother's revenge and the man she loved here, she would not come back here.
	Chris Lockwood cannot enter the territory of Country C, otherwise he will be discovered by the eyeliner of Jack Moore. At that time, Jamie Moore would be in danger.
	Chris Lockwood keeps silence for a while. Chris Lockwood says in a heavy voice, "Well, we are very good. I heard that you are injured there."
	"Who told you that? Brother, you can't come to Country C, am I right?" Jamie Moore wonders.
	"It’s true that I can’t come to Country C, but I know all the things happened in Country C.” Chris Lockwood says in a mysterious way, "I have eyeliner over there."
	"Who is it? Why don't I know?"
	"Well, now I can't tell you all the things. It's more exciting to keep the sense of mystery." Chris Lockwood says the words in a heavy way. His voice is just like the sound of cello, and it’s very infectious.
	"If you don't tell me, I will find the person by myself." Jamie Moore puts out her tongue.
	She also knows Chris Lockwood's concerns. Although the Moore Family doesn’t find trouble with her since something bad happened to Mia Moore. But this doesn’t mean that they will give up. Jack Moore is foxy and he is very ambitious.
	His ability of endure is very strong. He takes over the remaining forces of the Gilbert family secretly. If the organization of ten members is taken over by him for his own use, the consequences will be unimaginable.
	At that time, Jack Moore will make trouble with Jamie Moore first.
	In Jack Moore’s eyes, Jamie Moore is still his daughter. Although he doesn’t like Jamie Moore, if Jamie Moore disappears suddenly, Celina Swift and Mia Moore will benefit most.
	But what Jack Moore doesn’t know is that she is not his daughter. How could she let him control her?
	She will revenge for her mother!
	"Haha, it’s true that you are my sister......" Chris Lockwood laughs. Then he talks with other people in French, Jamie Moore doesn’t hear him very well.
	After a while, Chris Lockwood says to Jamie Moore apologetically, "Jamie Moore, it's too busy here. When you finish your business, you can come back and help me."
	"Good, but it depends on my mood." Jamie Moore frowns. She doesn’t feel the sadness in Chris Lockwood's words, and then they hang up after chatting for a while.
	"Miss Jamie." As soon as she gets up, she sees Cindy Swift walking to her in a hurry.
	"What's the matter, Cindy Swift?" Jamie Moore is a little surprised. What would make Cindy Swift in such a panic?
	"Miss Jack, your father is looking for you at the door. Do you want to see him?" Cindy Swift says in a respect way. Now Jamie Moore has Ian Moore, she would be Mrs. William soon or later.
	
Chapter 108 The Appearance of Jozo
	Cindy Swift knows everything well. Anyone will know the attitude of Dan William towards Jamie Moore and Ian Moore. No one would be Mrs. William except Jamie Moore.
	Jack Moore?
	Jamie Moore raises her eyes in surprise. "No, I'll go out to see him."
	She can’t bring Jack Moore in. Who knows what he wants to do?
	It’s true that Jack Moore waits her outside, but he sits in a Lincoln. He is not exposed under the sun at all.
	Jamie Moore is not in a hurry. There is still a distance from the main entrance of the manor and the villa. She comes to the entrance in a patrol car.
	The guards at the door know her well, thus they don’t stop her, and they let her go easily.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore walks out of the car, Jack Moore scans the manor behind Jamie Moore and then he looks at Jamie Moore.
	"What’s the matter?" Jamie Moore doesn’t care Jack Moore’s contemptuous eyes, and then she asks directly.
	"Where's Mia? Has she been taken away by you and Mr. William?" Jack Moore asks her directly--Where is Mia Moore?
	Jamie Moore only wants to laugh. She is not a roundworm in Mia Moore's stomach. How can she know where she has gone?
	"I don't know." Jamie Moore says calmly. It’s really funny. Mia Moore kidnaps her and she even leaves so many scars on her. She doesn’t find trouble with her. How could he find trouble with her first?
	She doesn't think Jack Moore would be so kind. He will never pay for the medical expenses of her.
	"Don’t you know Mia has disappeared for several days? Jack Moore says angrily. Now he is very angry. Jamie Moore doesn’t know the reason for his anger. Maybe it’s for the attitude of Jamie Moore, or for the disappearance of Mia Moore.
	"She has hands and legs. What’s the matter with me?” Jamie Moore's eyes are full of disdain. "Since she has disappeared, why don’t you send some people to find her? Why don’t you come here to find me? If someone doesn’t know the fact, they may think I support a pet that keeps barking."
	Jamie Moore’s words means that Jack Moore is a pet like dog.
	Jack Moore’s face becomes gloomy. He is very angry now. He never expects that Jamie Moore would talk to him like this.
	Jack Moore calm down after a long time.
	"Mia kidnaps you before she disappeared, but now she is missing, and you stay here well. It's you and Mr. William who locks Mia up. This thing must be done by you two.” Jack Moore cares about Mai more, thus he persuades Jamie Moore. “Even though Mia Moore did something wrong, she is still young. As a sister, can't you be more considerate? Do you really want to have a stiff relationship with her? It's not good for you either. "
	In the end, Jack Moore says in a threat way.
	The expression of Jamie Moore is very cold, and she is not fright at all. “Is she young? Are you kidding with me? She born only a few months later than I. she is twenty years old. Is she young? What’s the meaning of being old in your eyes? Like you who have put half your foot in the coffin?”
	Put half your foot in the coffin?
	"You, what are you talking about? Do you curse your father like that?" Jack Moore is very angry. He points at Jamie Moore and raise a hand to comfort his chest.
	"I tell you now. If you don't hand Mia over to me, don't blame that I will do something bad to you!”
	Jamie Moore smiles, and she doesn’t care about this, “You come to meet me when Dan William is not at home. It proves that you want to threaten me? And I will follow your words for fear, am I right?”
	Jack Moore is a little surprised.
	"I'd like to see how ruthless you are? If you have the ability, you could say this in front of Dan William. Why are you saying this thing to me?” Jamie Moore says in a merciless way, and Jack Moore even doesn’t know how to replies.
	She doesn’t have any strong ability, but she is good at talking.
	What’s more, Jack Moore is such a bad person. So she has no fear to him.
	"You! If you are still the daughter of the Moore family, you must obey my order!" Jack Moore is very angry, thus he says in an incoherent way.
	"Then you could not treat me as the daughter of Mia Family.” Jamie Moore shrugs the shoulder, and then she turns to leaves away.
	"Are you clear? If you don’t have the status of Miss Jamie, do you think Dan William love you?" Jack Moore says in a gloomy way. It seems that he is sure Jamie Moore will look back.
	Jamie Moore smiles suddenly.
	"If Dan William wants to make friends with the Moore Family, it's not easier to get close to Mia Moore. After all, in your eyes, only she is your daughter."
	It’s not because Jamie Moore believe Dan William, but because she understand Dan William well. He would never commit himself to the Moore Family for a little profit. He has an innate sense of pride and superiority, thus he would not allow himself to do so. What's more, the Moore Family is not qualified to catch his attention.
	Jack Moore looks at the delicate face of Jamie Moore. No one could ignore the arrogant temperament around Jamie Moore. Especially, no one could ignore the bright eyes of her. In a trance, the face of Jamie Moore overlaps with the face of Adele Gilbert.
	Adele Gilbert, he used to be crazy about her.
	It's a deep memory that can't be said.
	Jack Moore doesn’t say anything, and then he returns back to the car. He is in a hurry and panic.
	Jamie Moore frowns slightly. She is a little puzzled. But the hatred in her heart does not dissipate with his departure.
	Adele Gilbert once told her, if you hate a person, you should show no care to him. Then you should give him a fatal blow when he is in a comfortable way.
	No one can stop her in killing Jack Moore. No one could stop her.
	Jamie Moore never expects that Jack Moore's revenge would come so quickly, which surprised her.
	In the CR building, Dan William just finishes a meeting in the top conference room. He sits in the conference room and pinches his tired brow with his hand. The expression on his handsome face gradually relaxed. In order to be able to stay at home with Jamie Moore and Ian Moore, he has sorted out almost all the affairs of the company that he needs to deal with in person these days. The rest can be completely handed over to Secretary Sam.
	When he thinks the young and lovely face of Ian Moore and the mart and lively face of Jamie Moore, he feels very warm in his heart.
	It’s very good if the thing keep like this.
	At that time, Secretary Sam comes in with mobile phone in his hand and says, "Mr. William, it’s a call from France."
	France?
	Is that the man?
	Dan William raises his eyes slightly. The light flashed in his eyes, and the he stands up and walks to the window to answer the phone.
	From this angle, one could see all the scene of this city. The buildings in front of him are different in height, shining in the sunshine.
	"Dan William." Dan William hears a sweet and soft voice. The voice is full of attachment and dependence and joy. "I've come to country C. I just get off the plane, would you like to pick me up?"
	"Jozo, how can you come back suddenly?" Dan William frowns, and his voice is very serious.
	"What’s the matter? Don’t you welcome me?" Jozo smiles and she says in a funny way.
	
Chapter 109 I Want to Marry You
	"Of course not. Where are you? I'll pick you up now." Dan William picks up the suit coat on the back of the chair and then walks out as he says, "Well, stay at there, and I will pick you up now."
	...
	The black Bugatti cruises smoothly on the road, and the streamlined body of the car shining in the sun.
	Jozo sits in the front passenger seat. She wears the fashionable blue dress. She has a curled hair, which up to her shoulder. She has a delicate face and she is very beautiful. She wears light makeup and honey colored lip gloss. Every action of her is very beautiful.
	She smiles sweetly. She looks very smart, and the smile is simple and harmless.
	Dan William holds the steering wheel tightly. He looks at the Jozo who sits beside him. He feels very guilt, and that feeling just like that he is covered by a big net, which makes him breathless.
	"Where are we going?" Jozo asks. She puts the hair around her cheek to her ear, and she looks like a little girl.
	"The hotel is not safe. Come back to the villa with me." Dan William says to Jozo softly.
	The face of Jozo suddenly become red. She looks at the man beside her, and her heart jumps quickly.
	"Why did you come back to country C for this time?" Dan William asks suddenly.
	"Because I want to see you. I feel very lonely in France, don’t you know?” Jozo says softly. She presses her lips, and she looks very lovely.
	Dan William automatically ignores the first sentence of Jozo, and then he says, "Alma will accompany you, will she?"
	Alma is Jozo's close maid. In order to take good care of Jozo's legs, Dan William asks Derek William to pick Alma from the training camp to take care of her.
	Jozo presses her lips, and then she looks at Jozo who sits in the back seat through the rear mirror. Then she suddenly reminds of something, and says, “Dan, do you remember the three wishes you give me? Now I've figured out what I want for my third wish."
	Dan William frowns and then he remembers of the thing, “You could tell me.”
	"I want to marry you." Jozo says with smiles, and her eyes are full of the glow of self-confidence.
	The eyesight of Dan William suddenly becomes dark, and no one knows his thinking.
	Marry him?
	In the night, the manor is full of lights. All the street lights on the red maple path are turned on, giving off warm orange light. Looking through the cascading branches and leaves, the white buildings in the manor are like a dream in the night.
	It's nine o'clock.
	Jamie Moore lies on the sofa, and she is watching TV. But she always wants to look at the door. Why Dan William hasn't come back?
	"Mommy, I will go to sleep now. Mommy also needs to go to bed early. Don't watch too late." Ian Moore says when he walks to the stairway. He rubs his eyes. In fact, he is a little dizzy, but he doesn't want Jamie Moore to worry about it. Maybe he will be OK after sleeping.
	"Good night, baby." Jamie Moore sends a kiss to Ian Moore. Seeing Ian Moore walks away, Jamie Moore watches TV again.
	She looks at the clock on the wall, and her expression suddenly becomes a little trance.
	She doesn’t know why she stays up. Maybe she cares the words of Jack Moore today. After all, she is still the eldest lady of the Moore's family in the eyes of outsiders.
	But she knows that this is not the true reason.
	Or maybe she is just waiting a man that she doesn’t want to admit.
	Time does not slow down because of waiting, but it seems to flow faster because of waiting.
	On the other side, Dan William stays in another villa of the manor. He specially chooses the farthest villa of the manor for Jozo. He looks at the dim moonlight out of the window. And he is thinking of something.
	"Dan William, will you stay with me tonight?" Jozo sits in her wheelchair, and Alma pushes her over. She says in a sweet voice, and the wheelchair stops in front of Dan William.
	Dan William smiles at her. He looks at the broken legs of Jozo completely. These disabled legs are also the punishment for his mistakes.
	At that year, Jamie Moore goes to abroad, and he feels very sad.
	When he walks out of the door, he thinks he sees Jamie Moore, thus he wants to catch her up. But he forgets that the front is the road, thus he is almost knocked down by the running car.
	At that time, Jozo just passes by, and she pushes him aside, which saves the life of him. But she can’t stand up and walk for that accident.
	No one would make fun of the safety of his life. What’s more, Dan William doesn’t know Jozo at that time.
	The image of Jozo's injury constantly appeared in his mind. He feels very guilt for this.
	Dan William suddenly reminds the smiling face of Jamie Moore, and then he shakes his head, “I still have thing to do, and I will come to see you another day."
	Jozo hides the disappointed in her eyes, and then she says unhappily, "OK..."
	"Well, you should take a good rest now. Don't be tired. Alma, take good care of Miss Jozo." Dan William says.
	"Yes, younger master." Alma is the right-hand of Dan William before she is send to take care of Jozo. She is a girl who always keeps silent, but she is very loyal.
	Dan William nods and then he walks away.
	Jozo suddenly grabs his knee and then she bends down with a scream, and she looks very pain.
	"Pain..." Jozo grasps her knee tightly, and the delicate face of her is full of sweet. Hearing Jozo’s voice, Dan William stops, and then he walks to Jozo without any hesitation.
	"What's the matter?" Dan William squats down and looks at the legs of Jozo anxiously.
	Jozo leans on Dan William's shoulder and says weakly, "I don't know. I feel pain on my leg suddenly. It’s very painful...Dan. I'm afraid. Will I lose my leg?"
	The eyesight of Dan William is very complicated, and then he looks at her with relief. "No, I'm here. I won't let you have anything. I'll call the doctor now."
	Jozo leans on the shoulder of Dan William and then she nods. She doesn’t refuse this, and now she looks very kind.
	Alma looks at Jozo coldly, but she doesn’t poke the idea of Jozo.
	Dr. Slater comes to the villa soon, and then he makes a series of check for Jozo. She looks very good, and Jozo has been unable to walk for several years. She feels very pain sometime, but there would be no further damage.
	But Dan William still worries about this. Thus he asks Alma to make up a room for Dr. Slater to prevent other accidents.
	After checking, Jozo lies on the bed of the room. She puts her hand on the side of the bed, and the image looks beautiful.
	
Chapter 110 Ian Moore is Ill
	Dan William frowns as he looks at the sleeping face of Jozo. If something bad happens to her, he will feel guilt all his life.
	After covering the quilt for Jozo well, Dan William looks at her for a while, and then he is ready to leave.
	But Jozo wakes up suddenly, or maybe she doesn’t fall asleep at all. He looks at Dan William in a plead way. She holds Dan William’s hand and says, “Can you stay with me? I’m afraid...”
	"OK, I will stay here." Dan William answers. His eyes become dim under the light, and his long and straight body seems to be lonely, which is unspeakable.
	Jozo finally smiles contentedly and she still holds Dan William’s hand, and then she fall asleep.
	Dan William looks out of the window. The moon is thick. At this time, she should have fall sleep. There are Cindy Swift and bodyguards in the manor. There won't be any problem.
	When Jozo falls asleep, she lets Dan William’s hand go. But Dan William doesn’t leave. Since he promises that he will not leave, he will do it.
	He walks out of the room, and then he takes a shower in another room, thus he doesn’t hear the ring of his phone.
	In the midnight, Jamie Moore goes to upstairs and she is ready to sleep. Then she walks to the room of Ian Moore and she opens the door. She sees the small body of Ian Moore by the moonlight.
	Jamie Moore feels soft in her heart. Recently, it seems that she has ignored him. Thus she walks in gently. She walks to the bed, and covers the quilt for him well. But when she touches the face of Ian Moore, she suddenly feels that the temperature of Ian Moore’s face is very high.
	How could the temperature of his body be so high?
	Jamie Moore turns the light on immediately with the remote control, and the she finds the face of Ian Moore is very red. And his hair is wet. He frowns, and it seems that he is very uncomfortable.
	Jamie Moore feels pain in her heart, but she dares not to wake Ian Moore up, thus she touches the temperature of Ian Moore.
	It’s so hot!
	The temperature is very high, and Jamie Moore is worried about this. Thus she withdraws her hand suddenly.
	She stands up and runs to the outside. She goes to downstairs to find Cindy Swift. She says in a trembling and choking way, “Cindy Swift, please help me call a doctor. Ian Moore has a fever!"
	It’s the first time for Jamie Moore to call the name of Ian Moore in the outsiders. She is used to call Ian Moore baby or Bunny.
	The face of Cindy Swift also changes suddenly, and then she comforts Jamie Moore, “Miss Jamie, I will call Dr. Slater now. If he is here, the little younger master will be fine."
	Jamie Moore nods. The whole body of her is shivering for fear. But she tries all her efforts to calm herself down.
	Cindy Swift gives a phone to Dr. Slater, but other people tell her that Dr. Slater is not in the manor, and now Dr. Slater stay in the another villa of the manor, and he need to take care of another people there. But she doesn’t know who that person.
	Hearing that Dr. Slater stays with Dan William, she calls Dan William immediately.
	But Dan William doesn’t answer the phone. It seems that Jamie Moore’s heart is caught by a big hand. When she reminds the red and painful face of Ian Moore, Jamie Moore feels that the whole world of her collapsed.
	But she needs to calm down, and she needs to calm down...
	Finally, the phone is connected, thus Jamie Moore’s eyes lights up. Then she hears a sweet voice, “Hello? Who is that speaking, please?”
	The eyesight of Jamie Moore becomes dark suddenly, and then she looks at the screen. It’s Dan William’s phone, but the man who answered the phone is a woman.
	She hangs up suddenly, and says, “Cindy Swift, prepare a car for me, and I need to go to the hospital."
	Cindy Swift doesn’t know what happened, but since they can’t find Dr. Slater, they need to go to the hospital. Hearing the order of Jamie Moore, she prepares the car for Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore runs to the upstairs and she comes to the room of Ian Moore. He holds Ian Moore gently. The whole body of him is sweet. Jamie Moore wears a cloth for Ian Moore, and then she walks downstairs with Ian Moore in her arm.
	Cindy Swift does the thing quickly, and the car has waited them outside. When Jamie Moore walks to the door, Cindy Swift opens the door of the car. When Jamie Moore sits in, Cindy Swift also sits in.
	When the car leaves the manor, it drives to the hospital quickly. Jamie Moore keeps silent all the way, and she just changes the clean clothes for Ian Moore quite.
	Cindy Swift doesn’t know what happened right now. She just knows Dan William is not here, which is not appropriate.
	They arrive at the hospital quickly. When the car stops, Cindy Swift goes to register for Ian Moore quickly. As long as she takes the name of Dan William out, no one will ignore them.
	"He has a fever of 40 degrees. Now the fever is under control. If you come back later, he will be mentally retarded. How can you be a parent?" The doctor reproaches Jamie Moore as he records.
	"How can you talk to our young lady in such a way...?” Seeing this, Cindy Swift argues for Jamie Moore.
	"Cindy Swift." Jamie Moore gives Cindy Swift a look, and then she looks at the doctor apologetically. "I'm sorry, doctor. I'll pay attention to this later."
	She doesn't expect that Ian Moore would have a fever in such a short time, and he even catches such a heavy fever.
	The doctor looks at her and then says, “You should check for the list first. And he could leave the hospital when the condition is better."
	"OK, OK. Thank you, doctor." Jamie Moore has never thought that the doctor is so cute. She hates hospitals since she is a child. The person she afraid most is the doctor.
	Because of the background of the William Family, Ian Moore is sent to the advanced intensive care unit.
	Jamie Moore walks to the ward quietly. The ward is white, and the ward is full of the strong smelling of disinfectant fluid. It’s so quiet that one could only hear the sound of gentle breathing.
	Usually, Ian Moore is full of energetic, but now his face is pale. He lies on the bed and he is in the infusion, which makes her heart ache
	Jamie Moore sits on the bedside, and she touches the face of Ian Moore with her hand. Now the temperature is not so high, thus she calms down gradually.
	On the other side, Dan William doesn’t finds his mobile phone, thus he returns back to the master bedroom and prepares to take the phone back.
	Jozo sleeps soundly, and she doesn’t wakes up when Dan William walks in.
	Dan William subconsciously opens the screen of phone, and then he sees several missed calls. He clicks on the screen and sees that it’s Cindy Swift who called him except one call from Jamie Moore.
	There's more than one.
	Dan William frowns, and then he looks at Jozo who sits on the bed. And then he walks out to call Cindy Swift.
	As soon as he leaves, Jozo, who sleeps on the bed, opens her eyes.
	"Cindy Swift, what's the matter?" Dan William returns to the other room, and then he leans against the bed and asks.
	His right eye jumps suddenly for a few times. His intuition told him that something bad had happened.

Chapter 111 Be Angry
	"Young master, you finally answer the phone. The young master has a fever. He is still lying in the hospital!" Cindy Swift says in a reproachful voice. She stays with Dan William since Dan William is very young, and she knows that Dan William does not care about this.
	Ian Moore!
	Dan William’s heart jumps quickly, and he wears clothes as he says, "where is the hospital?"
	"In the Central Hospital, the young master is not very well. Miss Moore is very worried..." The phone hung up before Cindy Swift finishes her words. She smiles when she finds the phone hung up. Now the younger master knows Jamie Moore is unhappy. Since the younger master is so anxious, he must cares about Miss Moore and the little younger master.
	After changing clothes, Dan William picks the key up and then walks out.
	Dan William has long legs, thus he could walks quickly. He walks to the downstairs quickly. He gets on the car and then the car disappears in the moonlight.
	Jozo stands beside the window, and watches the car of Dan William disappears. Her eyes are full of reluctance.
	He promises that he would stay with her.
	Is it because the phone from that woman? Jozo thinks for a while, and she reminds the name of that woman is Jamie!
	Who is that woman?
	Jozo holds the curtain of the window tightly, and her hands turn pale. Dan William could forget the appointment with her when he receives that call. She is very curious about that woman.
	Cindy Swift doesn’t know the thing happened in that manor.
	Dan William drives quickly. He also arrives in the hospital in the shortest time for this.
	After inquiring from the front desk of the hospital, Dan William comes to the floor. When Cindy Swift sees Dan William comes to the door of Ian Moore's ward, Cindy Swift, who is waiting at the door, reliefs after seeing Dan William.
	"Young master, finally, you come here." Cindy Swift is worried. She knows that Jamie Moore gets angry with Dan William.
	After all, the child has a fever, but his father disappears. Anyone will be angry.
	The more Cindy Swift thinks about it, the more she feels aggrieved. Moreover, Jamie Moore has given birth to such a lovely and attractive child to the William family.
	If the master and his wife meet Ian Moore and Jamie Moore, they will be very happy.
	Dan William doesn’t say anything. He presses his lips, and then he sees Jamie Moore who sits beside the bed from the half-opened door. She lowers her head to take good care of Ian Moore, and no one could see the expression of her.
	He feels very pain in his heart. Suddenly, he feels regret that he ignores Jamie Moore and Ian Moore for accompanying Jozo.
	Even though he feels regrets for Jozo, Jamie Moore and Ian Moore are more important in his heart.
	He pushes the door, and then walks in. Jamie Moore doesn’t look at Dan William. She lowers her head, and no one could see the expression of her.
	Seeing Ian Moor who lies on the bed, Dan William feels more painful. It seems that she has lost something, thus he is very panic.
	He walks behind Jamie Moore, and then he puts his hands on her shoulders. He could feel that Jamie Moore is shivering and she even shows resistance to him, so she quietly avoids his touch.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore in a confused way. Dan William thinks that Jamie Moore may be worried about this, “Don't worry, our baby will be OK."
	It’s very quiet in the ward. After a long time, Jamie Moore looks at the pale face of Ian Moore, and then she says softly, “Of course, you don't need to worry about this. It’s enough for my son to have me. You can go now."
	The atmosphere is suddenly full of tension for the words of Jamie Moore. Dan William frowns, and he looks very unhappy. Jamie Moore says to him in such a way, and it seems that she wants to get rid of the relationship with him.
	Thus he feels more upset.
	"What are you doing?" Dan William doesn’t know Jozo has answered his phone, thus he doesn’t know why Jamie Moore is angry.
	Jamie Moore smiles, but Dan William thinks Jamie Moore’s smile is very ironic, “You should think that I have a bad temper. We don’t need to continue our rules. When the baby gets better, I'll take him out of your manor."
	"Will he agree for this?" Dan William looks at Jamie Moore coldly. Hearing Jamie Moore’s words, Dan William feels that he will lose everything.
	"I'm his mommy. He'll listen to me." Jamie Moore stands up, and then she stays away from the hospital bed. She dares to disturb Ian Moore's rest.
	Her eyes are full of stubbornness and stubbornness, and she refuses to give in.
	She smiles ironically when she reminds the sweet voice from the phone. He doesn’t obey the second rule. Thus there is no need to obey the rules with Dan William.
	Jamie Moore is very angry, and she doesn’t know how do, so she feels very uncomfortable.
	Dan William stares at the face of Jamie Moore. Tonight, Jamie Moore is different, but he doesn’t know the difference. In other words, even though she is very angry, she will not get rid of the relationship with him so quickly.
	What happened? Dan William presses his lips, and he feels helplessness in his eyes. He holds her chin and says, "Are you angry with me now?"
	Jamie Moore is very surprised. She talks to him in such a serious way. When does she get angry with him? Now Jamie Moore is in a bad mood, and she wants to vent all the anger out from her heart.
	Jamie Moore is in such a mood.
	"Do I lose my temper? You have to ask yourself what you did first."
	"Do you still remember the second rule in our appointment? If you say that I am angry because you stay with a woman tonight and you even transfer the doctor to see that woman, and you even ignore Ian Moore, then I will not admit this. Who are you?” Jamie Moore looks at Dan William directly. She doesn’t know where she gets this courage, thus she dares to say these words with Dan William.
	She only knows that she is very angry now, thus she says in an angry way.
	In fact, Jamie Moore doesn’t want to get angry with him, but she feels very uncomfortable. She feels very uncomfortable!
	Dan William thinks for a while. Is the woman in Jamie Moore’s mouth Jozo?
	But she doesn’t know the existence of Jozo. Originally, he wants to let Jozo stay at Country C for a short time, and then he will send her back to France. In this way, Jamie Moore will not meet Jozo, and there will be no problem.
	He never expects that Jamie Moore would know the existence of Jozo, which breaks his plan.
	So, is she jealous now?
	Dan William smiles, and then he says, “Jamie Moore, you are jealous of this.”
	He says in a firm way.
	Jamie Moore's face is slightly stiff. Why can he call Jamie after staying with another woman for such a long time?
	Does he think she has a good temper?
	"Never!" Jamie Moore puffs her cheek, and she tries all her efforts to get rid of Dan William’s control. If Ian Moore does not have a rest in the ward, she will kick Dan William out immediately.
Chapter 112 Believe
	"Oh? Jamie, don’t you believe it?" Dan William is not angry. Instead, he is in a better mood, and his eyes are full of light.
	Jamie gets angry when she sees he stays with Jozo. This proves that she likes him in her heart.
	Dan William is sure about this.
	"You are good at duplicating! If you continue to say this, I will bite you.” Jamie Moore's face turns red like a child who exposes her mind, but she wants to cover it up with bad words.
	"If you like to do this, you can bite me." Dan William says with a smile. His cold face looks soft than before. He says rogue words to Jamie Moore, but it’s not annoying at all.
	Bite, bite, I will bite you to death!
	Thinking of here, Jamie Moore holds Dan William’s arm, and then she bites heavily under the loving eyesight of Dan William!
	She bites heavily, and she even could feel the smell of blood in her mouth.
	Dan William just frowns, and he doesn’t say anything. He looks at Jamie Moore with loving eyesight.
	If it is not Jamie Moore, Dan William will throw the woman out immediately. How can he allow himself to be bitten by others?
	In fact, Dan William has always been very indulgent to Jamie Moore, but sometimes, Jamie Moore really can't see it, and she also can't think of it.
	Or she dares not to think about this.
	In Ian Moore's words, Jamie Moore always is so heartless.
	It’s still a long way for Dan William to stay with Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore bites for a while. Then she opens her mouth when she feels the smell of blood in her mouth. She takes a few steps back and wipes the blood on the corner of his mouth.
	When she sees the bloodshed bite mark on his arm, her eyes are shining slightly. She feels pain in her heart, and then she presses her lips.
	"Are you still angry?" Dan William never is so humble to anyone.
	Now he constantly breaks through his own bottom line and controls his patience for the woman in front of him. He loves her, so he always thinks it's a matter of course.
	Dan William, he is not the young and willful youth. After five years of tempering, he grows up and he loves her more.
	He never forgets Jamie Moore, and even now he keeps the white shirt that Jamie Moore bites.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. Even though she is stupid, she could feel that Dan William is indulgence to her. She once feels this indulgence.
	She doesn't mean to ignore Dan William's indulgence, but now, it's impossible to say that she is not moved by this.
	Seeing eyes of Jamie Moore have no stubborn, Dan William signs. He walks to Jamie Moore and she rubs her hair and says, "The woman you said is Jozo. She just comes to country C from France. For her, I am very guilty. Except this, there is no relationship between her and me."
	Jamie Moore looks at Dan William in a surprised way.
	Does he explain this to me?
	Dan William is a man who hates to say many words. How could he explain this to her?
	"Listen, everyone in the world could show doubt on me, but you can't." His eyes are very dark, and it’s just like the magnetic field, which attracts Jamie Moore. Thus Jamie Moore can’t ignore him.
	Even if everyone in the world misunderstands him and shows doubt on him, he would not care about it. But he cares about the words from Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore believes Dan William when Dan William explains the thing to her. He is so proud, so he hates telling lies.
	It's like you have the whole world. It's just the right warmth.
	"Dan William." Jamie sniffs and then she says stiffly, "You forget to change your shoes before you come here."
	What？
	Dan William doesn’t expect that Jamie Moore’s thinking would change so fast. It is not easy for her to say such moving words. How could she just show focus on her shoes?
	Thus he lowers his head to see his shoes. Sure enough, he still wears a pair of indoor slippers. The expression on his face suddenly changed, and there is an unnatural flush on his ears.
	"It’s none of your business." All of a sudden, he turns his head around, and his ear become redder than before.
	Jamie Moore laughs suddenly. Dan William’s face becomes red. It’s rare to see this.
	What’s more, he even forgets to change shoes, which is quite different from his meticulous and neat style. It can be seen how worried he is at that time, thus he makes such a mistake.
	Think of here, Jamie Moore feels that the haze in his heart had dissipated and the smile on his face was gradually warming up.
	"What do you blush for? I don't do anything bad to you." Although Jamie Moore knows that Dan William is ashamed at the moment, Jamie Moore still says it deliberately, and she even hopes to take photo with her mobile phone.
	"Jamie Moore! Even though you don't talk, nobody thinks you're dumb!" Dan William is very angry and he stares at Jamie Moore.
	"OK, it doesn’t matter. It’s you face turn red. It's not against the law." Jamie Moore glances at him lightly, and her eyes are full of smile. She walks to the bed and sits on the chair.
	Dan William, "..."
	Ian Moore is still sleep, and he breathes steadily, and his face is not so pale. He is turning better.
	"I'm going to let Derek William to go through the discharge formalities. Slater's medical skills are better than those of these hospitals. With his care, the baby will be better." After this time, Dan William has made a decision.
	From now on, Dr. Slater can only stand by in the manor in case of special circumstances. No matter who he is, he will not open special cases, including Jozo.
	He can invite the best medical team in the world to treat her legs, but he will never let Dr. Slater leave the manor. He will never put people around him in danger again. Fortunately, Ian Moore is turning better.
	"Isn't Dr. Slater treating that woman? Is that good?" Jamie Moore covers the quilt for Ian Moore as she says.
	Dan William coughs softly, and then he looks at Ian Moore with guilt and heartache, "No, this kind of thing will never happen again."
	If Dr. Slater is here tonight, Ian Moore won't have to be sent to the hospital at all. He will be able to jump around soon.
	Tonight's decision is a mistake.
	“Um.” Jamie Moore answers, and she doesn’t pay attention to his words.
	Up to now, she firmly believes that all promises and guarantees are untrustworthy before things happen. Only then can she choose to believe or not.
	Nevertheless, the words of Dan William reassured Jamie Moore.
	Ian Moore is taken back to the manor. Dr. Slater takes care of him, thus Ian Moore soon recovered.
	Ian Moore feels that he has lost his face when he thinks of the reason.
	In fact, the reason why he would be ill is very simple. Recently, life is too comfortable. Ian Moore plays online games every night with Night.1. Although he will sleep before 12 o’clock, the school organizes the kindergarten to play in the water park before he was ill. Ian Moore has been soaking in the water for a long time, and he doesn’t pay much attention to prevention, thus he is ill.
Chapter 113 Daddy, You are so Great
	But in Ian Moore's eyes, it's a big failure. He always has a good body. He loves to eat anything. He seldom gets ill. But he is ill this time.
	However, Ian Moore dares not to tell the truth to his mommy and daddy. If they know the true reason, they will never let him play computer.
	Thus Ian Moore is very quiet in recently days. He seldom says something and he takes medicine to sleep, so as not to be asked by Jamie Moore and Dan William. Otherwise, he doesn’t know how to answer.
	Two years later, Ian Moore gets well. Under the condition of Dr. Slater, Ian Moore has recovered well. He is as active as before and he doesn’t show any discomfort.
	Jamie Moore is lying on the reclining chair on the roof, basking in the sun leisurely. These days, she is very nervous due to Ian Moore’s illness. Now she is free, thus she doesn’t want to move at all. Because of the worry toward Ian Moore, she doesn't even want to move a finger when she is free.
	This is the life for a true lazy.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes comfortably. Her delicate face is whiter under the sunshine. The leaf of the tree blocks the sun for her, thus she will not expose on the sun directly.
	At this moment, the front door of the manor opens, and a red Ferrari and a Maserati drives into the manor, and the car stops in the parking lot, and then two people get off the car.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field grow up together with Dan William.
	"Why did the two young masters come here? Are people in your family willing to let you leave home?" Dan William is playing golf and then he receives the call from Bruce Hill, and then he sees they come into the room.
	"Of course, it's the beautiful woman." Bruce Hill is the most uninhibited man of the three, and he likes beauty. He will never refuse all the beautiful girls with good figure.
	Bruce Hill Pure has made friends with pure, sexy, shy and proud woman.
	In contrast, Duke Field is a single-minded man. He could love a woman for five years, but he will not show his love easily.
	In Bruce Hill’s words, Duke Filed is an internally cunning man.
	"Come in." Dan William puts his hands in his pocket as he says. He leans against the wall, and he moves Bruce Hill’s hand away, and then he walks into the villa.
	"By the way, elder brother, don’t you know how annoying I am? My family always does things against me. They whisper in my ear everyone day. I hope someone could stop them." Bruce Hill complains as soon as he sits down.
	After making tea for them, Cindy Swift leaves the room. Duke Filed picks up a cup of tea and he shows no thinking to Bruce Hill’s words. “Stupid."
	Bruce Hill presses his lips, and he doesn’t care it, “Dan has the best achievement of us. If he is here, I will never fail in the exam even though I don't review."
	"Really. I remember I give you the answer, but you don’t want to copy it, thus you hand a white paper. Do you still remember it?" Dan William says slightly.
	"I'm hurt by this. I'm used to being beaten. If you don’t beat me, I will feel uncomfortable.” Bruce Hill picks the cup up to drink water.
	“...” Dan William.
	“...” Duke Filed
	"By the way, do you know what I saw last time when we eat in a barbecue with Duke Filed?" Bruce Hill says deliberately. But Dan William has no expression, and it seems that he has no interest in his words.
	Bruce Hill signs. It's really boring. Why doesn't he cooperate at all?
	“Duke sees a child, and that child looks like you! Do you feel strange about this? You don’t have a son, why does that child look like you...”
	"Daddy, help me!” Bruce is talking, and Duke Filed wants to stop him. But before he does something, the soft voice of Ian Moore comes into their ears.
	It's like a thunder. It's pounding on Bruce Hill and Duke Filed.
	Daddy?
	Where is the child?
	Bruce Hill and Duke Filed turns around, and then they see Ian Moore runs toward Dan William with something in his hand.
	A gasping patrol captain runs behind him.
	"Daddy, the strange uncle wants to take me away!” Ian Moore acts coquettishly to Dan William, and he complains the behavior of the patrol captain to Dan William. He doesn't think there is any problem with his coquettish behavior.
	When necessary, it's good to rely on daddy's big tree to enjoy the cool. Ian Moore thinks in his heart.
	The captain of the patrol who chases in looks ugly. How dare he to sell the young master? It's clear that the young master almost dismantled his car and he even takes down their patrol signs for play.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Filed are surprised. Dan William puts the hand on Ian Moore’s back, and then he pats on his back and says, “Don’t worry, daddy is here, and daddy will sell them first.”
	After finishing his words, he looks at the patrol captain and makes the patrol captain feel frightened, but the patrol captain still stands straightly.
	Ian Moore gives a thumb to Ian Moore in his heart. Daddy is great!
	The patrol captain's face become ugly, but he feels depressed. He really doesn't want to sell the young master!
	Dan William feels that something clasps his chest. He looks down and then he sees hold something in his hand.
	"Baby, what is this?" Dan William pokes Ian Moore’s small hand. His hand is very big, which is a sharp contrast with Ian Moore's small hand. His hand is soft and the feeling of touch is very good.
	Ian Moore looks at the thing in his hand, and then he opens his hand in the front of Dan William. He blinks his eyes and he smiles, “I get this from that cool car. I want to make this into a pendant and hang it on my schoolbag."
	He holds the stone like badge under the sun, and the badge shining under the sunshine.
	What? Hanging ornaments? The captain of the patrol is very angry. His badge symbolizes glory, but it’s not easy to get it. All the members of the patrol only have one piece.
	He gets this at training camp, and only the best performers are eligible for the badge.
	Ian Moore gets this badge from that modified patrol car. This thing is inlaid on the car tightly. But Ian Moore holds it tightly, thus he pulls it off!
	The members of the collective patrol are speechless...
	Dan William looks at the thing in Ian Moore’s hand. His son is so discerning. He doesn't want anything. He just wants something that doesn't look good but has profound meaning.
	"Young master, this..." The captain of the patrol looks very bad. If the young master wants him to give the badge to the young master, it's...
	Bruce Hill and Duke Filed look at Dan William, and they want to know how Dan William will solve this problem.
Chapter 114 Ian Moore’s Mommy
	But Dan just pinches Ian Moore's face gently, with gentle and soft voice, "Honey, do you know what this thing is made of?"
	How could it be known? Bruce rolled his eyes at Dan. Bro, it's too difficult for kids to ask.
	Ian Moore looks at the stone and says, "Of course, obsidian, right? This kind of stone is very hard, and must have taken a lot of hard work and time to make a badge. "
	Finally, Ian Moore knows what Dan means. This stone is hard-won. He wants to return to the strange guy.
	Bruce looks at Ian Moore in surprise and thinks for a while. How could this little kid know so much?
	Ian Moore puts it in his hands and plays for a few times. Although he is reluctant to return to him, Jamie tells him that he cannot take anything that is not his own, even if he liked it. So Ian Moore has no complaints.
	"Sir, here you are." Ian Moore goes to the patrol leader and hands the badge to him.
	The captain of the patrol takes a look at Dan and finds that he is not unhappy at all. Instead, he is very satisfied with Ian Moore’s action. So he takes it down. "Thank you, young master."
	"You're welcome. Ian Moore will drive the cool car and go for a stroll with the beauty like you in the future." Ian Moore’s lovely face suddenly burst into a smile, and directly points out the matter of the patrol captain carrying the beautiful maid in the manor to patrol.
	Recently, there is too little fun, so Ian Moore can only make some fun by himself.
	As soon as the captain's face changes, he gives a look to the man sitting on the sofa with a cold expression, with a bad premonition in his heart.
	"Ha ha, Dan, this is your child indeed. It's the same insidious... smart as you." Bruce originally wants to say insidious, but when he receives Dan's angry eyes, he immediately changes his words.
	The more Bruce sees Ian Moore, the more he loves the children. Although he has a big family with many family members, he has never seen such a child as clever and lovely as Ian Moore, who is totally the same as young Dan.
	With a totally lovely but harmless face, but what Ian Moore says can often grasp the point, can successfully let that person be punished!
	It was exactly the same as when Bruce grabbed Jamie's sugar in their young age, and Dan mentioned to his parents that Bruce made troubles in school and finally be punished.
	Bruce is so excited. He immediately wants to clasp Ian Moore and look at him carefully.
	"What do you want to do? Uncle, do you want to sell Ian Moore?" Ian Moore looks at Bruce with his big eyes, who is staring at him, puzzled.
	Bruce's face is surprised. Uncle? Does he look so old?
	"Your name is Ian Moore? I'm your father's good friend. You can call me handsome brother." Bruce says narcissistically.
	Ian Moore just looks at him contemptuously, and then said, "Are you more handsome than my daddy?"
	Bruce is stunned. Unexpectedly, Ian Moore will ask in such a way. Bruce shakes his head, because Dan is still cleverer.
	"Are you richer than my Daddy?"
	Bruce continues to shake his head and make joke with Ian Moore. Your Daddy is in charge of most of the country, who can compare with him in wealth?
	"That's it, you are neither more handsome nor richer than my father, then you still let me call you handsome brother, do you want to take my advantage?" Ian Moore's point of view is too logical to refute.
	Listen to call him repeatedly, Dan is very proud.
	Bruce looks at Duke, "They are even the same in the way of speaking."
	Duke smiles and says, "Let your mouth be closed. Even children despise you now."
	"Who is the mother of the child?" Duke looks at Dan.
	Bruce also looks at Dan curiously.
	Dan chuckles, and then says, "you will know in a moment."
	Bruce hears this discontented answer, then stares at Ian Moore, "Ian Moore, tell me, who is your mommy?"
	He worries that he would be despised by Ian Moore again, if let him call himself handsome guy.
	However, Ian Moore learns how to Dan said, "You will know in a moment."
	Poop.
	Bruce and Duke are suddenly amused by his serious appearance. Unexpectedly, they makes so mysterious. They became more and more curious.
	Soon it is twelve o'clock, lunch time.
	Candy is ready for dinner. Ian Moore sits on the left side of Dan. Bruce sits opposite Duke, but Dan's right side is empty.
	Bruce and Duke vaguely guess who is given this position.
	There is a clear clattering sound at the revolving stairs. When Dan looks at the stairs, he just sees Jamie just turning down the stairs.
	As she walks down the stairs, she tie up her black, bright and soft hair with a hair band, leaking her white neck.
	Her hair sways as she goes downstairs. A few strands of hair fall down mischievously, which makes the face more delicate and small. The eyes are flexible and lively. The whole person is young and vigorous, which immediately attracts the attention of the public.
	As soon as Jamie arrived downstairs, she looks up and sees Bruce and Duke, who are sitting at the dinner table and staring at her. She couldn't help wondering. Is there anything dirty on her face?
	"Mommy, here." Ian Moore calls out crisply, and determined Bruce and Duke's thoughts.
	Ian Moore's mother is this woman.
	But why does she give birth to a five-year-old son for Dan, but the two don't get married, and they also know this thing now?
	There must be a secret in this.
	Jamie smiles at them mildly. She goes to the right side of Dan and sits down. She is clear that why the two people would have a surprised expression, it is Ian Moore here.
	"Let's have dinner.” Dan says lightly, picks up the chopsticks and put some dishes in Ian Moore's bowl, and then put some in Jamie's bowl. These dishes are arranged according to Ian Moore’s and Jamie's taste. Have meat and vegetables combination. Jamie's favorite is meat.
	"Ja....Jamie"Bruce cries out. He wants to be call the name more closed. Suddenly he thinks of the Dan on the side. He changes his words immediately." Your son has grown up. When shall we receive your wedding invitation? "
	Fortunately, Jamie hasn't moved her chopsticks. Otherwise she might spit it out!
	Wedding invitation? Get married?
	How is this possible? Jamie bits a few pieces, puts some dishes into mouth, and don't care what Bruce say at all.
	Jamie doesn't care, but Ian Moore cares. He has only one wish now, that is, mom and dad can be together forever.
	Dan's eyes are bright and deep, like a lake with no bottom, and he smiles, "Get married?"
	
Chapter 115 Mommy was beaten by daddy?
	Maybe before that, he would deny this ridiculous idea, because he is not sure whether Jamie loves him or not, and his pride and self-esteem do not allow him to marry a woman who does not love himself.
	But now, Dan William looks at Ian Moore’s face, whose mouth filled with food. Then he looks at Jamie, who is eating and doesn't care about her image at all. He frowns. This woman, who has been leaving with her baby for so many years, it is time to pay off.
	How could he not marry her?
	Though so many thoughts flash in his heart, Dan William remains silent on his face, "there is no such idea yet."
	After hearing this, Jamie feels disappointed, but still pretends not to care about it and continues to eat.
	Bruce’s eyes looks at Dan William as if he is looking at a monster. Ian Moore is so big. Will it affect your children if you and Jamie Moore don't marry again? "
	Duke also looks puzzled. They could see Dan's feelings for Jamie. But now what is Dan William thinking?
	It has to be said that Dan’s mind is really hard to guess.
	"What do you think will be the impact in country C?" Dan William says that and he is quite confident. He peels the shrimp shells for Jamie and Ian Moore. The sauce covers his hands, but he doesn’t frown.
	Bruce is watering and looks at the fat shrimp in front of him. He is eager to ask Dan William when he learns to peel the shrimp!
	God, not mention to peel shrimps before, even orange is too lazy to peel by him.
	The man is still the man. Is this the kind of man who changes greatly when he has children?
	But Dan William does not do anything wrong. In country C, who dares to oppose him?
	"But don't you worry about others falling love with Jamie?" Duke says directly. Jamie looks like a girl in her early twenties. No matter where she goes, she is very attractive.
	It's unbelievable that Dan William doesn't worry.
	Dan William glances at Jamie lightly and quickly, reminding of Ryan Jack and Hooson in his mind.
	Instead of worrying, he has absolute confidence in himself.
	"There are many handsome men loves Mommy, but I will get rid of them with Mommy!" Ian Moore is afraid that Bruce's words and those of Duke would not stimulate Dan, and says deliberately.
	The cute little face is serious. Little fat hand holds a spoon and makes us laugh.
	Oh...
	Bruce couldn't help laughing. He reaches out his hands and pinches Ian Moore’s face. "How are you going to take your mommy to elope? Your father is very powerful. "
	Dan William is unhappy. He does not have rivals, but his son starts to grab Jamie.
	Dan William is depressed.
	Ian Moore looks at Bruce, uses a fork to pick up the fat prawns in his plate and peels the shells, swallows them at once, "I can't tell you, if I tell you, daddy will know that Ian Moore and mummy can't run anymore."
	Jamie gives Ian Moore a look of "my baby is really smart", and then eats more happily.
	"Ian Moore! Do you want to grab your mammy with me?" Dan William can't bear it. If he doesn't care about Ian Moore, he will knock on his forehead.
	"Mommy! This uncle is rude to me!" Ian Moore drops his knife and fork, jumps off the stool, and rushes to Jamie.
	Uncle? Bruce couldn't bear to laugh at Dan's expression. He is called uncle by his son. Dan's heart must be broken.
	"Darling, honey, don't be mad at your uncle. He may be menopause now." Jamie seems to be comforting Bunny, but obviously she is laughing at Dan.
	Bruce and Duke look at each other and move to the corner with their plates in tacit agreement, trying to reduce their sense of existence and not participate in the disturbing here.
	"Jamie! Are you wanted to be beaten?" Dan William pretends very angry.
	"What? Do you dare to provoke me? I'll sue you for domestic violence!" Jamie stares back and hugs Ian Moore.
	Dan William immediately smiles, deadly enchanting, "domestic violence? I'll show you what domestic violence is! "
	And he pulls her by the wrist to drag her upstairs.
	Ian Moore doesn't catch up either. He looks at the back of Dan William pulling Jamie away and covers her mouth and chuckles.
	"Ian Moore, don't you want to follow up and see what your father and mother are doing?" Bruce goes to Ian Moore and squats down to look at him.
	Ian Moore proudly raises his chin. "I don't want to, uncle. You can just say it if you want to see it. I won't despise you."
	‘I just despise you.’
	Bruce touches his nose awkwardly. Ian Moore sees through his mind and talks to him all over his face, but his shamelessness is good for this. "Uncle just worries that your daddy would hit your mommy? Ian Moore, think about it. If your mommy is beat by your daddy's, then your mommy will leave your cruel daddy. Doesn't Ian Moore want to have another little sister?"
	Ian Moore tilts his head and thinks while listening. Bruce makes him unable to refute!
	"Then what should we do?"
	"To stop your father, of course!" Bruce’s advice is to cheat Ian Moore.
	"Uncle, don't you think Ian Moore is a fool? If we go up now, it will be even worse!" Ian Moore looks at Bruce in disgust, then goes to the sofa and sits down. His short legs are shaking and look very smug.
	Duke looks at Bruce, who is drooping and frustrated, and smiles.
	The son of his brother is really interesting.
	After about an hour, Jamie comes down. She holds the waist with one hand by the wall. Her posture is strange.
	While walking, she is still talking about something. But those could not be good words.
	Bruce and Duke are shocked to see Jamie. Dan William is so cruel that she couldn't even walk well!
	Ian Moore's eyes are full of questions. Did Daddy really hit Mommy?
	Jamie goes downstairs under the intriguing eyes of Bruce and Duke, walking to the sofa and sitting down slowly. Her beautiful face is full of sweat, and her expression is distorted because of the pain.
	There is a problem.
	Bruce and Duke look at each other. They both understand each other.
	Jamie holds the corner of sofa. She grins in pain, and scolds in her heart. Damn it!
	At first, she thought that she would be beaten by Dan William again today. Who knows that beast man took her to the gym and let her run on the treadmill for a whole hour!!!
	An hour!
	There was a moment when she really thought she would die on the treadmill!
Chapter 116 Jozo’s Attack
	It's crueler than spanking her ass!
	After an hour, Jamie almost can't stand up straight. Her waist and legs are aching because she is so exhausted. Jamie wants to cry without tears. She doesn't want to be a mermaid, walking on the tip of a knife!
	Jamie doesn't find out that Bruce and Duke already think they have done something.
	If she knows, she will stand up and beat them in spite of her backache.
	Jamie leans on the sofa, even moving a finger making her feel to death, eyes are closed, a pair of tired miserable appearance.
	Ian Moore moves to Jamie's face and wrinkles his face. Daddy really abuses Mommy!
	"Mommy, I rub it for you." Ian Moore takes a sniff and decides not to talk with Dan William for a week.
	Jamie says yes slightly, and then Ian Moore kneads her legs, with moderate strength and comfortable pinching.
	Dan William changes his clothes and walks downstairs slowly, with his hands in his pockets, looking very relaxed.
	When seeing Dan William going downstairs, Bruce and Duke leave without saying a word. They are as smart as they choose not to mix in their business.
	Ian Moore rubs her very comfortably. Jamie leans her head against the sofa and sleeps on her arm.
	It can see how tired she is.
	"Baby, that's how your Mommy used to be care of you?" Dan William sees Ian Moore rubbing legs for Jamie, and glances at her who is still sleeping comfortably.
	Ian Moore is angry when he sees Dan. Naturally, he won't talk to him well. "I’d like."
	Dan William feels Ian Moore's displeasure. He knows that it's because of Jamie, this kid loves his mother very much. Dan William thinks he's a little jealous because he takes Jamie so seriously.
	So, the main reason for Ian Moore to accept him completely depends on Jamie.
	Dan’s eyes brightened, and he comes up to Ian Moore and said, "Baby is tired, let daddy do this."
	Ian Moore looks at him suspiciously, "You won't take the opportunity to bully Mommy again, will you?"
	"How can I abuse your mommy?" Dan William looks at him sincerely and thinks that Ian Moore is too clever to cheat.
	"Well." Ian Moore just moves away a little.
	Dan William sits down slightly, starting to rub legs for Jamie.
	Before that, he never rubs legs for anyone, and his strength is also controlled by his own feeling. However, he knows more about acupoints, and rubs them according to acupoints, which can also reduce tiredness.
	If he know punishes Jamie will make Ian Moore unhappy, he wouldn’t do this.
	"Daddy, don't be lazy. Keep rubbing." Ian Moore stares at Dan William and worries that he will abuse mummy again.
	It seems that the Dan William is the bad man.
	Jamie falls asleep, so she doesn’t see the beautiful screen of the family of three.
	Ian Moore stares the actions of Dan, if he slows down or makes a little effort, he will be disliked by Dan.
	Alma, who in a black suit, holds a stack of paper in her hand and has no expression on her cold face, walking around in the villa.
	The same special identity, but she and Night.7 is not the same type.
	Alma is cold and reserved, with a beautiful face. However, in her twenties, she has a mature behavior looks like she has been experienced by years. She likes to wear a pair of black, so she doesn’t look like the normal girls.
	Night.7 is charming, but careless and informal. The bright eyes are cold and can kill people inadvertently.
	It just doesn’t know whether such two different girls will become friends if they meet.
	Alma walks to the bedroom and knocks the door slightly. When listening a "come in" inside, she then goes in.
	Actually, when Dan William asks Alma to take care of Jozo, she is unwilling. However, she can’t disobey her master’s orders.
	What's more, this is a woman with different appearance.
	"Do you get the information I want?" Jozo sits in a wheelchair, with her back to Alma, and looks out of the window, but only one cold villa can be seen from the window.
	"Yes." Alma doesn't make any sound, and then hands the stack of paper to her.
	Jozo has been frightened by Alma for more than once, but she still hasn't been able to change Alma for so long.
	Jozo knows Alma still regard Dan William as her master.
	Jozo takes the paper, looking at the contents carefully. Every time she looks at it, her face becomes gloomy.
	Pa.
	Countless pieces of paper are thrown into the air, falling to the ground just like snow.
	Behind the flying paper, Jozo's beautiful face gradually becomes twisted, and she stares at the pile of materials with some resentment.
	One of them has a picture on it, just Jamie.
	Alma stands behind Jozo, her eyes drooping and hiding the madness under her eyes.
	Jamie’s all details are hidden by Dan, and no one is allowed to investigate. This is transferred from Derek.
	Not very detailed, but what should have are all on it.
	"Alma." Jozo slightly tilted her head and asks, "You have been with Dan William for so long. Do you know this Jamie?"
	"I don't know." Alma's eyes don’t lift, she says perfunctorily.
	"You don’t know? Can I think you're talking for that woman?" Jozo turns to the wheelchair and stares at Alma coldly.
	Those information are all details of life, but the most useful information Jozo gets is that Jamie is the daughter of Moore family and has an intimate relationship with Dan.
	Just of the word "Intimate relationship ", Jozo is very concerned.
	She squeezes her hands on both sides of the wheelchair, her eyes showing a sense of jealous.
	"You can think what you like." Alma says.
	"You!" Jozo stares at her eyes and looks angry, "Don't forget that Dan William has given you to me. Now I am your master! You'd better listen to me and do things for me, otherwise don't blame me for my punishment! "
	"Yes." Alma answers coldly and frowning. She doesn’t remember when Dan William gives her to Jozo.
	Jozo smiles with satisfaction. The more difficult she is to tame, the more she has the desire to conquer, such as Alma, such as Dan.
	"Good. Now take me to see that woman."
	Jozo wants to see how charm that woman is. Dan William wants to marry the woman, but the woman refused! She has worked for a long time to marry to Dan. It couldn’t fail!
	
Chapter 117 Jamie’s counterattack
	"Yes." Alma answers, and then turns around to leave to do her own things.
	At this time, Jamie is in the manor with a sketchbook to paint on it. She is bored very much.
	She wants to go to work, but Dan William is not allowed. Anyway, the attendance award is gone, so Jamie doesn’t care too much about working.
	She is sitting comfortably on a reclining chair with a sunshade near the pool.
	She draws on paper with a stock pencil in one hand, leaving only the sound
	of the tip of the pen rubbing against the paper all around.
	She has not felt such a leisurely afternoon for a long time. She is busy withher life in England, and don’t have her own time, not to mention that as leisurely as it is now.
	Jamie swings her arms and stretches her limbs. Her legs become numbed because of sitting for a long time.
	How comfortable it is!
	She shouts in her heart, and then squints her eyes like a cat.
	"Are you Jamie Moore?" she opens her eyes when she just closed her eyes to listen to the rustle of the breeze through the leave.
	She does not want to look for someone, but the one visits in person.
	Jamie looks at the girl in front of her, who is sitting on a wheelchair, with a
	lovely and sweet look. She is seemed to thinking, "who are you?"
	Jozo chuckles, "have you forgotten? It was on the phone that day."
	"Emm, I don't remember." Jamie looks at her blankly. She really has no impression of her.
	Jamie's eyes cross over the Jozo and then looks at Alma. Her eyes were slightly surprised. She had seen Alma.
	Alma is Dan's subordinate, but why is she following this woman?
	"Alma." Jamie greets at her.
	Alma nods, but her face is still glassy-eyed. Jamie knows that this is the kind performance of Alma. If change others, she will directly ignore it.
	Jozo is unpleasant with Jamie's disregard, but still has a sweet smile on her face. "Miss Moore and Alma are familiar. I wonder whether Jozo can also make a friend with Miss Moore?"
	"Jozo? I don't know anything about you." Jamie looks at her a little surprised. "And how do you get in here?"
	"Well, Dan William gives me a name card before, and if I need I can follow it to find him. I find here just want to try. Unexpectedly, I see Miss Moore." Jozo smiled shyly, as if she comes to give her lover a surprise, which was very pompous.
	Jamie's heart turns unpleasant, Dan? Calling so intimate! Then thought of the phone call that day, Jamie was a little displeasant, but she didn't show it on her face.
	Dan William never gives his name card to usual people, so who is the girl?
	"Well, but he's not here, or you can come another day." Jamie puts the sketchbook aside with an impeccable fake smile on her face.
	Obviously eviction!
	Jozo's face changes almost invisibly. Then she thought for a moment and said to Alma, "Alma, I'm thirsty. You're familiar with here. Can you bring me a glass of water?"
	It's kind and polite to ask questions. If someone else hears it, it's very kind-hearted to be such a kind host to a servant.
	"Yes." Alma answers and turns to pour water for her, even though she is not familiar with here.
	Jamie raises her eyebrows and knows that the Jozo is intended to get rid of Alma, but she doesn't know what she wants to do next.
	Jamie looks at her legs, raises her eyebrows and asks, "Your legs..."
	"Didn't Dan William tell Miss Moore?" Jozo looks shocked.
	Jamie shakes his head and feels a little depressed in the bottom of her heart, as if Danand Jozo have some secrets that she could not know. She is an outsider.
	Jozo shakes her wheelchair to get closer to Jamie, takes her hands and puts on her legs, with a slightly sweet expression. "My legs were hurt in order to save Dan, and I can't walk any more. Dan William has been very good to me these years, and finds the best medical team in the world, and even put Alma with me to take care of me..."
	Jozo's face is shy and sweet, like a woman falls in love.
	"I'm sorry I don't mean to say that. I just want to express my gratitude to Dan... " Jozo looks at Jamie in a panic as if suddenly woke up from a dream, and hurriedly explained.
	But Jamie feels a little pride and ostentation in her flustered eyes.
	Her lips twitch and she feels headache only. Why there are many people love Dan!!
	"It doesn't matter. I understand for it. It is insincere in verbal gratitude, or more reality?" Jamie lips raises with a sly charming delicate face.
	It has to be said that when Jozo sees Jamie's face, she feels definitely jealousy.
	"Sincerity? What does Miss Moore mean?" Jozo asked with a sweet smile and seems to keep her best condition, which is in sharp contrast to Jamie's casual look.
	"How do you want to express your gratitude? Marry him?" Jamie plays with the stock pencil, pretending to think.
	Jozo is happy on the surface, but she soon hides it, lowers her head and smiles shyly, "Jamie is really good at playing joke? Dan William and I are just ordinary friends..."
	Jamie's eyes are shining. Jozo is really a smart woman. It's better than Mia Moore and Emily Lin.
	Jamie sighs softly, and then smiles confidently. "Miss Jozo, I'm afraid that you've made a mistake."
	Jozo raises her head in amazement and looks at Jamie, who is naturally proud and boastful, which makes her feel extremely dazzling.
	Because that's one side she never shows in front of others.
	"What?"
	"First, I don't know whether Dan William loves you or not. Besides, he is my lover, how dare you to think about marrying him?"
	"Secondly, even if Dan William likes you, do you think he can marry you?" Jamie already sits up and leans slightly. Her eyes full of pride and self-confidence, which could not be ignored.
	Jamie's words pierced the heart of the Jozo.
	"Thirdly, it's useless for you to show off or have a row here, so don't waste time on me."
	Jozo's face is stiff. She doesn’t expect that Jamie would speak so directly.
	"Miss Moore, you misunderstand me. I don't mean to it." Comparing with Jamie's arrogant style, Jozo says softly as a little sheep, and as if a louder voice would scare her.
	"Ahuh? So what do you mean?" Jamie raises her eyebrows, as if she says, “If you don’t have any ideas, why you come to visit me.”
	Jozo suddenly changes to a pitiful expression and looks at Jamie. There are tears in her beautiful eyes. "I'm sorry, Miss Moore, I should not come here. It's all my fault. I don't mean to have a row. Don't be angry..."
	
Chapter 118 Misunderstand
	Jamie squints her eyes doubtfully. What the hell is all that about? Which eye does she look that she is angry?
	Saying it, Jozo seizes her arm, and then the whole person with the wheelchair falls to the side. Jamie is frightened, looking at Jozo. Jozo is painfully frowned, with cold sweat trickling down her face.
	Soon, Jamie knows why Jozo do it.
	A sound of tight footsteps comes this way. Jamie looks up, Dan William has been there. She just looks he bents down and hugs Jozo with the soft action. It is so harsh in Jamie's eyes.
	Dan William hugs Jozo. When passing her, he stops and looks Jamie. She can't understand his emotions through his eyes.
	Jamie's heart sinks down at once, muttering in frustration," It’s not me, she falls down herself."
	She explains, but it is hard to believe that. In Dan’s point of view, it is Jamie who pushes Jozo and caused jozo to fall.
	"Dan, I'm in such a great pain, can you take me to the hospital?" Jozo seizes Dan's clothes. Her face is pale, looking very weak.
	Without hesitation, Dan William holds Jozo and quickly leaves.
	Jamie just feels like she is poured down a large basin of ice water, which makes her feel cold.
	His attitude is obvious. He doesn't believe her.
	Jamie keeps her head down and bits her lip. The black hair looks incredibly soft, reflecting a dazzling cold light in the sunlight.
	Until dusk, Dan William doesn't go back home.
	Jamie doesn't have mood and appetite to eat dinner. She stays in Ian Moore's bedroom and plays with computers.
	“Mom...you have been playing computer for two hours, please let me play.” Ian Moore sees Jamie staying in his room after dinner for a long time and taking over his computer.
	What even scared is that she would comment in every message, "Wish lovers in the world say goodbye."
	Cruel, it's too cruel.
	Ian Moore swallows his saliva, and dares not to interrupt her when she looks so horrible, but she keeps playing crazily. Ian Moore is worried about whether his keyboard will run out like this.
	Jamie finally stops the right hand of pressing the mouse. Because her fingers are a little stiff for playing such a long time, so she stretches them uncomfortably.
	"Ian Moore, you are not kind because you want to get the computer from your mommy." With saying that, Jamie stands up and walks towards Ian Moore's soft children bed. And then she lies down.
	Ian Moore is speechless and quickly jumps to the chair. He takes a silent look at Jamie who has already pulled the quilt, and asks doubtfully, "Is Mommy going to sleep with the baby tonight?"
	"Emm, mummy is here tonight.” Jamie looks at the ceiling, covered her face with the quilt, and there is a faint smell of milk around her.
	Mommy is strange tonight. Ian Moore blinks his eyes. Does she quarrel with daddy?
	Ian Moore doesn't care about his game either. He turns off the computer and goes to the bedside. He opens one side of the quilt and takes off his shoes and sleeps in.
	"Mummy, are you unhappy?" Ian Moore turns to look at Jamie. What a cute baby. He intends to change Jamie's mood.
	Jamie continues to snort, then turns and pinches Ian Moore's soft face. "It's not so good."
	"It's good to look at the baby." Ian Moore points to his face.
	"Why?"
	"Because your baby is handsome."
	"hha."
	Jamie couldn't help laughing. She scrapes Ian Moore's nose with her index finger. "Who teach you to be so narcissistic? How many girls will fall in love with you when you grow up? "
	"Of course, I learn from you. Don’t you often look in the mirror and say, ‘Oh, who is so beautiful? I am fascinated by the people in the mirror.’” Ian Moore imitates Jamie, and reappears the scene in a similar way.
	Jamie chokes and a little embarrassed is on her face, and finally hugs Ian Moore's little head.
	“Sleep, stay up late you'll be stupid.”
	Ian Moore chuckles, when hears that staying up late would be stupid, he immediately closes his eyes and urges he to fall asleep.
	...
	After the doctor's examination, Jozo sits on the bed with a pale face. Her beautiful eyes flash uneasy lights. She looks at the door. The doctor seems to explain Alma something, and then leaves.
	Looking at the man standing in front of the window with his hands in his pockets, the light moon shines on him, with a cool temperament. Jozo's beautiful eyes are full of pride.
	She thinks that how important Jamie is to him. It turned out that she's just an unimportant person.
	"Dan..." Jozo calls him softly and sweetly. Seeing Dan William turns around and looks over, she raises a strong smile. "I'm fine. I fall down accidentally today. It's no fault for Miss Moore..."
	Dan William frowns. His eyes full of worry. When he hears what she says, he nods, "I know it's not her."
	Jamie is not the kind of person who will take advantage of others in danger. She is lazy and doesn't have the leisure to push Jozo to wrestle.
	Jozo feels astonished. He doesn't misunderstand Jamie ?
	"That's well, so I can rest assured." Jozo smiles with relief and shows a kind and beautiful appearance.
	Dan William nods slightly, as if thinking of something. He suddenly asks, "how are you going there today?"
	He don't tell Jozo where he lives, it's only Alma knows these things.
	"Don't you want me to go?" Jozo blinks innocently, sounding a little aggrieved.
	"No, your legs are hurt. Don't run around." Dan William smiles at her with relief. "Don't go there if you have nothing. I will spare time to accompany you."
	Out of guilty, Dan William don't tell Jozo directly that she would never go there again to avoid provoking Jamie.
	"Okay, I'll listen to you." Jozo smiles. She would never show her grievance in front of Dan. That's her cleverness.
	"Oh, Dan, don't you really think about my last wish?" Jozo says softly, with her hands on her legs, "I'm afraid my leg will never get better."
	He looks at Jozo for a few seconds and then looks away. "Jozo, I can satisfy any wish you want, but I can't do this."
	"Why?" Being rejected again, Jozo's eyes are full of injured looks. She loves Dan William. She couldn't believe that he doesn't know!
	"Don't worry, I will cure you until the day you can walk." Dan William says so calm that make people feel this person has no feelings.
	
Chapter 119 Escape? It’s impossible!
	There is no doubt that Jozo is very beautiful. Ordinary people will be surprised when they hear Dan William’s words, since Dan William says such words to Jozo. But as for Dan William who sees many kinds of beauties from childhood, it’s nothing.
	But if he has to bear a special responsibility on this woman, thing would be changed.
	It’s him that make a woman can’t walk for the rest of her life. Dan William feels guilty, but this does not mean that he will marry her.
	"Am I not good enough? You say it, and I'll change now!" Jozo looks at him with poor eyes and her eyes are full of expectation.
	"No, you're fine, but I'm not the right man for you." Dan William sits down and looks at her.
	“You don't want to marry me. Is the fact that you love other woman in your heart?" Jozo says in a gentle way. She doesn’t cry and she doesn’t show any unhappy. This is why Dan William can tolerate her more than others.
	Seeing Dan William doesn’t say anything, she says, “Is that woman Jamie Moore?”
	"Yes." Dan William doesn’t want to give any hope to Jozo, thus he nods.
	Jozo smiles sadly, and she holds her hand tightly. The fingernail stabs into the palm of the hand, but Jozo doesn't realize it.
	"You should have a good rest. I'll go first." Dan William looks at the time. It's eleven o'clock. Jamie Moore and Ian Moore are still waiting for him at home.
	Thinking of here, Dan William feels very warm. He wants to go back to home quickly.
	Although Jozo doesn’t want to agree it, she also knows that Dan William doesn’t want to stay with other woman, thus she nods, "Be careful on the road."
	Hearing the sound of the engine coming through the window, the soft smile on Jozo's face disappears gradually.
	She picks up a water glass on the table and smashes it to the ground.
	The cup falls to the ground and then breaks into the piece.
	It seems that this is not enough to relieve her anger. She throws all the things she could catch to the ground. She won't give up until she can't catch anything again.
	She slaps the bed angrily. She looks at the immovable legs of her, and her eyes full of resentment.
	Now she can’t walk. Why does he still refuse to marry her?
	Alma walks into the room, and then she sweeps away the debris and rubbish on the ground silently, and then she leaves quietly.
	She has been used to this situation. Jozo is moody. As long as she is in a bad mood, everything in the room will be smashed. Fortunately, she is not in a wheelchair, otherwise the room will suffer difficulties.
	"Jamie Moore, well" Only she could get the position of Mr. William!
	Dan William parks the car well, and then he gets off the car.
	At this time, the lights in the manor have gradually dimmed, and the lights in the villa have all gone out. It's time to go to bed.
	It’s very quiet in the whole manor, and one could only hear the sound of the sea.
	He opens the door and walks into the villa. He opens the lights to change his shoes, and then goes went upstairs.
	He walks to the room and then enters the room. He opens the light, and then the whole room suddenly becomes bright.
	Dan William looks around, but he doesn’t see Jamie Moore. He looks at the bathroom, which is also empty.
	He looks all over the room, but he still doesn't see Jamie Moore.
	Dan William throws the suit coat on the sofa, and then he comes to Ian Moore's room, and then he pushes the door gently.
	He doesn’t open the lamp, because he is afraid that he will wake Ian Moore up. He looks at the bed of Ian Moore with the moonlight, and then he finds there are two people lies on the bed. One figure is small and one figure is large.
	He walks close to the room and then he finds that it’s Jamie Moore who is sleeping sweetly there.
	Ha. Dan William chuckles, and then he walks to the other side. He gently lifts the quilt over Jamie Moore, and hugs Jamie Moore in his arm.
	As soon as Jamie Moore leaves, the position on the bed is obviously bigger. Ian Moore is still sleeping, and he rolls to the center of the bed. He presses his lips and he looks very smart.
	Dan William covers the quilt for Ian Moore well, and then he kisses Ian Moore’s forehead, and says goodnight to Ian Moore.
	Dan William throws Jamie Moore on the bed as soon as they come back to their room. Fortunately, the bed is soft enough, and Jamie Moore doesn’t wake up, and she turns over and continues to sleep.
	Dan William thinks Jamie Moore will wake up, but she doesn’t, thus Dan William’s face become dark. He looks at the delicate sleeping face of Jamie Moore, but he doesn’t do anything after thinking for a while.
	He is ready to stand up to take a shower. But his hands slips, and then his whole body fall on the body of Jamie Moore.
	Anyone will be wake up after suffering such thing. Thus Jamie Moore wakes up.
	"The ghost presses the bed?" Jamie Moore says in a laborious way. She looks at the man on her body, and her eyes are still bleary, and she could not see his face clearly.
	"Who is ghost?" Dan William stares at her, and then lifts himself up with his hands. Who knows what's wrong with the bed today? He falls down again.
	"Ghost!" Jamie Moore feels very uncomfortable, and she feels pain on her chest, thus she coughs for a few times.
	"Don’t shut!" Dan William finally stands up, and he glares at her.
	Jamie Moore immediately shuts up. When she finds that it’s Dan William who presses her, she signs. But then she finds the posture is wrong. What does he want to do?
	At this time, Dan William leans over Jamie Moore with an ambiguous posture. Anyone will think more when they see this.
	Jamie Moore looks at him in horror. She puts her hand in the front of Jamie Moore, and then she says, "What do you want to do? Hooligan? I tell you that it’s not easy to bully me!"
	Originally, Jamie Moore wants to leave, but he changes his decision after hearing Jamie Moore’s words. He looks at Jamie Moore. At such a close distance, he could see the reflection of Jamie Moore, "Hooligan? Are you sure?"
	He moves close to Jamie Moore as he says. Thus Jamie Moore’s face become red, and now she looks very attractive.
	"If you dare to do something bad to me, believe it or not, I'll leave with my son tomorrow." Jamie Moore stares at him, and her face is very red.
	But she still scolds herself in her heart. How could she be so bad in front of Dan William.
	"Leave? No way!" Dan William bows his head, and he is very close to Jamie Moore now. It seems that he could kiss Jamie Moore if he wants.
	"Get up!" Jamie Moore is a little afraid, and she constantly twists her body like a little fish. She wants to stay away with Dan William right now.
	This guy is so heavy!
	Jamie Moore rolls eyes and she tries all her effort to struggle.
	Dan William’s eyes become dark as Jamie Moore struggles. It seems that his eyes are full of fire, and his voice also changes, “If you continue to struggle, I will do something to you now.”
	Jamie Moore’s face becomes redder as she hears Dan William’s words. She is not an idiot. She could obviously feel that there is something on her legs.
	Jamie Moore stares at him angrily, but she dares not to move anymore, "Hooligan! Stand up!"
	Dan William's eyes become dark, and his eyes are also full of smile. He quickly kisses Jamie Moore, and then he gets up and goes to the bathroom. "This time, I will let you go first..."
	Jamie Moore sits up immediately, and then she wipes her red face. She stares at the figure entering the bathroom. "If you dare to kiss me next time, I will bite you!"
	
Chapter 120 Go to work
	Then she pulls the quilts and goes to sleep!
	Dan William, who stays in the bathroom, feels very uncomfortable. The night of the manor is cold. He has to take a shower with cold water to relieve the heat.
	After taking shower with cold water for a long time, he is not very hot now. He opens his eye, and the water slides down the outline of Dan's face and then falls on his chest.
	He never thinks that he has such a desire toward Jamie Moore. He even can’t bear such a small touch.
	He should take this smart cat back to home immediately.
	Jamie Moore has fallen asleep when Dan William walks out. It seems that she is very afraid of Dan William’s action, so she covers her face at this time, and we could only see her head.
	He couldn't help laughing. Is he so bad in her heart?
	What’s more, if she is not willing to do this, he will never force her.
	But she should pay the interest, and she has to pay it back.
	The next day, when Jamie Moore wakes up, the quilt on her body is gone. She sits up quickly and tries to pull the quilt underground subconsciously. As expected, she holds the quilt immediately.
	Then she falls on the bed again, and continues to sleep.
	But how can she keep sleeping after waking up? Thus Jamie Moore opens her eyes after closing the eyes for a while.
	Since she can’t fall asleep, she sits up immediately. But she finds her lips have been beaten by something. She feels pain, and the skin around her neck is not very comfortable.
	Have I meet a ghost? She mumbles and then she walks to the bathroom to take a shower.
	"Ah!" When she sees herself in the mirror, she exclaims. She finds not only her lips are bad, but also there are a few red strawberries on her neck and clavicle. Even if she is an idiot, she would know what happens!
	Dan William!
	Jamie Moore’s eyes are full of fire. How could he do such thing to her when she is in sleep!
	Thus Jamie Moore has to wear a dress with a higher collar. Her long hair also could block it.
	She goes downstairs and comes to the restaurant. Dan William and Ian Moore are sitting there for breakfast. When Ian Moore sees Jamie Moore goes down, he waves to her.
	"Good morning, Mommy."
	"Good morning baby." Jamie Moore stares at Dan William. She even wants to beat Dan William, and then she sits in her own position.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore and then he smiles.
	"Mommy and daddy. Why don’t you kiss each other in the morning?" Ian Moore looks at Dan William and Jamie Moore with wide eyes, and he is puzzled about this.
	Jamie Moore holds the milk in her hand. She reminds the thing happens yesterday and the thing she sees in the morning, and she feels very bad.
	"You should just eat your food. Stopping talking.” Then she puts small bread into Ian Moore’s mouth.
	Ian Moore wrinkles his face. Mommy is so stupid. He just wants to promote the feeling between his mommy and daddy!
	"But the TV also shows this. Am I right? Daddy." Ian Moore looks at Dan William and blinks.
	Dan William smiles, “Yeah. Baby, you are right.”
	Watching TV is so harmful. Jamie Moore murmurs. Last night, Dan William does such bad things to her. Morning kiss? No way.
	"Mommy?" Ian Moore looks at Jamie Moore pitifully.
	Jamie Moore smiles suddenly. Seeing this, Ian Moore is afraid, “Baby, what games are you playing recently, eh?"
	Ian Moore shivers, and he knows something bad will happened. “Mommy, baby hasn't been playing games lately...Oh, it's time for class. Baby is going to school."
	"Wait a minute, what are you doing in such a hurry? Mommy wants to talk to you more."
	"I have no time to talk with you, and I am going to class." Ian Moore holds the milk and then he walks to the outside. "Goodbye Daddy!"
	And then he runs away quickly. He is afraid that Jamie Moore will catch him.
	This is right. Ian Moore likes the computer Dan William sent him most. As Jamie Moore says, it's clearly that Jamie Moore has idea on his computer. Can’t he be in a hurry?
	Seeing that Ian Moore only says goodbye to Dan William, Jamie Moore feels very uncomfortable, thus she hums.
	"When can I go to work?" Jamie Moore turns to look at Dan William who is in a good mood, and she feels more uncomfortable.
	She picks the fork up and pokes at the bow. Do you feel proud when our son says goodbye to you? Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke!
	Dan William wipes his lips with a tissue. He thinks for a while and then says, “Do you want to go to walk?”
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become bright, and then she nods heavily.
	Jamie Moore feels very happy when she returns back to the office. In recent days, she feels very boring since she stays in the manor alone.
	If a person lives his life in a comfortable way, he will become a salted fish.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t forget that she has a mission.
	If she knows that Ian Moore has finished the task, she might really doubt the world.
	The office is very empty. Jamie Moore doesn’t find Nana Banks and Adam Lee in the office, thus she is confused. And then she sees Secretary Sam walks in the office.
	"Miss Jamie." Secretary Sam smiles at Jamie Moore.
	"What’s the matter?"
	Nana Banks and Adam Lee go back to their hometown to get married not long ago. I believe Miss Moore should know the situation of Emily Lin, so now only Miss Moore leaves in the office." Secretary Sam says slowly.
	Does Nana Banks and Adam Lee fall in love with each other? Jamie Moore is surprised. What’s more, they are childhood sweethearts. It’s so well they get married so quickly.
	She even has a child with Dan William. But let alone get married, there is no sign of marriage.
	"At the last nomination meeting, Miss Moore is the No.1, so the president decides to let Miss Moore act as the chief designer of Cr."
	Chief designer? Jamie Moore is slightly surprised. "I just come here. I don't know much about Cr. how I can act as..."
	"Miss Moore, you should accept it. The president will not give up his decision. What’s more, Jamie Moore has such ability.” it should be said that Secretary Sam admires Jamie Moore’s ability. She is young, but she has talent, and she gains a reputation that others can’t get in a short time.
	If Dan William is a myth that has caused a stir in the whole country C, then Jamie Moore is a myth that has caused a stir in the whole fashion industry.
	Jamie Moore keeps silent. Because in such way, she will meet Dan William more time than before. Instead, she will meet Dan William every day.
	If she knows, she will stay at the manor. Thus she will not meet Dan William every day.
	"The president also says that the salary is twice as much as before." Secretary Sam reminds the last words Dan William says.
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become bright. Twice, twice!
	It seems that there is countless money with fleshy wings flying towards her.
	Dan William knows Jamie Moore can’t reject this, thus he is so confident.
	At the same time, Dan William sits at the desk, and he is drinking coffee. He looks at the handsome face with blue pupils on the screen.
	
Chapter 121 I am your child's father
	"If it's not for the sake of Jamie Moore, I'll kill you right now." Katt John could speak the language of Country C so well, which surprises Dan William.
	But Katt John is very proud of this, and his eyes are full of sneers, “Hello, brother, are you surprised? Jamie Moore has taught me the language of Country C. I am so lucky. I meet the most beautiful goddess in my life!"
	Dan William is very angry, and the coffee cup in his hand shivers, and some coffee is sprinkled on his hand. He puts the coffee cup aside, and then he takes a few tissues to wipe the stains on his hands, and then he accurately throws them into the garbage basket beside the table.
	"I never expect that she lives such a bad life after leaving FS. You are such a mean boss, and Jamie Moore is so pitiful.” Katt John says, and he doesn’t find the darkness of Dan William’s face.
	Mean?
	If he is so mean, he should not receive the call from him.
	Dan William feels that the most regretful thing he did today is to click the accept button.
	He doesn't have much interaction with Katt John, but today Katt John finds him actively. He sends a video call to him. He doesn't know why he accepts the call, so this scene appeared.
	How many men did that woman provoke in foreign countries?
	Dan William’s face become dark, thus he presses his lips. He looks at Katt John, and says, “Katt John, don’t you know Jamie Moore has a child?”
	"Of course I know! But that doesn't stop me from pursuing her!" Katt John says firmly.
	Dan William forgets that foreigners are still very open.
	"You should know that I almost tie her up when I hear Jamie Moore wants to leave. I never expect that Jamie Moore comes to your company. It’s really hurt me!” Katt John lies on the chair with an unacceptable expression, covering his chest.
	It's amazing that Jamie Moore will love you!
	What’s more, when Dan William hears Katt John wants to tie Jamie Moore up when Jamie Moore wants to leave, he holds the pen on his hands tightly.
	"Mr. Katt, you don't know the father of Jamie Moore's son, do you?" Dan William says.
	Katt John shakes his head, “But I have seen child, and that child is the cutest and smartest of all the kids I've ever seen! If little Jamie Moore wants to do this, I can have one with her!"
	You are making dream!
	Dann William’s face become dark and the expression on his face become soft when he reminds the words he is ready to say, “The father of that child is me.”
	Katt John’s face becomes dark after hearing this, and then the air suddenly become silent.
	When Dan William wants to turn off the computer, he sees an eye appear on the screen. And the eye stares at him as if he wants to confirm something.
	This picture is so funny. But Dan William is really indifferent to the leader of FS after today.
	"What did you say? Are you the father of the child?" Katt John is so surprised and he sits on the sofa sadly.
	Maybe he shouldn't receive the video call. At least, there's hope in his heart.
	"No, since you are the father of the child, why do you abandon Jamie Moore and the child in England?" Katt John believes Dan William, but he still despises it.
	Abandon?
	Dan William's eyes flashes slightly. This is the third time for him to hear these words, "I don’t know all the things in advance."
	Katt John sneers after hearing the explanation of Dan William, “Do you think I'm a fool or stupid? Don’t you know your woman has your children?"
	Katt John says in the language of Country C and English. All of this show that how excited he is.
	"You are the kind of man that your country often says. What’s that words...You will never know how bad Jamie Moore lives before she comes to FS. Who are you? Katt John is so angry, thus he says in an incoherent way.
	Who are you? Maybe he refers to a bad man...
	Dan William's eyes are full of storm. He is very unhappy with the accusation of that person. He has no ability to accuse him.
	"Let’s end the conversation today, Mr. Katt. Goodbye." Dan William sneers, and then he turns off the call, and the screen goes black immediately.
	“...” Katt John is very sad, and he still wants to talk with him. He even doesn’t see Jamie Moore!
	Dan William throws the pen on the table, and then he frowns, and his eyes are full of anger.
	Click click click.
	"Come in." he says in a deep voice. Then Secretary Sam walks in with Jamie Moore, "President, the promotion of Jamie Moore is ready. What else can I do for you?"
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore who stands silently beside Secretary Sam, “No. Please take her to her office."
	"Yes." Secretary Sam prepares to take Jamie Moore leave.
	"Wait." Dan William stops suddenly. "You go out, and she stays here."
	Jamie Moore looks at Dan William. She is sure that Dan William refers to her.
	Secretary Sam walks out, and then she closes the door.
	"Mr. Dan, what can I do for you?" Jamie Moore puts down his displeasure. Then she smiles at Dan William and asks politely.
	"Katt John just sends me a video call." Dan William says and he stares at Jamie Moore.
	Katt John? Jamie Moore is surprised. How could he call Dan William?
	Jamie Moore is a little afraid when she reminds of Katt John. It's not because of how terrible Katt John is, but because Katt John's pursuit are really terrible. He can appear in front of her at any time and place, and the things he delivers will not be repeated every time.
	If it’s not Jamie Moore, but other woman, she must be happy to scream and accept him without reservation.
	But Jamie Moore is very angry about this.
	She even takes Ian Moore to persuade Katt John, but Katt John doesn’t give up. Instead, he pursues her in a hard way.
	Half of her and Ian Moore's nests are full of the things sent by Katt John.
	When she refuses to receive Katt John’s gifts, he will appear in front of her at any time. He is so sticky.
	What’s more, this person is the top leader of FS. He is the boss...
	Jamie Moore has a headache when he hears the name of Katt John.
	“Why does he give a call to you?”
	Dan William notices the changing face of Jamie Moore, and then he says, “He wants to know the thing happened to you.”
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. It’s not narcissism.
	"Have you told him?" Jamie Moore leans against Dan William. She always feels that he is not a so kind-hearted person, and there must be a plot.
	"Yes." Dan William presses his lips and then he says, "I told him that I am your child's father."
	He looks very confident. It seems that Katt John will be the loser.
Chapter 122 Cooperation
	"Oh, that would kill him." Jamie Moore is afraid when she thinks about it. She doesn’t forget that when she hands in her resignation, Katt John wants to tie her up with a rope.
	He doesn’t like a leader of a company.
	Some people are only suitable to be brothers, but not suitable to be lovers.
	Dan William’s eyes become bright, and the anger in his heart disappeared.
	"Do you remember what day it will be three days later?" Dan William puts his hand on the table. He is in a lazy way, which is very attractive.
	Three days later?
	Jamie Moore calculates quickly in her mind. It’s neither a festival nor an important day.
	But since Dan William asks her, it means that day is very important.
	"What day is that day?" Jamie Moore asks, and then she sees Dan William’s face become dark, thus her heart jumps heavily.
	"Have you forgotten it?" Dan William narrows his black eyes, and he looks at Jamie Moore with a dangerous look. He is just like a cheetah, which is full of a terrible smell all over his body.
	It seems that as soon as she nods, he will tear her up.
	"I never forget it. How can I forget it?" Jamie Moore waves her hands and shakes her head quickly. "It's your birthday three days later."
	She rolls her eyes in her heart. How can she forget his birthday?
	"Yeah." Dan William's face finally eases down. He snorts and looks at her irrefutably.
	"Don't worry and I'll give you the gift soon!" Jamie Moore nods in a determined manner. He couldn't stand the eyesight of Dan William, as if he is going to eat her.
	She knows that if he dissatisfy with the gift, he might kill her.
	“If you tie yourself with a bow and send it to me, maybe I will accept it." Dan William says with a smile. It seems that he could see through other people’s heart with his eyes.
	Tie her with a bow and send her to him?
	Accept reluctantly?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she puts hair on her shoulder to behind. She looks at Dan William with a smile, “Has Mr. Dan been empty and lonely recently? There are only impure things in your mind."
	"You're the only one in my mind." Dan William is really a fox. Jamie Moore feels embarrassed after hearing Dan William’s word.
	"Believe it or not, I will castrate you if you dare to do something bad on me again?" Jamie Moore slaps on the table. It seems that Jamie Moore is get up on her legs, but she feels very pain in her heart.
	Mr. William looks at her innocently, and then he says, "Jamie Moore, when did I do something bad to you? I am a gentleman. "
	You are a villain!
	"Did you do something bad to me while I was sleeping last night? I know all the things!" Jamie Moore is very angry. Although he used to be a liar, now his lie skills are better than before!
	Jamie Moore pulls downs the collar as she says. Although the red mark has faded a little, one still can see the red mark clearly.
	Dan William smiles and then he looks at the white skin of her and says, "What's the matter? Are you shy?"
	"Shy? It’s impossible!" Jamie Moore scolds hardly, and then she walks out angrily
	She could hear the smiling sound of Dan William before she closes the door. She feels very sad.
	As soon as Jamie Moore walks out of the office, she sees Ryan Jack. She is surprised about this. How could Ryan Jack appear in the CR building at this time?
	"Jamie Moore." Ryan Jack is also surprised. The smile on his face is very warm, which just like the sun. He walks to her slowly. "Do you work here?"
	"Yes, I'm a designer here. How about you?" Jamie Moore replies with a smile.
	Ryan Jack looks very warm, which could calm other people down quickly.
	Suddenly, Jamie Moore reminds Hooson. Although she is not familiar with Hooson, his smile is also very warm, which is the same as Ryan Jack.
	It seems that she hasn't seen him for a long time.
	It's not that Jamie Moore misses him. It's that he hasn't seen him since she meets him last hospital. She is a little strange about this.
	"Our company and your company have cooperation, and we discuss the thing here. Maybe we will work together on a project maybe." Ryan Jack says with a smile.
	"Well, I'm looking forward to working with you." Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and then she says.
	After chatting for a while, Secretary Sam leads Ryan Jack into the reception room, and Jamie Moore goes into the office next to the president's office.
	An hour later, Jamie Moore receives the message sent by Ryan Jack, which clearly states that Company Moon has recently launched a perfume, which is specially designed for women in C country. The Company Moon has already decided to cooperate with CR. The model is the famous model July Summer, but we still need a few suits. It’s Jamie Moore who should be responsible for the cloth. The theme should be suit for novelty. And the message also says that he is glad to cooperate with her, etc.
	"It seems that you have already known it." The voice of Dan William suddenly appeared in Jamie Moore's office. He says in an unhappy way.
	Jamie Moore turns off the cell phone subconsciously. She looks up and then she sees Dan William leans against the table. He takes off his suit coat, and he only wears white shirt. The first and second buttons are untied at will. His long straight legs are wrapped in black trousers. He looks very attractive, which make people unable to move their eyes.
	Seeing Jamie Moore’s action, Dan William’s eyesight become dark, and then he looks at her quietly.
	"I see." Jamie Moore nods.
	Dan William looks at her for a long time, and then he presses his lips and says, “Yes.”
	Jamie Moore looks at Dan William who leaves through the door of the president’s office and her office. She is a little confused.
	What does this man think?
	To tell you the truth, Jamie Moore doesn’t know Dan William’s mind most of the time. He always thinks thing too deep, thus no one know his thinking.
	It seems that no one know his thinking.
	The cooperation soon starts, and Jamie Moore also goes to Company Moon because of this cooperation.
	Although the perfume introduced by Company Moon has not been exposed yet, as a leading female perfume company, new products produced by Company Moon will be sold out immediately.
	If the cloth of Cr is a dream that women pursues, and then the perfume of Company Moon carries all the women's fanatical expectations.
	The perfume of Company Moon has never invited anyone as their spokesman. Thus all people will know this perfume at this time.
	Jamie Moore knows Hooson is working in this company. Except this, she doesn’t know anything.
Chapter 123 Enchanting
	"Jamie Moore, here you are." Ryan Jack waits at the front gate of the building. He waves to Jamie Moore as soon as he sees Jamie Moore, “Let's go, and I will take you to see our perfume first."
	"OK, but I don't know that you even know perfume." Jamie Moore walks into the building with Ryan Jack as she says.
	Ryan Jack is an interior designer when he is in the UK. He founded a company with his friends. He has a small reputation in the UK.
	But Jamie Moore has made friend with him for a few years and she doesn't know that he is interested in perfume.
	The complex color flashes in Ryan Jack’s eyes, and then disappears. He takes Jamie Moore into the lift, and then he continues to explain, "I only know a little bit. If you want any perfume, you could find me.”
	"Thank you, but I don't love the smell of perfume, so I don’t need any perfume."
	Ryan Jack knows that Jamie Moore really has no interest in the smell of perfume.
	"It’s not right. I know there's a perfume that suits you." Ryan Jack remembers a perfume introduced by Moon. He smiles, and then he takes Jamie Moore to his office.
	His office is just like himself, which is very warm. The light is very good. The sunshine shining from outside and it's golden.
	There are also some green potted plants on that desk. Some of them are lovely succulent plants. At the top, there are some light pink plants. The leaves of the succulent plants are lovely.
	Jamie Moore walks forward and then she touches the leaves with her hand. The fleshy ones look lovely. Some of them look like cat's claws, and there are some thin soft fluffs on them.
	"Jamie Moore, come here." Ryan Jack says. He walks to the yellow sofa, and then he puts a box on the glass table in front of her. Then he calls Jamie Moore.
	"What is this?" Jamie Moore sits down. She looks at the black elegant box. Her eyes are full of curiosity. There is English letters-CX on it. She thinks it’s should be perfume which will be in the market.
	Ryan Jack opens the box and then he pushes the box toward Jamie Moore.
	There are three crystal clear glass bottles in it. The first one is mint green, and the second one is peach pink, and the third one is lemon yellow.
	"This is the upcoming series of perfume. A set involves three bottles. The name of perfume is enchanting, which means enchanting." Ryan Jack introduces these perfumes with pride voice, “Every bottle smells different. If you smell it alone, you will feel good, but it doesn't work and you need to use it before you know it."
	Then Ryan Jack picks the bottle of mint green up as he says, and then he sprays some of perfume on Jamie Moore’s hand.
	Jamie Moore smells, and she finds the fragrance of the perfume is light, which is full of minty. But if you smell clearly, you could find the smell of jasmine. The two smells are well blended, but the smell is prolonged. Even Jamie Moore, who hates perfume, will not hate this smell.
	When you put some perfume on your body, you will feel could in the place that perfume touches, which is very comfortable.
	She looks at those bottles of perfume. From the package of the perfume, the design is unique and novel. From the perfume itself, the fragrance is very light. But if you smell it for long time, the perfume will exude a kind of enchanting breath.
	It's a perfect match for the name of this perfume.
	Enchanting, enchanting.
	"How do you feel? Do you feel sick when you smell it?” Ryan Jack looks Jamie Moore nervously. If she still feels sick when she smells the fragrance of this perfume, it would be a failure.
	However, if you want to make a perfume which is suitable for women in C countries, you will undoubtedly see the best result in Jamie Moore's body.
	"No, it smells good." Jamie Moore says with a smile.
	Ryan Jack relieves. Then he looks at Jamie Moore happily as if a child who gets candies, "I'll give you a suit after the perfume is on the market."
	"No, this perfume should be very expansive. Besides, you're such a loser. Does your father know it?” Jamie Moore shakes her head and refuses. Although the perfume smells good, she doesn't want Ryan Jack to pay for it, and she doesn't love perfume.
	"Never mind," Our boss says it's an extra thank gift." Ryan Jack blinks, and Jamie Moore can’t refuse his words.
	If she still refuses it, she will be an idiot.
	Even though she doesn’t use it, she can send it to others.
	"Well, thank you. I will draw the design draft out as soon as possible. You will be satisfied about it." Jamie Moore stands up. Time is up, she needs to leave now.
	This is the first time for her to design clothes for perfume. To be honest, Jamie Moore is expected about this.
	"Wait." Ryan Jack calls her in a hurry way. He says when he sees Jamie Moore turns back, "I'll take you to watch our perfume research and development room, and maybe you will have more inspiration after seeing it."
	Jamie Moore nods with a smile, “OK.”
	But Miss Moore has her own idea in her mind. She has never visited such a place before. This time, she must take good advantage to look at it.
	...
	In the manor, Dan William sits on the sofa. The TV shows is related to financial. Ian Moore eats fruit besides Dan William. He blinks and looks at the time.
	It's almost ten o'clock. Mommy hasn't come back yet. Daddy's face is terrible.
	Ian Moore thinks as he eats the watermelon in his hand. He is in a god mood.
	Dan William is dressed in light colored household clothes. He is not in a good mood. He stares at the TV screen, but his mind has gone.
	Damn, he shouldn't let that woman take charge of the design of Moon. It's ten o'clock and she hasn't come back yet. Even if they want to talk about life, they should finish it.
	Dan William knows the relationship between Ryan Jack and Jamie Moore, and he also knows Ryan Jack loves Jamie Moore, but he still lets Jamie Moore be responsible for their perfume clothes.
	Maybe he is too confident to himself, or he looks down Ryan Jack.
	He scolds, and his eyes are mixed with a sense of despondency.
	"Miss Moore is back." Cindy Swift walks to the door. She takes the things in Jamie Moore’s hand, and she greets Jamie Moore into the room with a smile.
	"Well." Jamie Moore pretends that she is fine, and she smiles at Cindy Swift. When she walks into the room, she sees Dan William and Ian Moore sit on the sofa.
	Suddenly she feels very soft in her heart.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore out of the corner of his eyes. He doesn’t change his expression, and then he asks in a cold voice, “Are you back?”
	"Yes." Jamie Moore sits on the sofa. "Baby."
	"Welcome to our home, Mommy." Ian Moore abandons Dan William as soon as Jamie Moore comes back, and then he runs to Jamie Moore.
	Dan William is not very happy, but all of this is for Jamie Moore.
	"Why? Mommy, how do you get pimples on your face?" Ian Moore looks at the goose pimples on Jamie Moore’s face in a surprised way. He looks at the hand of Jamie Moore, and then he finds there are also goose pimples on Jamie Moore’s hand!
Chapter 124 Being allergic
	"Yes, I feel itchy and uncomfortable just now." Jamie scratches her arm with her fingers. She doesn't know what happens. She just goes to the perfume R&D laboratory and it turns out to that when she comes back.
	It seems that she can't use perfume with her physical nature.
	But the three bottles of perfume that Ryan tries for her don't make her a little uncomfortable. Is she still allergic to the types of perfume?
	Jamie has always known that she will feel disgusting when she smells perfume. But she doesn't know that she is still allergic to perfume!
	"What's the matter?" Dan walks over to sit beside her, pulling her arm to look at the red dot on it. His eyes become serious slightly, "Cindy, call Jim to come here."
	"You can't scratch it again. It will hurt more badly if you scratch your skin again." Dan frowns, preventing Jamie from scratching her arm, neck and face. His voice is a little serious.
	The fair skin on her face and neck is scratched by herself accompanying with many red marks. It must rotten if she continues to scratch it.
	Jamie looks at Dan with grievances. How can it be possible to bear itching? Won't she be extremely uncomfortable?
	"Dan, I'm uncomfortable ..." Jamie vows that she will never touch those damn perfumes anymore. The idea doesn't come out while she has a lot of red dots.
	The feeling of being itchy makes Jamie nearly cry because she can't scratch it.
	Dan's eyes express distressed feelings. But in order not to let her hurt herself, he doesn't let go of his hands.
	Jamie has no ways because her face is itchy and uncomfortable. So she lowers her face and rubs it on Dan's big hands to ease the discomfort.
	She must smash the perfume if she sees it again in the future.
	Except for the box Ryan gives!
	Dan feels the rubbing of Jamie's face on his hand. The delicate and soft skin slips over his hands, which causes some emotions in his mind.
	Jamie collapses in mind. Fortunately, Jim comes soon. After doing physical examination for Jamie, Jim says that she is just allergy to perfume. As long as the potion is applied on time, there will be no problem.
	Jim wipes his sweat before he leaves. Dan just calls him for this little matter. It really scares him that he almost doesn't even wear his pants. He is afraid that he will be thrown out by Dan if he is too late.
	"I feel terrible. I feel terrible." Jamie feels so itchy that she rolls on the bed. She also cares about her skin, but it is uncomfortable if she bears not to scratch.
	"Throw all the perfumes inside away." Dan is unhappy when he sees the perfume now. Seeing Jamie's red dots, he feels so uncomfortable in his heart.
	Cindy comes in immediately. She takes a bag and starts to clean up the perfume in the room. When she sees the box on the table, Cindy recognizes that this is a perfume with a logo of Moon.
	She also buys perfume for Dan's mother before, so she has some impressions of these brands.
	"Dan, do you want to throw this away?" Cindy knows that Moon's perfume is precious so she asks him again.
	Dan just glances at it indifferently and walks towards the bed with the potion Jim has given. "Throw it away."
	"No!" When Jamie sees Cindy taking her bag while Dan is telling her to throw it away, she suddenly stops rolling and jumps up to grab the box. "This is the perfume that I want to design clothing for. You can't throw it away! "
	Dan is a little annoyed to see her holding the bag in her arms and protecting her seriously. Is the man’s thing so important?
	"Look at the red dots on your body. Will you still want to experience it again?" Dan's words are cruel but all true.
	However, Jamie still refuses to let go. She holds her box and her expression shows stubbornness. Even if her body is uncomfortable, she still looks at him stubbornly, "No, how can I design without it?"
	Well! Well!
	Dan smiles while he is extremely angry, staring at Jamie with anger. "Do you believe that I can terminate the cooperation with few words? And it will be in vain even if your design is wonderful."
	Jamie is in surprise with her eyes widening. She looks at him and says in a weak voice, "You won't do it..."
	There is not much confidence in her words because Dan always does what he says
	"Well." Dan chuckles coldly, watching her with indifference. "If you still know me, you will know whether I will."
	Jamie lowers her head and looks at the box whose logo on it is still so dazzling in her arms.
	Cindy looks at Dan and Jamie anxiously. Why will they become like this while they were fine just now?
	Jamie lowers her head and does not speak. Her right hand unconsciously grabs the back of her left hand because it is itchy. She wishes to clutch it hard and maybe she will feel better.
	"What the hell do you want to do?" Jamie is a little weak. She doesn't want to give up the opportunity to design for the perfume. But she can't go against Dan.
	Dan can see her small movements. When he sees her step backwards, he doesn't feel relax, "Give it to me."
	"I'm not allergic if I don't smell it. Really." Jamie guesses that Dan insists because she is allergic to perfume. So she says so.
	"I don't want to say it again." Dan glares at her slightly, reaching out to her.
	Jamie pouts and put it in his hand reluctantly. Then she turns to the bed, lying on it and staring straightly at the ceiling.
	Dan couldn't help laughing. Is she angry with herself?
	"Take it away and announce that no one in the manor will be allowed to use perfume. Also, try not to use fresheners which have too strong smell." Dan gives the box to Cindy and tells her in low voice.
	Cindy looks at Jamie who is lying on the bed and upset. Jamie wants to scratch but can only endure desperately. Then Cindy leaves after answering him.
	At this time Dan turns around. He picks up the potion and cotton swabs. Then he walks to Jamie and sit down. But she ignores him and stars straightly at the ceiling.
	She seems to intend to protest silently.
	"Sit up and use the potion. Do you want to recover as soon as possible?" Dan touches her arm and sees more and more red dots on it with his sharp eyes. Her skin is a little hurt.
	Jamie doesn't say anything but ignores him. She looks at the ceiling and seems to express that how he will treat her in this condition.
	Dan smiles and picks up the cotton swab to apply the potion on her face. But she knows it and avoids by turning her side around.
	Big boss become quickly mad and he narrows his eyes to looks at Jamie with a dangerous emotion. He gently turns Jamie's face over and looks at her eyes affectionately. "What happens? Are you angry at me?"
	"How dare I do that? How dare I am angry at Mr. William? I still want to live well." Jamie is nervous while she is stared by his eyes. But she still refuses to give up and says what she thinks of.
	"Okay. If you use the potion, maybe I can consider letting you continue your design. If not..."
	Jamie knows what it is without him saying anything.
	
Chapter 125 Use the potion
	As soon as Jamie hears that she still has hope, her eyes lit up suddenly. She looks at with her shining eyes, "Okay, I will use it."
	Seeing her promise, Dan does not feel better but become more depressed.
	Does she want to approach the man by the issues of designing clothes? Or is she actually interested in that man?
	Thinking of this, Dan can't help tightening his hand which holds Jamie's chin. And his eyes looks at her with deterrence, "Tell me why you insist on designing for Moon?"
	Why?
	Jamie frowns and puzzles. Does this need a reason?
	"What reason?"
	She instinctively asks because in her opinion, no reason is needed if she can insist on what she likes to do. Of course she does it because she likes it.
	"Because of Ryan?" Dan continues and ignores her confused look.
	"What does it have anything to do with him?" Jamie twitches his lips and is unable to understand Dan's strange thoughts.
	Dan stares at her eyes for a while and a relief appears in his black eyes. Then he let go of the finger which is holding her chin. He looks down but sees that her right hand is constantly rubbing the back of her left hand, which already turns red.
	"Snap."
	Jamie looks at Dan's big hand which claps on the back of her hand in astonishment. Then she sees him taking away her right hand and staring at her fiercely, "Do you believe that I will cut your hand if you scratch it again?"
	Jamie's hairs stand up when she hears it. She doesn't dare to do it no matter how itchy she is.
	Dan snorts softly and wipes her skin lightly with a cotton swab which is wet by the potion. The cold potion quickly penetrates through the pores. The coolness makes it more comfortable.
	Jamie feels relieved by the relief of the skin. But after a few seconds, the cold feeling spread with a quite pain quickly. It is very fine, and disappears after a while.
	She looks down at Dan who focuses on applying potion on her skin. From her view of angel, she can see his long lashes trembling slightly under the light and leaving a shadow in the eye sockets. His straight nose seems like the master's works which is elaborately carved and every step is just perfect.
	His lips have a light-colored luster, and looks soft and charming. If she keeps staring at it, she can't help but speeds up her heartbeat.
	Jamie is familiar with his appearance that is sober and meticulous. Also his appearance is frivolous and bad. Every time when she sees his dedicated and serious look, her heart seems to beat faster.
	It has to be said that Dan's charm is not deliberately acted. But he can inadvertently show his move and temperament which can make others speed up their heartbeat and confuse others.
	If you ask Jamie, who lives in the past, whether she likes Dan, the answer must be yes.
	But now, does she still like him?
	She doesn't know.
	While she is thinking, Dan has wiped the potion on her face. They are very close to each other. As long as they lean slightly, they can touch each other.
	It is too close that Jamie can feel his warm breath sprays over her cheeks, which makes her heart tremble.
	She looks straight into his black eyes which seem to be the sky full of stars.
	Jamie has never seen such beautiful eyes. The pupils actually look the same, but Dan’s eyes always make you feel like you are looking at a lake. You can't figure it out at all.
	Dan raises her face to wipe her neck. His fingertips gently rub Jamie's skin. As if it is producing a current quickly and clearly.
	Jamie makes her chin high and obediently let him to apply the potion to her neck. She has to say that Jim’s potion is indeed good, and she feels better after it is applied.
	"Wait, Dan. If I use it now, what should I do when I clean it off after taking a shower?" Jamie suddenly thinks of an important question and asks.
	Dan's fingers stops and he still applies it on her neck, "Then you can use it again later."
	He is capricious!
	"Actually, I can apply it by looking in the mirror..." Jamie laughs awkwardly. It is uncomfortable if she keeps lifting her chin like this.
	"What do you say?" Dan's voice is calm without any different emotions. But Jamie still understands his threats from his words.
	"... Nothing." Jamie looks at the ceiling and wants to cry but fails. What can she say?
	"Wow." Dan, the boss, proudly makes some noise by using his fingertips to slightly lift her collar. Then he glances at it and smiles.
	Upon seeing it, Jamie quickly covers her collar and watches him alarmingly, "What do you want to do?"
	Is he acting indecently?
	"Apply potion on it." Dan looks at her with an innocent look and blinks his eyes.
	"I will finish the rest." Jamie is blushed slightly and takes the potion bottle in his hand. She waves at him and wants him to leave.
	"Are you sure you don't need my help?" Dan stands up and raises his eyebrows. He remains calm and composed while he looks at her.
	"No!" Jamie bites her lower lip. If she asks him to help, the more he helps, the worse it will be. And he can see her body under the collar. Won't she suffer losses finally?
	"Okay." Dan unexpectedly doesn't tease her and turns to walk out of the bedroom.
	"Daddy, how's mommy going?" When Ian sees Dan coming out, he immediately hugs his thigh and asks by blinking his big eyes.
	Dan lifts Ian up with one hand. Then he hugs him in his arms and answers with his soft voice, "She is fine."
	"That's good. Can I go in to see mommy?" Ian looks inside through the door and sees Jamie walking into the bathroom with her clothes.
	It seems that Daddy doesn't get mommy.
	"Not now. Your mummy is still applying potion."
	"But bunny can also help mommy apply potion. When mommy is injured before, it is I who do it for mommy." Ian says proudly, raising his chin.
	Is Jamie injured?
	Dan's eyes blinks. He holds Ian to walk into his room and asks, "Is your mommy often injured?"
	Ian looks a little unhappy and bulges his cheeks. They are reluctant to mention the memory during that time. Even if his mommy is laughing and happy now, Ian can't forget at all.
	He has always believed that only when he becomes stronger can he better protect his mummy.
	Dan knows that Ian's expression is bad and there is a sorrow in his eyes which looks like the big grapes. The expression is very inconsistent with the soft and cool appearance he usually shows.
	Although he doesn't want to admit that it is true, the expression that should not appear on Ian's face actually appears.
	It makes Dan clearly anticipate that Jamie and Ian must have encountered something in the five years that he hasn't participated in. Moreover, they must have a very bad life.
	"It's not that often. It's just two or three times a week. She is injured seriously every time but mommy doesn't tell me. I know it's all for me." Ian's voice is a little deep and his expression is serious. Pain flashes in his eyes as if he remembers something.
	"Mommy and I fight with others for a small piece of bread. You will not understand it when you enjoy the delicious food every day.”
Chapter 126 Ian's “trap” .
	"Mommy struggles not to let others take me away. You won't understand it when you enjoy a peaceful and leisure life.”
	"What I say is not to make you sympathize with us. I just want you to treat mommy a little better. If you are not good to her, bunny will take her to leave although I like you very much."
	Ian's words hit Dan's heart strongly like a rock.
	Actually he misunderstands that Jamie has a good life.
	In the five years he does not participate in, he misses too much.
	But Ian's last sentence still gives Dan a lot of comfort. At least, Ian still appreciates his daddy.
	"I'm sorry. Although Daddy does not participate in your past, I will always be with you in future life." Dan's voice is low and he hugs Ian gently. "However, you can't think about leaving secretly. Where do you want to go by taking my woman? "
	Ian sticks his tongue out and laughs secretly. In fact, what he says just wants daddy to cherish his mummy. Otherwise he will immediately let Night.1 prepare to take them away!
	"Daddy, don't forget. Bunny is powerful." Ian tilts his head and looks naughty like a cunning fox.
	"Well. You can try." Dan pinches Ian's face, feeling a little upset.
	It seems that his son has always been thinking about taking Jamie to elope. He must find a way to remain their body and hearts.
	"Bunny is not afraid of you." Ian lifts his chin. Of course he is not afraid. And if he doesn't say these words intentionally, how can he...
	After taking shower in the bathroom, Jamie walks out in her pajamas while water is dripping down her hair. She just put a white dry towel around her hair and wipes her hand with the potion.
	She has already applied it on most of her hurt in the bathroom, but it is inconvenient to apply it on the face and her arm. So she comes out and applies it.
	She walks while using the potion. And the water drops fall along the hairline on the white soft carpet and wet a small piece of it.
	After applying it on her arms and face, Jamie suddenly finds that she cannot touch her back at all. She can't reach her back and she is uncomfortable when she remains a posture for a long time.
	So she put the potion aside. Then she wipes her hair while walking out. She just comes out of the bathroom full of water vapor and her delicate face looks red like an apple.
	She pushes Ian's door and sees that Dan and Ian are sitting on the chair. They are looking at each other angrily. She doesn't know what they are talking about.
	"Mommy." Ian has a sweet smile and looks at Jamie.
	Dan also focuses his gaze on Jamie and then his eyes shrink suddenly.
	Jamie, who just comes out of the bathroom, naturally has great temptation.
	She wears a more conservative gauze nightdress she brings with her skirt over her knees. But the person who just comes out of the bathroom already has a light fragrance on her body. Moreover, water drops are still flowing on the white legs. It really excites his eyes when he sees it.
	Dan is a normal man. He hasn't touched any woman in the past five years. Now he sees this scene and it's impossible not to have reaction.
	Jamie naturally doesn't know what Dan is thinking, beckoning to Ian to let him to come over.
	Ian jumps out of the chair and walks over obediently, "Mommy, what's the matter?"
	"Help me, baby. You have to quickly apply the potion on mommy." Jamie takes Ian and walks while saying these words.
	There are only Dan and Ian here. She cannot ask Dan to serve her. She is also embarrassed to bother Cindy. So Ian is the best person to choose.
	Dan's eyes are dim. He stands up and follows.
	He doesn't know that as soon as he walks to the door, Jamie closes the door with a "bang". Moreover, when Dan twists the door lock in bad expression, he finds that the door is still locked from the inside.
	Mr. William turns annoyed because this woman is really becoming bolder.
	Does she dare to lock him out?
	No, this is not the first time.
	He doesn’t show his expression on his cold face and turns peacefully to get the spare key.
	However, when Dan sees that the space for the spare key is empty. His face expression cannot be described as dark.
	He knows it's Jamie who does this without thinking!
	He strides back upstairs and vigorously beats the door of the master bedroom a few times. His voice is unpleasant, exuding a meaning that the strangers can't approach him, "Open the door!"
	"Daddy, wait." Ian's clear voice comes from the inside, extinguishing Dan's idea to break in.
	He also intends to leave Ian with a good daddy's impression, which must not be destroyed by this matter.
	Dan leans against the wall and bents his calf. He wants to light a cigarette actually. But when he thinks of that Ian hates the smell of cigarettes, he throws the whole pack of cigarettes in the trash.
	After this action, Dan is slightly stunned. But soon, his eyes are occupied by a warm feeling.
	After about five minutes, the door opens.
	Ian walks out from inside and sees him leaning against the wall. He just looks like the bad students he has seen at school. It looks the same as the bad students who are punished by the teacher. They often stand by the wall.
	Ian smirks slyly with his small mouth closed. Daddy must be very depressed. Mummy just tells him not to call daddy when she uses potion. So he must help his daddy.
	Let the daddy and mommy become more intimate as affectionately as possible.
	"Daddy."
	"Well." Dan answers, glancing at Ian. But his eyes turn to the door behind Ian.
	"Mummy asks bunny to help her because mommy can't apply it on her back." Ian blinks at Dan and continues to see Dan's unchanged face. "Why doesn't mummy let daddy help?"
	An embarrassment appears on Dan's face. It is a failure when he is despised by his son.
	"Your mum is just shy." Dan rubs Ian's hair peacefully and explains gently.
	"Really? Why is mommy shy?"
	"Because your mum likes Daddy very much. She will be shy and doesn't dare to let daddy help her." Dan twitches his lips.
	If Jamie is really as shy as he says so she will resist him, then he doesn't have to work so hard.
	That silly woman is born to be stupid. Can't she see how does he treat her?
	"Well, then ... Dad has to apply the potion on mommy in the future. Will Mommy not be shy?" Ian asks with the mentality to ask questions.
	Actually, he laughs in his heart.
	Mummy is probably because she is shy and won't let Daddy help her. But there is only 40% chance that she likes Daddy.
	"Well, yes. Bunny is so smart." Dan follows his words and thinks that he has turned Ian to his side. But he doesn't know that he has fallen into the trap of the little cunning kid.
	
Chapter 127 Dan's birthday
	But even if Dan knows it in advance, he will be willing to jump in.
	Jamie doesn't expect that it is useless for the red dots on her body although she applies the potion. It only makes her not itchy and painless. Perhaps her skin is too special. So after applying the potion for a day, there is no obvious effect.
	She doesn't go out to meet people in this way. Jamie can just wander in the manor.
	Fortunately, the manor is very large. So even if she walks back and forth for a long time, she will not feel bored.
	Moreover, today is Dan's birthday. And Jamie doesn't have time to wander so she can only stay in the manor.
	Jamie doesn't even know until today that the location for celebrating birthday is chosen at Dan's main house but not at here.
	Dan doesn't seem to want strangers come here. And even for Jozo, Jamie hasn't seen her since that day.
	However, the thorn in her heart is still stuck on it and cannot be pulled out.
	The gift is prepared by Jamie in advance and it is a new tie. She doesn't choose it deliberately. Instead when she first sees it, she thinks it is suitable for Dan and buys it.
	The birthday party starts in the evening, and the William family is still preparing for it. So Jamie and Ian are not in a hurry but eat fruits on the sofa in the living room of the villa.
	Dan goes out in the morning. Bruce, Duke and Cindy arranges for the birthday. He doesn't need to do anything.
	Jamie guesses that he must go to see Jozo.
	Jozo gets up early in the morning and asks Alma to find her an internationally renowned makeup artist and a hair stylist. The dress is the latest one in this season. With Dan's relationship, even if she has taken all the new dress but not wears them, no one will dare accuse her.
	For the banquet tonight, Jozo is present for the purpose of attracting eyes with gorgeous beauty and also securing a leading position over Jamie.
	She wants to let Jamie see clearly who is more important in Dan's heart.
	For this, Jozo has spent a lot of time on dressing up. Although her legs can't walk, it doesn't matter at all. She still has temperament and beauty. She wishes to depend on these to become the focus of this banquet.
	"Well, Alma. Dan keeps a necklace he designed by himself in his company. Go get it for me and just say that I want it." Jozo says to Alma while wearing earrings in front of the mirror.
	She has only seen the necklace once. She accidentally sees it in Dan's mobile phone album. It is a beautiful necklace, which meant being lover for a lifetime. She really wants to get it for a long time.
	It says that this necklace has been placed in the CR display cabinet, and no one can take it away.
	Alma frowns and looks at her, "Jozo, it doesn't belong to you. So even Alma can't get it for you."
	That necklace is designed by Dan himself, and it is his only design. She once hears Dan mention that the necklace is for someone he liked when he was a child. And now it seems to belong to Jamie.
	"Doesn't it belong to me? Who does it belong to?" Jozo's eyes are full of unwillingness and she is not willing that it belongs to others when she has expected to own it for a long time.
	Like the man she has always loved, he is not hers now.
	"You've seen her and she is Jamie." Alma replies calmly. Because she will answer anything Jozo asks clearly.
	It really is her.
	Jozo sneers and doesn't ask Alma to get the necklace anymore. She asks Alma to pick a necklace with a price over millions.
	Jamie is lying on the sofa and watching anime, holding a fruit platter in her hand. Ian is playing with a laptop aside. It is also quiet and peaceful.
	"Jamie, answer the phone quickly! Answer the phone and answer the phone! If you don't answer the phone, your ass will be kicked!" Jamie's suddenly hand which holds an apple trembles. She doesn't know when the ringtone is replaced. But she turns to stare at Ian who looks innocent and is shrugging. She then answers the call.
	"Hello?"
	"Jamie." It is Ryan.
	"Ryan? Is there anything?" Jamie's eyes fix on the TV's screen and she asks subconsciously.
	"Don't you go to work recently? I come to CR and I don't see you." Ryan's voice is clear and soft and it sounds comfortably.
	"I'm sick. So I take a week off. You can rest assured that the design draft you want will be finished soon." Although there is no idea now, Jamie still shrugs.
	She knows that the more you force yourself to do something, the less likely it is to complete. And so does the design. If you force yourself to draw, it makes you more upset and anxious. In the end, you can't draw anything and you lose your own good mood.
	Therefore, Jamie has always held the belief that she will never draw without any ideas. She will begin when she has ideas.
	It is precisely because of this belief that the design drafts she draws will never give people a rigid feeling. Her design has a brisk style which is as free as the wind but full of emotion.
	Someone once commented that from the design behind, they can see a distinctive designer style and characteristics on her works.
	In other words, it is her works that shows her personality.
	"What? Are you sick? I'll come to see you now." Ryan's usual soft and low voice becomes anxious for the first time, and he is really worried about her.
	"No, it's not a big deal. I'm just allergic to perfume. It will be fine in a few days." Jamie quickly refuses, thinking that even Jozo, who has a close relationship with Dan, cannot come here. And Ryan will be able to see her even if he comes. It is better not to waste time to come here.
	"Perfume allergy?" Ryan's eyes narrows and he remembers that he takes her to the perfume R&D room that day. So now he really can't wait to throw the perfume on the table.
	Knowing that she will feel sick after smelling the perfume, he still suggests to take her to see it. Anyway, it is his fault.
	"Yes." Jamie doesn't want Ryan to feel guilty and she laughs. "Today is Dan's birthday, so I have to wait for him. I'll see you when I'm fine."
	"..." Is today Dan's birthday? Ryan's eyes are a bit bleak. He just wants to stand up but sits back. "It's okay. Maybe I'll see you tonight. You can rest and recuperate."
	"Well, okay." Jamie smiles and answers him. Then she hangs up the phone without thinking about what Ryan means. She continues to eat and watch TV.
	Sometimes, it's really good to be so careless.
	Ryan rubs his eyebrows and leans his back on the top of the chair back. He turns the office chair and looks up at the white ceiling with warm eyes.
	"You know she feels sick with the perfume and you still take her there. What the hell are you thinking?" The voice that only he can hear appears in the office. The voice is full of anger, as if he is accusing himself.
	
Chapter 128 Being lovers for a lifetime
	Ryan's movements remain the same, but his eyes are closed. “It's better not to ask anything that you shouldn't ask. You don't understand something at all.”
	Some things are really compelling.
	He sighs slightly, as if he is regretting something. "It's a pity. Why do you treat her like this? Don't you like her very much?"
	After saying that, it is silent. For a long time, Ryan straightens his body and looks at some place in the office. His eyes are dim, and the smile is a little bitter. "You don't understand."
	The voice doesn’t answer again, as if it never appears.
	...
	When Cindy takes the dress and jewelry that Jamie is going to wear tonight to her, Jamie is indeed a little surprised.
	Not because of how expensive this dress is, but because this dress is definitely a design drafts that she draws in her spare time. Dan actually makes it into a finished product secretly, and the details are so delicate that she can’t help being amazed.
	"These are prepared by Dan earlier. Jamie, you can have a look at it. And for this necklace, Dan orders that you must wear it tonight." Cindy says with a smile and opens the other box which has a silver necklace inside.
	In fact, the necklace is very simple. It is not thick but thin. If you see it carefully, you can see that there are chains of hearts on it with a ring hanging in the middle.
	This ring is the core of this necklace.
	Others may not know it, but Jamie knows it most clearly. The essence of the entire necklace is the ring.
	This is the concept she put forward when she was a child, but she doesn’t expect that Dan will make it.
	The ring is hollowed out, and the hollowed areas are inlaid with pink diamonds, which are very small. However, the pink diamonds are no less than one hundred one if it needs to become a round. They form a shape of delicate rose in the middle. In the center of the stamen, it is embedded with a black diamond, which makes the ring pure and charming.
	The meaning is AordLover. Being lovers for a lifetime.
	The black diamond in the center of the stamen and the pink diamonds on the surface of the ring refracts a dazzling under the light.
	Jamie glances at the ring and looks away, smiling at Cindy, "Cindy, change my clothes."
	"Yes, Jamie." Cindy takes the box and looks at Ian, "Bunny, let's go. Cindy will change your clothes for you."
	Ian shakes his head. "No need, Cindy. Bunny will change it by me."
	Ian still doesn't want to trouble others with trials like changing clothes.
	"Okay." Cindy smiles happily, only thinking Ian is very thoughtful. And then she follows Jamie and goes upstairs.
	It has to be said that Dan has excellent taste. The evening gown he personally selects is tailored and fits well with her.
	Jamie checks the skirt before the full-length mirror and touches it. The texture of this dress is smooth and soft, and it is very comfortable to wear.
	Everyone has a wish for being beautiful and Jamie has no exception. No one will be in a bad mood when she sees herself being beautiful.
	"Jamie, I'll wear this necklace for you." Cindy takes the necklace out of the box and is about to wear it for Jamie.
	Jamie looks at the necklace. A complex feeling flashes through her eyes, and at last she says nothing. She just let Cindy put it on for her.
	When the necklace touches the skin, the biting cold spreads along the collarbone. She doesn’t know if her heart or the necklace is cold. It makes Jamie feel a little cold.
	Even if she doesn't say some things, it doesn't mean she has forgotten.
	"Jamie is born so beautiful, and will definitely be the most charming ladies at the banquet tonight." Cindy looks at Jamie in the mirror and praises sincerely.
	Jamie raises her lips, looking at the delicate and elegant people in the mirror. She looks charming and pure well and it seems natural.
	The banquet starts at seven o'clock, and Jamie leaves the manor at six o'clock. It takes a total of forty minutes to drive from the manor to the main house of William’s family, so Jamie is not in a hurry.
	She is so anxious that Dan plans to make Ian's identity public today.
	She can’t understand his mind any more. According to his performance in these days, he likes Ian. Otherwise, it won't be like this today.
	So Jamie guesses that it is probably because Ian is born and appears in front of him. So he has to admit him.
	She does not know.
	In the bottom of heart, she still resists to let Dan make Ian's identity public.
	That's right. She still resists.
	Does he want to recognize his son after five years so easily? Her baby son can’t be recognized casually by his mind.
	Jamie's eyes flashes slightly, and her whole person gradually recovers from the quietness and calmness in these days.
	Jamie asks the driver to turn around and drives to Wendy’s apartment. Here is very close to Wendy’s apartment and they arrive in about ten minutes.
	"You can wait here and we'll be back in a moment." Jamie holds Ian to open the door and walks out of the car while commanding.
	"But Jamie, Dan’s party is about to begin ..." Before the driver finishes talking, he sees Jamie and Ian walking into the apartment and disappears.
	Ding. Ding.
	Jamie and Ian come to the door of Wendy's apartment and ring the doorbell.
	After a while, the door opens. Wendy comes out to open the door in an evening dress, wearing a pair of high heels.
	Jamie almost can’t help widening her eyes and she can’t believe she is Wendy.
	This is the first time she sees Wendy wearing a skirt. It's totally too scary!
	"What ... what are you doing by wearing a skirt?" Jamie leans against her and a surprise flashes in her eyes. It has to say that Wendy is more ladylike and not so manly when she put on the skirt.
	Wendy pulls them into the house and brings them into the living room, "What are you here? Jamie, Dan's birthday party is held at tonight. Why don't you come but meet me?"
	"I still want to ask you what you want to do. Don't you be afraid to scare others to death at night?" Jamie pinches the corner of her skirt and really dislikes it.
	"Aunt Wendy, hello." Ian calls her sweetly, sitting next to Jamie.
	"Good boy..." Wendy glances gently at Ian and turns her head to see Jamie with fierce look, "Little bitch, what are you saying? Duke calls me and invites me to go. Otherwise, do you think will I be willing to wear this one? "
	Jamie raises her eyebrows in surprise. Duke who is so stubborn will actually invite Wendy to the banquet?
	"Well, it seems that good things are coming." Jamie smiles happily for her best girlfriends. Suddenly she thinks of something and grabs Wendy's shoulders, "Are you going to participate in the banquet?"
	Who will take care of Ian if she goes to the party?
	Ian blinks innocently and finally figures out the reason why Jamie suddenly changes her mind. But he doesn’t feel lost at all because he feels that mommy must have her reason for doing so.
	When Jamie returns to the car, she stays with Wendy. As for Ian...
Chapter 129 the Siege from Journalists
	"Night.1, please prepare a car for me, and let's go to the party." Ian Moore says to Night.1 when he sees the car downstairs leaves away.
	"Yes, young master." Night.1 gives a call to Night.7, and then he goes downstairs together with Ian Moore.
	He still needs to give gift to his daddy. How can he be absent?
	The main house of the William Family is not far from the house of the Moore Family. Of course, Dan William also invites Jack Moore. After all, in his eyes, he is still Jamie Moore's father, and he should show this respect to Jack Moore.
	Because it's a birthday party, thus Dan William does not want to hold in a large way. But tonight he will introduce Ian Moore's identity to the outside world. So Dan William comes to prepare in the morning especially. He even invites some media. He intends to let the whole country know about this.
	But he doesn't know that Jamie Moore has made a big mess for him on the way.
	When Jamie Moore and Wendy come to the Moore Family, it’s almost ten minutes before the party begins. If it isn't for the driver's fear that he would be punished by Dan William, he would never have worked hard to drive the car as if the car is flying. It’s just too deadly.
	Jamie, your driver is awesome. Can you see my hairstyle?" Wendy is still a little dizzy when she gets out of the car. She says to Jamie Moore with her hand points at the hair style.
	"It's not mine, and it's Dan William." Jamie Moore rolls at Wendy, and then she walks into the William Family with Wendy.
	Usually, even though her hair looks like a chicken's nest, she will just wipe her hair calmly. Wendy is a woman who could run downstairs to the supermarket in her pajamas and slippers. What do you want her to take care of?
	Jamie Moore could only signs for this. The power of love is really great.
	"Finally, he will be your driver, am I right? You could not be so polite to him. He owes you so much, and he will never pay for it.” Wendy doesn't care about it. She takes out her mobile phone and arranges her make-up with the reflection of the screen. She smiles when she reminds that she will see her lover soon.
	This is the first time that he has an appointment with her after Jamie Moore leaves. She must leave a good impression on him!
	On the one hand, Wendy is ready to do a big thing. On the other side, Jamie Moore shrugs her shoulders and then walks into the gate of the villa.
	Crack.
	When Jamie Moore and Wendy walk into the room, they hear a loud bang on the top of their heads. Then all kinds of fireworks fall from the top of their heads, and then fall their shoulders and hair, which stuns them for a long time.
	"Oh! The surprise which Dan William says is Miss Moore!”
	In a daze, Jamie Moore listen the words of the audience, and then she feels that the flash flashes across her face, and then she looks at the front.
	The red carpet has been paved from the door to the end. There are some media reporters and some people she familiars standing on both sides, but she doesn’t know most of them.
	At the end of the red carpet, there is familiar figure standing under the Swarovski crystal chandelier on the revolving stairs. The man wears the famous man's handmade suit of Italian, and black is suitable for him. The man looks very cold, which makes people fright.
	The handsome face is shining under the warm light, and the light is sprinkling on his hair and shoulders. And then he looks at her calmly.
	He presses her lips, and it seems that she smiles at her.
	Jamie Moore looks at him in a trance. It seems that the man in front of him has a kind of natural magic. He can easily take away all the eyes of others. He stands still under the amazing eyes of others, which attracts other people.
	However, she is also a beautiful view in the eyes of the man in front of her.
	Today, the evening dress of Jamie Moore is made by the designer of the Dan William’s company. The designer changes the casual clothes into a stunning dress.
	The color of the dress is white, which just like the wedding dress. It is designed with slanted shoulder and hollow waist. The skirt is like waves. As soon as she moves, the skirt is like waves, which ripples gently. It seems that she just like the spirit from the Western myth, which attracts all of the people.
	When some famous ladies in the party sees Jamie Moore, they suddenly lost the courage to flatter.
	"Miss Moore, I heard that you left country C five years ago. When did you return home?" When reporter sees Jamie Moore, they all come to her as if they see the headlines of tomorrow. They siege Jamie Moore with some bad words. Wendy, who stands beside Jamie Moore, is also trapped in this thing.
	"Why did you leave? Does Mr. William abandon you? Or does Mr. William fall in love with each?”
	"Can you answer me, please?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she looks at the enthusiastic reporters. She frowns, and she doesn’t want to answer these questions. What’s more, she has no obligation to answer them.
	These enthusiastic reporters who only want to pursue enthusiasm and hot spots. They can't ask Dan William, thus how can they let go of Jamie Moore?
	Jamie Moore wants to leave away with Wendy, but these reporters all stay around at them. It seems that they will never let Jamie Moore if Jamie Moore doesn’t saying anything satisfied to them today.
	Jamie Moore is afraid of this. She doesn’t want to make trouble with Dan William. But Wendy will never do this. She always has a bad temper, and she could not bear that her best friend being bullied. She pushes reporter away, which almost makes the reporter fall down.
	Anyway, she is neither a celebrity nor a star. She is just an ordinary girl. She is not afraid of this. What can these people do with her?
	"Do journalists have any ability? Do all of you take the thing of others?” Wendy snorts. She looks at the reporters, and it seems that she doesn’t fear anything.
	"Lady, even you are Miss Moore's friend, you can't push people casually, can you? What about hurting people?" however, those reporters are very cunning. They take the advantage of Wendy’s mistake, which annoy other people.
	Jamie Moore guards Wendy behind her and she looks at them. "What’s wrong? If you have the ability, you can drive me out of country C. Otherwise, what's the use of just shouting?"
	Arrogant, Jamie Moore says in an arrogant way absolutely.
	However, the reporter is more excited, it seems that they have found a new hot spot, and they all take the photos.
	However, they seem to forget that Jamie Moore is Ian Moore’s mother. Even if Jamie Moore hasn't come back for five years, will Dan William let them bully his son's mother?
	They all want to end their career.
	Dan William walks all the way along the red carpet, and he puts his hand in his pockets. He walks to Jamie Moore.
	Seeing that Dan William walks toward them, those reporters automatically gave up a way to let him pass.
	Dan William glances coldly at the reporters around Jamie Moore. Seeing that there are so many people stay around Jamie Moore, his eyesight become cold. He walks to Jamie Moore, and then he holds Jamie Moore in his arms, and then he stares at the reporter who has bad idea on Jamie Moore.
	He lowers his head down, and then he looks at the sign on the reporter's chest. Then he says, “Orange magazine?"
	
Chapter 130 We even have a child. Do we have any relationship?
	The reporter swallows his saliva and then he looks at Dan William with some fear, but finally he nods.
	"Derek William." Dan William asks.
	"Young master." Derek William comes to Dan William and then he answers.
	"Throw him out of here. And I don't want to see the existence of this magazine in a day." Dan William says coldly. He glances at the reporters with warning eyes, and then he leaves with Jamie Moore in his arms.
	The reporter's face turns white. He knows something bad will happen to him. Not only does he lose his job, but also the whole magazine would suffer difficulties.
	Derek William picks the reporter up with one hand, and then he throws him out.
	Other reporters tremble when they see this scene. Just now, the reporter just wants to get close to Miss Moore, but Dan William sees this, and then such thing happens....
	It makes them know clearly that they can’t offend or they even can’t get close to some people....
	Seeing that Dan William walks away with Jamie Moore, Wendy decides to look for Duke Field. Finally, she looks at the corner. Then she walks to the corner with a smile.
	She scolds as she walks. It’s so bad to wear a high-heeled shoe. If she wears this shoes for a night, her feet would swell in the morning.
	"It’s OK now, please let me go now." Jamie Moore mentions Dan William to let her go. She looks at the behind. Those reporters can’t get anything from Jamie Moore, thus they walk away.
	But she doesn’t understand why Dan William let so many reporters come in?
	"Where is baby?" Dan William stands still, and the he asks.
	The reason that he holds this party is for Ian Moore. But now Jamie Moore comes, and he doesn’t see Ian Moore. Jamie Moore should be stay with Ian Moore, thus he feels with strange about this.
	"He doesn’t come here.” Jamie Moore shrugs. At this time, the party should have started. How can she feel the atmosphere inside is a little strange.
	"What's the matter?" Dan William frowns gently. There is a touch of worry in his eyes. Is he ill?
	"Nothing. He just doesn’t want to come here, so I leave him at home." Now Jamie Moore is good at telling lies, thus she says calmly.
	Dan William smiles suddenly, and then he looks at Jamie Moore, "You must have forced him to stay at home, right? I'll ask someone to take him here right now. "
	"There is no need to do this." Jamie Moore says, "What do you want to do next? Do you want to tell the world that he's your son? Then the whole world will ask that who is the mommy of the child? Dan William, do we have any relationship if Ian Moore is not here?"
	Dan William frowns, and then he suddenly reminds of something after hearing Jamie Moore’s words.
	lover? Husband and wife? None of them.
	It seems that they don’t have any relationship except Ian Moore.
	However, Dan William is still upset. She says so clearly. It turns that she wants to get rid of the relationship with him.
	So Dan William makes a very amazing move—
	He raises Jamie Moore's chin with his fingers, and then he kisses Jamie Moore lightly. It’s like a dragonfly's kiss. The strong masculine smell comes to Jamie Moore suddenly.
	"We even have a child. Don’t you think we have relationship?" Dan William says in a deep and magnetic way, and his voice is full of sweet.
	Those reporters have been paying attention to their actions. Thus they record the action Dan William did to Jamie Moore. It’s full of aestheticism.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t except that he would be such a hooligan in front of the public, and it’s the first time that he kisses her in front of so many people. Thus her face turns red, and it’s redder than ever before.
	She beats the chest of Dan William petulantly and angrily. Why does he always do something bad to her? One day she will eat it back!
	"Well? Don’t you think we have a relationship?" Dan William come close to her ear and patiently challenges the limit of Jamie Moore. He takes a breath gently beside her earlobe, which is full of provocation.
	Jamie Moore feels that there is an electric current flowing through her body. Her ears are the most sensitive part of the body. Even a little blow could make her senses stronger than usual.
	"No!" Jamie Moore wants to stay away from Dan William, but he holds her waist, so she has to stagger his lips and turns her face to one side. One could see her white neck, which is soft and charming.
	Dan William smiles suddenly. He glances at the reporters. It seems that these photos will come out tomorrow.
	"Dan." The sweet voice sounds from the door. People all see a beautiful woman. The woman looks very graceful and and beautiful.
	But it’s a pity that this woman is sitting in a wheelchair, making all the male compatriots present sigh secretly, but all of them looks at her.
	Jozo sits in a wheelchair. Alma, who dresses in black and wears black sunglasses, pushes her into the room. Jozo asks Alma to wear this clothes, and the aim is to show the beautiful of herself. As expected, she successfully grabs all the sights when compares with Alma.
	Jamie Moore keeps silent. She looks at the Jozo who walks toward them, and then she finds Dan William puts down his arm suddenly. She lowers her head for a while, and then she smiles at Jozo.
	"Why are you here?" Dan William looks at Jozo. He frowns, and then he looks at Jamie Moore. But he finds Jamie Moore is smiling, and she shows no dissatisfaction with the appearance of Jozo.
	"Alma told me that today is your birthday, so I want to celebrate it for you." Jozo picks up the gift box in his hand and then she shakes it to Dan William, and she smiles cleverly.
	Alma is once again forced to be cannon fodder.
	"If you have anything to do in the future, you can just tell Alma. It's not convenient for you to walk now. You should put good rest first." Dan William takes over the box and then hands it to Derek William. He says to Jozo gently.
	Jozo is very happy. She smiles at Dan William sweetly, “OK, I know you care about me most."
	Those reporters have begun to guess the identity of Jozo. Since Dan William treats her so well, so she is not an ordinary people. Maybe Miss Moore will lose the love from Mr. William.
	Jamie Moore looks at them in silence. She is not angry, and she just looks at them with a blank face.
	She has never seen Dan William be so patient to a person. Now he is so gentle and doting, and he is full of patience. It seems that that woman is his girlfriend.
	At least, he has never been so patient to her.
	Jamie Moore never finds that Dan William is patient and gentle with her for most of the time.
	"You could take with each other, and I will find Wendy now.” Jamie Moore says with a smile, and then she turns away without any hesitation.
	Dan William frowns slightly. He is in a dizzy when he looks at the back of Jamie Moore.
	It seems that Jamie Moore doesn’t care his action right now. The reason he uses such way to test her is that he doesn’t have any confidence in himself. Dan William has no confidence when he meets Jamie Moore.

Chapter 131 It Seems that Mommy is Jealous
	Dan William frowns and his eyes are full of frustration and dispirited.
	"Oh, it seems that mommy is jealous." Ian Moore sits on the roof of the villa with a telescope.
	"Daddy is so stupid. Why doesn't he explain this to mommy? What is he doing there?" Ian Moore mutters as he looks. Night.1 watches all around carefully to ensure his safety.
	"Ouch, the baby is dying! Who releases this woman out, Night.1?" Ian Moore rolls his eyes when he sees Jozo. He knows this woman. Although he isn't there last time, a servant secretly told him that this woman ran into the manor to make trouble with mommy. At last, Daddy takes this woman away.
	How can Mommy be in a bad mood for no reason, so it is!
	"Don't worry, young master. Miss Moore will handle this thing easily.” Night.1 is very calm, and he asks Ian Moore to calm down. He believes that Jamie Moore is the king.
	"It seems that mommy is jealous. It will be more serious if daddy doesn't coax her." Ian Moore continues to looks with the telescope. He looks like 007 prying for information. He is still dressed in black and small.
	Since mommy doesn’t want him to come here, thus he can’t only do this. He must fights for the happiness of Mommy and Daddy!
	"This woman can't dance. What does she always stay with my daddy? Hum, Night.1, what is the name of this kind of person between loving couple?" Ian Moore asks.
	After thinking for a few seconds, he says solemnly, "Young master, this kind of person is called the other woman."
	But it seems that Mr. William and Miss. Moore are not lovers...Night.1 coughs, and then he turns around.
	"Yes, yes, that's it!" Ian Moore shakes his feet excitedly and continues to observe the following situation.
	"Ah! Why is Godfather here?" Ian Moore points the telescope in one direction, and Ryan Jack's figure appears in the sight.
	He dresses himself in a white tuxedo suit. He looks handsome and gentle. And he smiles warmly.
	"Here the godfather is. Everything will be OK. He's going to beat the bad woman away." Ian Moore holds his face and squints his big eyes. He feels a little regrets.
	"Young master, then Miss Moore will beat your little butt." Night.1 reminds him coolly. He sees that Ian Moore is beaten by his mommy for several times in the dark. She beats lightly, but Ian Moore wrinkles his handsome face, and it looks very pitiful.
	"Don't mention this!" Ian Moore puffs his check, and his face is red.
	Although Mommy beats him lightly, as a man, how can he be beaten on the butt?
	Jozo always stays with Dan William, thus Dan William can’t go to find Jamie Moore. Thus all the people present there looks at Jozo.
	"Dan, I want to eat that thing." Jozo points the Matcha cake on the rectangular table. She shakes his arm, and says in a coquettish way.
	"Alma, bring it to Miss Jozo." Dan William says to Alma, who stays behind him. Alma nods and then puts the cake in the plate and gives it to Jozo.
	Jozo reluctantly takes over and looks at Alma gloomily. She doesn't want Alma to take it to her. She just wants Dan William to take care of her.
	Dan William pushes Jozo to the rest place and sits down. He looks at the figure that seems to be playing in the opposite corner. From here, he can hear the laugh from there and it seems that she is very happy.
	A familiar figure breaks into the sight. Then Dan William finds it’s Ryan Jack.
	Jozo looks at the direction that Dan William looks, and then she finds Jamie Moore is playing with a group of people. They are laughing. Now she doesn’t need to pretend to be a lady in front of the media. She would laugh if she wants to. It really made people envious.
	"Dan, what are they playing with? Shall we go and have a look?" Jozo holds Dan William’s clothes, and then she says sweetly. Her beautiful eyes are painted with a shallow eye shadow. And it looks very beautiful.
	Dan William wants to go there. Hearing Jozo's words, he nods and pushes her towards the corner.
	Bruce Hill sits beside Jamie Moore, and Duke Field and Wendy sits opposite them. They are playing cards. Because they are just playing games, there is no chip on the table.
	"Four tens." Bruce Hill is in a hurry when he sees Jamie Moore give four tens without hesitation. Elder sister, what bomb do you put when someone gives a six? It's useless.
	"Wait a minute, you can't give this card, and you should give this card.” Bruce Hill holds Jamie Moore’s hand hurriedly. They are a group. If Jamie Moore loses, he can't go on.
	However, Jamie Moore doesn’t have any understanding toward this, thus she just gives the cards she wants to give.
	"Bruce Hill, how can you repent?" Wendy points at the card that has been withdraw by Jamie Moore. She is laughing.
	"It's OK. Give them one more chance. They can't win anyway." Duke Field plays his card calmly, and then he says lightly.
	They all know that Jamie Moore is a poker idiot. She doesn’t know anything about fighting the landlord. Thus she will be loser every time.
	If they add chips to it, Jamie Moore will lose all her things.
	"Wait a minute, sister. Can you stop playing as good a card as you can?" Bruce Hill presses the card that Jamie Moore is going to play. It's speechless. He has to stare at every card that Jamie Moore plays. Is that interesting?
	Jamie Moore frowns and then she stares at Bruce Hill, "What’s matter? You're good. You fight for me. You hold it in both hands. "
	Then she throws her card to Bruce Hill as she says.
	Bruce Hill's face is so bitter. He dares not to receive the card, thus he withdraws his hands and says, “OK, you play you own card.”
	Jamie Moore snorts, and she decides not to give the cad she wants to give. She looks at the card, and she is thinking.
	However, these different kinds of cards are the same in her eyes, and she could not see anything at all.
	“Jamie, it’s your turn, quickly.” Wendy smiles proudly. She looks at the Duke Field, and her hearts jumps heavily.
	"Wait, what's the hurry?" Jamie Moore stares at the card in her hand, and she hopes that she could see through it.
	"Give this card.” The strong masculine smell suddenly presses down on her, and she could smell a faint mint fragrance. Jamie Moore is surprised, and then one of her cards is taken away and put on the table.
	She turns around and then she finds Dan William has come to her side. He puts his hand on her shoulder, and then he holds her hand gently. He puts his head on her cheek. She turns around, and then she kisses her cheek.
	A strange feeling flashes by.
	Bruce Hill comes to the part of Wendy and Duke. Jamie Moore stares at him, and then says, “Traitor!"
	"I......" Bruce Hill looks at Jamie Moore and Dan William bitterly. Since Dan William is here, how can he sit next to Jamie Moore?
	
Chapter 132Who Dares to Compete with Dan William?
	"It's not fun to play like this. Add chips." Dan William looks at the card in Jamie Moore’s hand, and then he says lightly.
	The expression of Bruce Hill and Duke Field changes after hearing the words of Dan William.
	Who dares to compete with Dan William? They have gambled from childhood to adulthood, but they didn't win him once.
	Every time Jamie Moore loses money, he will take it back from them. Thus they will lose all the money suddenly.
	"Brother, there is no need to..." Bruce Hill wants to leave the card and run away suddenly. However, Dan William looks at him in a threaten way. Maybe he will be caught by Derek William before he goes out.
	"Well?" Dan William glances at Bruce Hill lightly, and then Bruce Hill sits down immediately for fear.
	Don't make trouble with him in such a way.
	Bruce Hill is in a bad face. He slowly takes out his wallet from his pocket and puts it on the table.
	Wendy silently puts her purse on the table, and then she looks at Jamie Moore imploringly. She doesn't ask for anything, and she only expects that she will not loss too much money.
	Duke Field puts his wallet down calmly. He knows that he will lose soon, thus he wants to loss in a beautiful way.
	"Don't interfere it, and I will do it." The eyes of Jamie Moore are bright as she sees the money on the table. It seems that there are countless tickets with wings flying in front of her. After saying to Dan William, she puts his pockets on the table proudly.
	Dan William doesn’t do anything, and he just leans against the chair, and he looks at Jamie Moore in a lazy way.
	Jozo presses her lips, and her beautiful eyes are full of jealousy. She stays with them, but she can't laugh with them. It makes her very reluctant.
	"Dan William, can I play with you?" Jozo comes to them in a wheelchair. She comes to the table, and she looks around, and her eyes are full of expectation.
	Dan William doesn’t speak anything, but he looks at Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore raises her eyebrow and says, “Of course, if Miss Jozo can do it, you can join us.”
	"Of course, I can do it," Jozo nods gracefully.
	The happy atmosphere suddenly becomes quiet for the appearance of Jozo. Bruce Hill finds the atmosphere is wrong, and then he plays the card skillfully.
	But the landlord can only be played by four people. Seeing this, Wendy sits next to Duke Field. “I can’t just watch all of you.” thus she relieves. She is afraid that she will lose everything.
	Jamie Moore always wants to do this. She holds the card on the table. She puts the card on the table happily, and her eyes are full of light.
	Seeing this, Dan William presses his lips, and his eyes are full of love.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field relieves when they find it’s Jamie Moore who will play the game.
	"A pair of three."
	“A pair of ten.”
	"A pair of A."
	"No, I can’t hold it."
	"Three A and one four."
	"No, I can’t hold it."
	“...”
	"Four sevens."
	"No, I can’t hold it."
	"Two kings!" Bruce Hill puts the card on the table. He has no card on his hand, thus he is very excited, “Give money to me."
	Among this, Jamie Moore says no most. She thinks she will not loss if she keeps the card to the end. But now a game has passed, and the cards in her hand are almost the same as the beginning.
	It’s too bad. She even doubts that they all cheat her. Otherwise, how could they win her every time?
	Jamie Moore opens the pocket gloomily. After giving money to Bruce Hill, she is ready to start next game.
	"Bombing!"
	"Bombing!"
	"Bombing!"
	"Shunzi!"
	Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!
	How could there be so many bombings?
	Seeing that Bruce Hill and Duke Field is very proud, Jamie Moore almost wants to crush the cards in her hands. She looks at the cards in her hands in a bad way!
	Every time, she is the loser!
	What's more, even Jozo wins a game, but she has lost all her money!
	She is so sad. She doesn’t get any money from others, bur she has lost all her money!
	Dan William shakes his head, and then he looks at Jamie Moore’s card on the table. It’s clearly a very good card. Moreover, as long as she plays four cards when Duke Field plays his card, and then she will win.
	She is so stupid.
	Jamie Moore holds the card well. But she feels sad, because she always loses, thus she feels very boring.
	"I can do it." Dan William's hands pass through her waist and then he takes the card in her hand.
	"OK, you do it.” Jamie Moore can't care so much. As long as he can win money for her, he could do it. But she doesn’t how ambiguous their posture is.
	The small body of Jamie Moore lies in Dan William’s body. He holds Jamie Moore in his arm, and it seems that they are very close with each other.
	The expression of Duke Field and Bruce Hill changes suddenly and then they say, “Let’s stop here, time is too late...”
	"It’s just nine o'clock. Don’t tell lie to us. You don’t have wife at home.” Jamie Moore takes her phone out and then she looks at the time. Ten she snorts and she raises her eyebrow proudly toward Bruce Hill and Duke Field.”
	Hum, they should returns all the money back, and no one could get her money.
	Bruce Hill’s face suddenly becomes gloomy. It’s true that he doesn’t have wife. Is this his fault? He has a handsome face. Is this his fault?
	"It’s true that he is handsome, but is that his fault?” Bruce Hill mumbles, and he is reluctant to plays cards.
	"Are you handsome as Dan William? Are you rich as Dan William?" Jamie Moore smiles cunningly. She pokes the handsome face of Dan William. She smiles happily and loudly. This sentence is so familiar!
	Bruce Hill keeps silent. Otherwise, he will lose the game if he cares about other thing.
	"Wow, Dan William, you are so great. Can you help me? Jozo says to Dan William and she looks at Dan William.
	"It’s impossible. Can't you see that my brother and Little Jamie is a couple? What do you want to do with that?" Bruce Hill is always frank. He will say everything he wants to say. He feels unhappy when he hears Jozo’s words. Thus he takes Jozo as the biggest enemy.
	"I don't want to do anything to them, but I think Dan William is very powerful, and I want to learn from him." Jozo does not feel embarrassed at all, and she says in a graceful way.
	"Are you Jozo? I thought you and Bruce Hill are brothers and sisters." Wendy is also a girl, thus she could get Jozo’s thinking at once. She even knows the little tricks did by Jozo. In Wendy’s eyes, all of this is just small things.
	
Chapter 133 the Beauty is Sad, and Don't You Comfort Her?
	In the past, when she pursues Duke Field, she sees many beautiful women stays around Duke Field.
	Jozo must have idea on Dan William.
	Otherwise, why does she always look at Dan William? Do there something bad with her eyes?
	"It’s impossible. My family only has one child, that’s me. I don’t have sister.” Bruce Hill denies when he hears Wendy’s words. Then he shakes his head. He looks at Jozo, and it seems that he believes people with such gene will not be his family!
	The expression of Jozo changes as she hears the words of Bruce Hill. She never expects that Bruce Hill will have idea on her face. Before she comes here, it takes her several hours to make up. How could they dislike her?
	In fact, Bruce Hill doesn’t have any malice, but he speaks straightforwardly. People around him are used to his straightforwardness, but in Jozo’s eyes, he is find trouble with her.
	Jozo looks at Dan William, and then she lowers her head.
	The atmosphere becomes quiet. Jamie Moore puts the card on the table angrily, and then she says to Dan William, “Beauty is sad, and don't you comfort her?"
	Dan William frowns, and there is a touch of displeasure in his black eyes. The breath on his body is cold. He looks at her with confirmation. "Are you sure?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She hesitates for a while. If Dan William goes to help Jozo, it mean that she will be the loser.
	What’s more, she doesn’t want Dan William help Jozo.
	"I know it now." Dan William sees the little movements of her in the eyes, and then he presses his lips. He looks at Jozo who is very sad and then says to Alma, “Alma, Miss Jozo is tired, and she should have a rest now."
	Jozo looks up in surprised. She looks at Dan William incredulously. Tears still remain in her eyes. Is he driving her away?
	He drives her out just for the words of Jamie Moore. It's like that she has been beaten by other!
	"Dan William..." Jozo still wants to say something. Tonight's goal has not been fully achieved. She can't leave like this.
	"Jozo." Dan William interrupts Jozo's words. His eyes are deep and dark, which is hard to understand. "Go back now."
	The word is very clear.
	It can be seen that Dan William has shown enough respect to Jozo, and he doesn’t drive her out directly. He even gives a way to her, which is the biggest limit.
	Jozo drags her clothes, and she is unwilling to damage her image, but she has no way to do.
	"Well, you should remember to come to see me." Jozo smiles at Dan William and then says goodbye to him. Then she is pushed away by Alma.
	As soon as Jozo turns around, her face suddenly sinks, and her black and white eyes are full of hatred.
	How deep the resentment in her heart is, how powerful the power of Jozo is. She loves Dan William, thus she will do everything to get him!
	"We still need a person. Wendy, you do it.” After Jozo leaves, Bruce Hill says to Wendy. Jamie Moore can’t join them to play card. She plays card so bad. She loses game every time, and he even can’t understand it.
	"Wait a minute." Dan William stops. He looks at Ryan Jack who sits there silently, “Let he do it."
	Seeing that Dan William looks at him, Ryan Jack, who sits in the corner with a glass of red wine, looks back at them, and then he smiles.
	"Ryan, you are here too. Come and play cards with us." Jamie Moore doesn’t know Ryan Jack sits there, and it seems that he has been sit there for a long time. We can see this from the red wine in his hand.
	"OK." Ryan Jack smiles and nods. He would never refuse Jamie Moore's request.
	This is the battlefield of four men. Jamie Moore sits beside Dan William, and Duke Field, Bruce Hill and Ryan Jack sits opposite them. She thinks that Dan William has three enemies, thus Dan William and her will lose money badly.
	But something amazing happened!
	Jamie Moore looks at the card in Dan William’s hand in surprise. It seems that the card is the same, but Dan William could win every time, thus she feels unfair!
	Why?
	The card is the same, why Dan William could win? And she will lose the game every time. If someone wins game every time, she is person who will lose every time...
	Why does Dan William win game every time? This is to tell her that if she continues to gamble in the future, will she lose everything?
	The chips are getting bigger and bigger. Seeing the gold card of Duke Field, Bruce Hill and Ryan Jack are all in Dan William’s hand, Jamie Moore swallows her saliva. Dan William is so great. If she can win game once, she will be crazy.
	What about your backbone, Jamie Moore?
	Miss Moore proudly raises her eyebrows and shakes her hair.
	Ryan Jack and Duke Field is calm when compares with Bruce Hill. Seeing that Dan William wins every time, they just hands the card to him, and then they continue to play card.
	Bruce Hill pushes the last card in his wallet to Dan William with a bitter face, and then he pushes the card on the table, and then he says, “No, no, I will lose the whole Hill family."
	Therefore, if you cherish life, you should stay away from gambling, especially gambling with Dan William.
	"Oh? Can't afford to lose like this?” Dan William raises eyebrows, and then he pushes the gold card in front of him to Jamie Moore, "Take it well."
	Money!
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become bright, and she resists the desire to put these things into her pocket and says, "Give it to me?"
	"Who told you that? I just ask you to hold it.” Dan William turns away. He will never admit the reason that he gets so much money from them is to make up for the loss of Jamie Moore just now.
	"Now money is in my hand, do you expect to take it back?" Jamie Moore glances at Dan William, and then she shakes head to him as if Dan William is an incurable patient. Then she takes the money out of the wallet and put it into her own wallet. By the way, she puts the gold cards in the mezzanine of the wallet. It's like a small money fan.
	The flat wallet suddenly become full, which make Jamie Moore has a good mood.
	Ryan Jack’s eyes become dark. Do they have such a close relationship with each other?”
	"The music is on, brother. Having dance with Jamie Moore right now. It's waiting for you to start the party." Bruce Hill signs as soon as he hears the music. Tonight, Dan William should choose a dance partner to start the party. Otherwise, they would never leave today.
	He loves Jamie Moore so much. He really gets so much money from his brothers. Thus they should leave now.
	Dan William stands up slowly. Seeing that Jamie Moore is still staring at the wallet with a silly smile, he is a little helpless. He holds her wrist and takes her to the middle of the dance floor.
	The light is getting dark. If you look carefully, you can see that there are no paparazzi of those small companies on the scene except for the reporters of several regular entertainment companies. All of this is done by Derek William.
Chapter 134 Can I Have a Dance with You?
	Duke Field also stands up and then he shows his hand to Wendy gently. "Can I have a dance with you?"
	"Well." Wendy suppresses the excitement in her heart, and then she puts her hand on Duke Field’s hand calmly, and then she enters the dance floor with Duke Field.
	"Hello hello, what do I do when you're all gone?" Seeing that only he and Ryan Jack, Bruce Hill says. What’s more, Dan William doesn’t allow him to go to the party with other woman, thus he comes here alone. Now no one accompanies him, thus he is very lonely.
	Thinking of here, Bruce Hill looks at Ryan Jack who stands beside him. How about stay with him?
	Bruce Hill almost wants to slap himself when he realizes his thinking. What’s the thinking? Even though he lacks woman, he can’t stay with a man!
	Bruce Hill stands up angrily. He doesn't believe it. He is so handsome. Can’t he find a beautiful woman?
	Suddenly, he sees a familiar figure. Thus he walks to that figure happily.
	They form a circle with Dan William and Jamie Moore. Dan William and Jamie Moore dances in the circle. They cooperate with each other seamlessly, which is amazing.
	But it is true that if the tacit understanding is not high, it is impossible to give such a complete and amazing dance.
	The white dress of Jamie Moore and the black suit of Dan William complement each other. The white skirt ripples with layers of wavy patterns with each turn of Jamie Moore. The black and white interweaves with music, and it’s very beautiful.
	After finishing the dance, Jamie Moore lets go of her hands on Dan William’s shoulders, and then she finds that her palms has exuded sweat. Although they has cooperated with each other perfectly, she could not help being nervous.
	When the start dancing is over, it’s time for free dance. As soon as Jamie Moore lets her hand go, Dan William is circled by a group of women. Jamie Moore almost falls down due to the crowd.
	Jamie Moore tries all her efforts to stand still. Then she looks back, and then she finds a group of people stays with Dan William, and they are taking around Dan William happily. But they dare not to stay with Dan William too close, thus they scream excitedly half a meter away from Dan William.
	Dan William is very calm. He just stands there, and he looks very noble and elegant. Your heart will keep jumping if you keeps stare at him.
	The picture is very joyful, and it just likes a group of puppies around the owner. You want to stay close with one, but you should be careful.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and then she walks to the rest room as she wipes her hands.
	“There are so many women. If you have the ability, you can play with all of them.”
	Jamie Moore goes back to the corner of the rest place, where Ryan Jack sits. He puts his elbows on his thighs, and he puts two fingers on his chin, and his eyes are very warm, but no one knows his thinking.
	"What are you thinking?" Jamie Moore walks to Ryan Jack with a glass of champagne in her hand. She sits beside Ryan Jack, and now they sit very close with each other. Jamie Moore doesn’t think too much, but Ryan Jack’s heart jumps heavily.
	He touches his back neck uneasily. It’s not the first time for him to sit so close to Jamie Moore, but this time his heart beats heavily.
	He always sees Jamie Moore in a white shirt, jeans and leather shoes. She always has her hair in a ponytail or a ponytail, and she will carry a small leather bag of the same style as Ian Moore. When he looks at her from afar, he could feel how youthful she is. She is young and beautiful, which makes him comfortable from the bottom of his heart.
	As soon as she smiles, she shows two pear vortexes, which is sweet and soft.
	In his mind, this is the beautiful Jamie Moore.
	"Miss you." Ryan Jack narrows his eyes and hides the emotions in his eyes.
	"That's my pleasure." Jamie Moore grins. He could see a red dot on the white face of her. Although she has covered the red dot on her face with concealer, it still could be seen.
	"Are you still allergic?" Ryan Jack touches Jamie Moore’s face intimately. He could see the red dot on her face clearly and there is a touch of complexity and heartache in his eyes.
	Jamie Moore looks at the arms, and she has covered the red dot with concealer, but there is still some red dot on her arms. She doesn’t think that Ryan Jack will find this suddenly.
	"Yes, it still need at least two weeks! I won't touch perfume anymore. Jamie Moore frowns and rubs her arms lightly. She is so unlucky.
	If she has finished the design of the perfume clothes, she will throw those perfumes into the sea.
	Perfume is the nightmare for her. In the nightmare, she sees the big devil-Dan William forces her to give her a powder every day!
	"How about the perfume I send you? Will you allergic about it?" Ryan Jack asks with a frown.
	"It’s so strange. They are all perfumes, but I show no action to the perfume you send me. Why? Jamie Moore says in a puzzle. Because the R & D room is full of the smell of perfume, but the smell of a bottle of perfume would be lighter, so it didn't make her allergic, is she right?
	"Maybe this perfume is specially made for woman's skin in C country, so you don't allergic to it." Ryan Jack presses his lips tightly. He feels very guilt about her.
	He understands the reason why she is allergic.
	"Really?" Jamie Moore wrinkles her nose, and she looks very clever now. Even though this is true, she will never touch those things again.
	She looks at the red dot on her arms and then she touches it.
	"Come on, let's go dancing." Ryan Jack stands up, and then he reaches out to her gently. Then he says with a smile.
	"Well." Jamie Moore prepares to give her hand to Ryan Jack, but she is hold by another man.
	"She's my partner tonight." Dan William says in a low voice, and his voice is full of a strong sense of hegemony and possessiveness. He hold Jamie Moore’s waist tightly, and then says to Ryan Jack defiantly.
	Ryan Jack withdraws his hands, and now he is a little angry. He holds the right hand of Jamie Moore, "So what? This should be decided by Jamie Moore. Will Dan William make trouble with Jamie Moore?”
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore after hearing this. He could obviously feel the rigidity of her body. He puts his chin on Jamie Moore’s head, and says, “Jamie Moore, do I make trouble with you?”
	He holds Jamie Moore’s waist tightly as he says, and it seems that he is threatening her. But in the eyes of outsiders, they love each other.
	Jamie Moore only wants to beat the man in front of her!
	Does Dan William want to threaten her?
	"You're not making trouble with me." Jamie Moore says slowly with an expressionless face under Dan William triumphant eyes, "You're forcing a good woman to be a prostitute..."
	Dan William’s face becomes dark suddenly. Then he stares at the face of Jamie Moore, and his eyes are very oppressive.
	Ryan Jack smiles, and then he pulls Jamie Moore to his side. He looks very proud, “Mr. William, Jamie Moore doesn’t want to be your partner, so please let Jamie Moore go now."
Chapter 135 Can They be More Childish
	If Dan William lets Jamie Moore go, is he still Dan William?
	Mr. William looks up and then he frowns. Then he says in a domineering way, "No way."
	The atmosphere suddenly changes. Fortunately, it’s in the corner, thus other people will not notice here. Otherwise, the headlines of tomorrow will probably become the resentment of Jamie Moore.
	Seeing two men holding her hand, Jamie Moore rolls her eyes. It’s just like that two children are fight for the candies.
	Can they be more childish?
	"Mr. Jack would better let Jamie Moore go first." Dan William presses his lips, and his eyes are full of threat. He looks at Ryan Jack, and the atmosphere around him is very cold.
	"Oh? Why?" Although Ryan Jack holds Jamie Moore’s hand, but he holds her lightly. His voice is full of cold, and he says in a rhetorical and satire way. Jamie Moore never sees Ryan Jack in such a way.
	"Because I am the father of her son." Dan William says firmly. He doesn’t worry that other people will hear their words, thus he says in a proud way. He looks very confident.
	"As long as she doesn’t marry you, I will have a chance. Besides, I'm Ian Moore's godfather. I spend more time with him than you do."
	Indeed, this is the most capital place for Ryan Jack. Jamie Moore seen him as her best friend, and Ian Moore likes him more. If Dan William doesn't find Ian Moore, it's possible...
	However, Dan William snorts, “So what?”
	He has a close relationship with Ian Moore. So Dan William doesn’t worry about that.
	"What are you doing? Ian Moore is not a commodity. How could you define the value of my son like a commodity?" Jamie Moore is a little dissatisfied when she hears their words. How could they take Ian Moore as commodity? What’s the matter?
	They are so childish.
	She doesn’t want to hear anymore!
	Do they fight for her son? It's disgraceful for her to say it!
	"I need to go to the toilet. You two could fight with each other, but this is none of my business..." Jamie Moore gets rid of them. Thus she turns around and runs away quickly, and she soon disappears in the sight.
	"You are not the right man for her." Ryan Jack sits down, and then looks at Dan William and says.
	That's because Ryan Jack finds that Dan William always looks at Jamie Moore in a domineering and possessive way. And he doesn’t show any love in his eyes. The reason he gets angry is that Jamie Moore stays too close with him. He feels that his things has been grabbed by other people, thus he says such words.
	Dan William has everything. But if he can’t give happiness to Jamie Moore, he will do everything to let Jamie Moore stay with him.
	"So are you the right man for Jamie Moore?" Dan William doesn’t care the words from Ryan Jack. He clicks on the sofa, and he lowers his head.
	“……” Ryan Jack presses his lips bitterly.
	He loves Jamie Moore, but he is not the right man for Jamie Moore.
	Because Jamie Moore only takes him as brother.
	"Ha ha, you don't like her so much, do you?" Dan William looks at Ryan Jack in a meaningful way. He stands up and then he walks to the revolving stairs.
	Ryan Jack smiles. He snorts at Dan William’s words. If he doesn’t love her so much, he will not meet her here.
	So all chance is made by man.
	As soon as Jamie Moore wants to get out of the bathroom, she hears something outside. It sounds like noise, and she is familiar with that voice.
	"Since you can’t drink, why do you drink so much? If you dare to spit on my body, can you believe that I will kill you?" Bruce Hill’s voice come from the outside, and his voice are full of anger and helplessness.
	"What do you know? I haven't been drunk since I was a child. Do you know that I have a nickname of "wine jar" Anna Pork’s voice is full of hoarseness and vagueness. The voice of high-heeled shoes is a bit messy, and it seems that she has loss herself.
	Jamie Moore looks around, and then she smiles. Bruce Hill and Anna Pork? When do they stay so close with each other? It’s really a big news.
	"You? If you can't drink too much, you should stop drinking. You are just a little monster, and you should not pretend to be Altman. You are just a transformer galaxy force...Ah!" Anna Pork slaps Bruce Hill before Bruce Hill finishes his words.
	"Bullshit! I need to vomit!" Anna Pork withdraws her hands in a daze way. Her body is shaking and she would fall down from time to time. Fortunately, there is a man beside her. Otherwise, she will fall down on the ground.
	Bruce Hill stares at Anna Pork. However, Anna Pork is not awake at all. Thus Bruce Hill can only smash his teeth and keeps the words in his heart. He helps Anna Pork enter into the toilet sadly.
	He is Mr. Hill. He has been to everywhere except the woman's toilet. He never expects that he will enter the woman's toilet one day.
	Jamie Moore opens the door and walks out after hearing the sound of the next room. She walks to the hand washing table to wash her hands and runs out.
	Although it’s a good play, it’s not good to watch in the toilet. She should watch it in public.
	"Are you OK now?" Bruce Hill pats on Anna Pork’s back as he looks outside. He looks impatient.
	Anna Pork doesn’t care what Bruce Hill says. He vomits as if he wants to vomit all the things in her stomach.
	A rustle of footsteps sounds from the outside. Hearing voice, Bruce Hill jumps into the compartment, and then he closes the door.
	Then he hears several female voices coming from outside. He claps his chest. It’s so lucky.
	If this scene is seen by others, maybe tomorrow's headline is that "Mr. Hill runs into the ladies' bathroom to meet the mysterious woman."
	The compartment is small. Anna Pork is thin and small. It's nothing for her to stay there alone. But when Bruce Hill stays in the compartment with her, the space is narrow. They are so close with each other, as if they can feel the temperature on each body.
	Anna Pork drinks too much, thus her face is very red. Now she is very quiet. It seems that she is kind and smart. She looks at Bruce Hill with his big eyes.
	Her body is still swaying from side to side because she drinks too much. At last, she could only rely on the door panel to stabilize her body.
	Bruce Hill is a little surprised. Now this woman is very quiet, and she looks more lovely than usual. Now she looks like a woman.
	When he stays close with her, he even could smell the faint fragrance of flowers on her.
	The smell is different. He never smells this kind of fragrance on his girlfriend before.
	"What do you want to do?" Anna Pork is still drunk. Seeing that Bruce Hill walks close to her, he retreats subconsciously. But what behind her is the doorplate, which makes her unable to retreat.
	
Chapter 136 Slap
	"Stop there." Bruce Hill doesn’t know what’s wrong with him. He holds Anna Pork’s hands and then smells with his nose. His eyes become bright. This is the smell. There is no trace of perfume, and it seems to be the odor of body.
	Anna Pork smiles, and then she bends her knees sharply to kick the lower body of Dan William.
	Anna Pork smiles, and then she bends her knees sharply to kick the lower body of Dan William.
	"Ah!" Bruce Hill doesn’t know what Anna will do. Thus he is so pain and he bends down.
	This madwoman, where does she kick?
	"What’s the sound?"
	The voice of women comes from the door.
	At this time, Bruce Hill realizes that he is still in the woman’s bathroom. Thus he covers his mouth quickly and stops scream.
	Bruce Field feels very pain, and he almost doubts the life. He almost wants to kill Anna Pork!
	"Dead pervert, you have say love to a pillar. Why do you still want to do something bad to me? Hum." Anna Pork has lost her mind, but she still could feel the actions did by the people in front of her.
	Does he want to do something bad to her? Does he want to die?
	"Is there any sound? Did you hear it wrong?"
	"Really? Let's go."
	Bruce Hill covers Anna Pork’s month hardly. He looses his hand as long as the woman outside leaves. He holds Anna Pork’s neck and says angrily, “You are a dead woman. I take you to here. How could you treat me like this?”
	Anna Pork has lost her mind, and she doesn’t know the words of Bruce Hill. She just smiles. If she is awake, she will hold Bruce Hill’s beck back immediately. Seeing that Anna Pork is so quiet, Bruce Hill losses the interest to argue with Anna.
	Bruce Hill glares at her fiercely, "It’s true that you drink too much, but don't except that you could do everything to me! If you dare to do this to me, I will kill you today!"
	He puts Anna Pork on his shoulder as he says. And then he takes out a mobile phone to dial a phone .
	"Hello? Brother, I have something to do now, so I'll go back first. You can play. Don't worry about me..."
	Jamie Moore wanders aimlessly in the William Family after she goes out of the bathroom. After so many years, everything at here is the same as before.
	Jamie Moore goes to the courtyard, and then she looks at the dark villa of the Moore Family. The whole house is dark. Compared with the William Family, the Moore Family is quieter.
	It's said that Jack Moore also receives the invitation letter, but he doesn’t find her daughter. If he still comes to the party, he is really not a man.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips coldly. Her eyes are full of light, but her face doesn’t have any expression. She walks forward quietly.
	After walking for a while, Jamie Moore has come to the door of the William Family. After thinking for a while, she opens the door and walks out.
	The next house is the Moore Family.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she picks up the skirt and walks slowly to the Moore Family. It’s very close, so she walks to the door of the Moore Family within a few minutes.
	The door is locked and there is no light in it.
	Jamie Moore looks the garden by the light from the William's house. It has been repaired as before, but it is still the style of Celina Swift and Mia Moore, which is gorgeous and splendid.
	She has so many memories with her mother here. But how could the place changes in such a way?
	Jamie Moore puts her little hand on the cold black iron door. The cold wind blows up her skirt. The white skirt is blooming in the night, but it’s not abrupt at all. It’s dazzling and beautiful like a flower.
	Squeak————
	A loud and sharp brake sound and then two lights are shining on Jamie Moore, which is very dazzling.
	Then two people get off the car. The lights are so dazzling that Jamie Moore could only block the light with her fingers and sees two people from the cracks of her fingers
	A person who gets off the car never expects that they will see Jamie Moore here. Thus one people among them is very excited. She walks to Jamie Moore angrily.
	"Bitch! You still have the face to come here!" Then she slaps Jamie Moore heavily, which surprises Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore feels very pain on her left face. She gets her mind after dazzling for a while.
	She looks at the people in front of her.
	It’s Celina Swift.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and she could feel the pain on her face. Celina Swift must slap her with all her strength.
	Her lips are broken by that slap, and there is blood on her lips. It’s impossible that she is not pain.
	"Bitch! I will kill you today!" Celina Swift is very angry, and she still wants to slap Jamie Moore.
	Does she want to slap her one more time?
	Jamie Moore gets angry. Just now, she doesn’t notice Celina Swift, thus she is slapped by her. But now, does she want to slap her one more time?
	Does she want to die?
	"Hiss - ah!" Jamie Moore holds Celina Swift’s hand in the air, and then she bends Celina Swift’s hand back vigorously.
	It’s Dan William who teaches her judo. Even if she is stupid, she knows how to write resist.
	What's more, Jamie Moore is a woman who remembers the past.
	"Bitch, bitch stop now--" Celina Swift's face is pale with pain. It seems that her hand had broken. Thus she bends down to relieve the pain.
	"Just now, you slap me. Why don’t you stop just now? Do you think I'm a bully or do you think you have the capital to fight with me?” Jamie Moore raises her eyebrow and says. She holds Celina Swift’s hand easily. The relaxed expression of her is far from expression of Celina Swift.
	"Stop now! Jamie Moore, let her go." Jack Moore's loud voice rings from behind Celina Swift.
	Jamie Moore looks coldly at Jack Moore. Stop now? Why doesn’t he stop Celina Swift when Celina Swift slaps her?
	Is the fact that the Moore Family could bully her, but she can’t bully them?
	"Do you hear me? I ask you to let her go!" Jack Moore says in an angry voice. He kicks the ground with the crutches in his hands, and he looks very angry.
	"Why?" Jamie Moore looks at Jack Moore angrily. She holds Celina Swift’s hand tightly, thus Celina Swift screams loudly.
	Jack Moore is so angry, thus he raises his crutch and slap it hard at Jamie Moore.
	The crutch hits on the shoulder of Jamie Moore in a muffled sound.
	It’s too terrible
	Jamie Moore’s face turns pale, thus she looses her hand. She covers her shoulder and takes a few step back.
	As long as she moves her shoulder, she will feel very pain. It seems that the bone has broken. It's hard for her to move even once.
	This is more serious when compares with the slap given by Celina Swift.
	Jamie Moore almost screams due to the pain on her shoulder. She could just bite her tip of her tongue tightly with her teeth, so that she would not cry out so heartlessly.
	It’s true that she feels very pain. But she will never allow herself to show any embarrassment in front of the two people she hates most.
	
Chapter137 How Dare you to Beat her?
	Celina Swift walks to Jack Moore. She holds her broken hand with another hand. She feels very pain and she says, “Younger master, you should help me!”
	"Hum!" Jack Moore doesn’t care about Jamie Moore when he sees Jamie is very pain. He shakes off Celina Swift’s hand badly, and then he walks to Jamie Moore, “You are stubborn. Do you think you are hard than the crutch in my hand?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She is so pain that her forehead is full of sweat. She looks at Jack More who stands in front of her, “If you have the ability, you could kill me.”
	"You!" Jack Moore's shrewd eyes are full of hatred and complexity.
	"I want to see if the life of you crutch is longer than my life." Jamie Moore endures the sharp pain from her shoulder. She stands straightly, and then she looks at Jack Moore. She shows an unyielding arrogance from his bones.
	They look so alike with each other!
	Jack Moore trembles his eyes, and his eyes turns from complexity to hatred. Jamie Moore in front of him seems to overlap with the shadow of Adele Gilbert. He holds his crutch once, and he wants to slap Jamie Moore again.
	Kill her! Kill her! This is the only idea in Jack Moore’s mind.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes. The most terrible thing is that she will enter the hospital again. If she dies for this, she will never let him go!
	But she doesn’t feel any pain. Jamie Moore opens her eyes slowly, and then she hears an angry voice, “How dare you to beat her?”
	Jamie Moore narrows her eye. And she looks at Dan William who holds her in his arms. Dan William holds the crutch of Jack Moore tightly with is right hand. Seeing this, Jamie Moore feels very warm.
	"Who gave you the courage to beat her?" Dan William releases the crutch in his hand. He did it in a big strength, thus Jack Moore takes a few steps back.
	Jack Moore looks very bad. It seems that he never expects that Dan William will appear suddenly. Thus he withdraws his hand unhappily, “Mr. William, you misunderstand me. I am just educating my daughter."
	"Educating?" Dan William looks at him coldly. How long he knows Jamie Moore, how long he knows Jack Moore. Jack Moore doesn’t like Jamie Moore. But he seldom sees Jack Moore beats Jamie Moore in such a way.”
	Originally, he thinks Jack Moore loves Mia Moore more, thus he ignores Jamie Moore. But now it seems that this is not true.
	Jack Moore wants to kill Jamie Moore right now.
	Mia Moore is his daughter, but Jamie Moore is also his daughter. It's a big difference.
	Dan William has some pity on Jamie Moore. She would not be happy to have such a father.
	But in fact, Jamie Moore doesn’t care about this. Because she doesn’t have any relationship with Jack Moore. So she will not be unhappy.
	"Then the way you educate your daughter is really unique. People who don't know this may think that Jamie is not your daughter." Dan William glances at Celina Swift, who is hiding behind Jack Moore, and then he looks back at Jack Moore. His eyes are cold and sharp, which makes people dare not look at him directly.
	Mr. William, you are right. I am not his daughter.
	Jack Moore is embarrassed. But he is afraid of the identity of Dan William. Thus he just hears silently.
	But since he has done such thing to Jamie Moore, will Jamie Moore let him go?
	"I heard that the Moore Family is bidding for a cooperation case recently." Dan William turns around and says casually.
	He holds Jamie Moore’s hand with his long fingers. Jamie Moore’s left face is very red, but the right face is pale, which is a big contrast. The blood on her lips has been coagulated, and now she looks very embarrassed.
	The eyesight of Jamie Moore is very cold. He touches the corner of Jamie Moore’s hand with his fingers. He feels very pain in his heart.
	Even he is reluctant to beat her. How Jack Moore could beat her like this?
	Jack Moore suddenly becomes very nervous. The cooperation case is very important to the Moore Family. Is he...
	"If it isn’t for Jamie Moore, your broken company will disappear in country C tomorrow. Now, it's just a warning." Dan William says, and then he walks to the William Family with Jamie Moore in his arms.
	The crutch in Jack Moore’s hand falls on the ground violently, making a clear sound. Dan William always does everything he says. Will the Moore Family be destroyed in such a way?
	No, he can't. He has to find a way. The Moore Company is the only lifeline of his life. It can’t be destroyed!
	Not long before Dan William walks into the William Family with Jamie Moore, Ian Moore walks out of the dark with Night.1. The atmosphere around him is very cold. He looks at the Moore Family, and then he sneers.
	"Night.1." Ian Moore says in a cold way.
	"Young master."
	"I don't like here. What can I do?" Seeing that Jack Moore and Celina Swift sit in to the car, Ian Moore says. But if you look at him carefully, you will see the face of Ian Moore is very serious.
	"I see." Night.1 bows his head. He looks at the Moore Family, and then he calls Night.7. The phone is answered soon.
	...
	Instead of taking Jamie Moore back to the party, Dan William takes her to the garage. And then they drive to the villa.
	"Slow down, I'm in pain." Jamie Moore sits in the driver's seat, and her face is very pale. Dan William drives too quickly, thus Jamie Moore can’t bear it.
	"Who ask you to go to there? What are you going to do there? You know that they don’t like you. Do you want to be beat?” Dan William says angrily. He stares at the woman beside him, and then he slows down gradually.
	Jamie Moore moves the position painfully, and then she says. "If I know that I would meet them, I would not go to there."
	So, if you are unlucky, you can plug your teeth with cold water.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t expect that Jack Moore would be so cruel this time. He beats her so heavily. It’s lucky that she doesn’t shout out. Otherwise, she would lose her face.
	But Celina Swift is also not in a good way. She at least needs to have a rest for half a mouth, otherwise, she can’t move happily.
	She will all of this from Jack Moore one day!
	“……” Dan William doesn’t say anything. He glances at the right shoulder of Jamie Moore, and he is very angry now.
	It’s early in the morning when they return back to the manor. Dr. Slater is still sleeping. However, Dan William wakes him up with a call.
	Dan William's voice is full of hasty, which makes Dr. Slater dare not to delay for half a minute. He pushes away his wife in his arms. After changing his clothes and shoes, he rushes out of the door with the medicine box.
	He really doubts that if he goes on like this, he will automatically form a habit of going out on his own as soon as he receives the call from Dan William.
	Dr. Slater also lives in the manor, but he does not live in the villa where Dan William lives. Dan William arranges the residence for him specially. Even in such way, Dr. Slater arrives at the villa by the patrol car after five minutes.
	
Chapter138 Retribution
	"Young master, here I am." Dr. Slater runs to the second floor. And then he sees Dan William is waiting for him at the door. Thus he speeds up.
	It’s really a challenge for him.
	"Come in." As soon as Dan William sees Dr. Slater, his eyes become bright. He asks Dr. Slater enter into the room quickly. And then he takes Dr. Slater to Jamie Moore, who is sitting on the sofa.
	"She is injured in shoulder and face. You need to have a check quickly." Dan William puts Dr. Slater down, and then he says to him as he puts Jamie Moore’s hair to behind.
	"All right." Dr. Slater puts on his gold rimmed glasses quickly. He looks at the right face of Jamie Moore. It’s very red. And the corner of her lips is still broken. He thinks that the young master's woman is so strong, and she almost suffers problems every day.
	"Take some ice and put it on her face first, then put some medicine on her face and it will be ready tomorrow." Dr. Slater says Dan William, and then he prepares to pulls the belt of Jamie Moore’s dress down.
	"What are you doing?" Dan William narrows his eyes. He slaps the hand of Dr. Slater, and then he looks at him coldly.
	Dr. Slater withdraws his hand quickly, and then he says, "Young master, if you don't let me see it, how can you deal with it? I have no ability to see through it."
	Dan William snorts and blocks Dr. Slater's sight with his body. He pulls Jamie Moore’s belt down. Thus Dr. Slater could see the blue and purple skin of Jamie Moore’s body.
	Jack Moore beats her so heavily!
	Jamie Moore awkwardly shifts his eyes to other places. Dan William stares at her in such a way, thus she would be shy.
	Dan William gives the position to Dr. Slater, and he looks at Jamie Moore with a pitiful eyes.
	The Moore Family will not have a happy life.
	Dr. Slater looks at the injury in Jamie Moore’s shoulder. She reaches out to press her shoulder. Originally, Jamie Moore feels very pain, thus she dares not to move. Now Dr. Slater presses her shoulder, she feels more pain than before. Her face is pale, and she holds the sofa tightly.
	Dr. Slater nods thoughtfully, and then he says to Dan William, "Young master, the injury on young lady's shoulder is serious, and it can't be cured simply by smearing medicine. I suggest that you take her to the hospital to take a picture to see if the bone is broken."
	Is bone broken?
	It’s too terrible!
	Jamie Moore wants to lies down in such a way, but she can’t move, thus she rolls her eyes gloomily.
	"Is it so serious?" Dan William says in a low voice. Other people will be fright by this.
	"Yes, yes." Dr. Slater swallows and he dares not to look at him directly.
	Dan William doesn’t speak anything, and then he walks to Jamie Moore. He holds Jamie Moore in his arms tightly, and then he walks to outside.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t except that she has such a destiny with hospital. He just leaves hospital, and the red pot on her body is not recovered. But she comes to the hospital again.
	It’s too terrible!
	Jamie Moore sits in the chairs of the hallway of the hospital. Dan William is taking medicine for her, and she is waiting for him.
	But fortunately, the bone is OK. Although it looks a little scary, it’s OK as long as the bone is well.
	Jamie Moore looks at the light on his head, and then she presses her lips. She begins to count the squares on the ceiling.
	Dan William walks out when she counts the 26th piece. But there is nothing on Dan William’s hand.
	"Where is my medicine? Don't I have to be hospitalized?" Seeing that Dan William holds her in his arms, Jamie Moore asks. She is not hurt so bad, so she doesn’t need to wipe medicine.
	"We could use the medicine given by Dr. Slater. If you want to be in hospital, I'll go through the hospitalization formalities for you now." Dan William turns around as he says lightly.
	"No, no, no, I don't want to stay in hospital at all." Jamie Moore holds his hand quickly, but she feels more pain in her shoulder.
	Dan William presses his lips, and his eyes are full of smile. Then he walks out of the hospital with Jamie Moore in his arms.
	The light has drawn their shadows in a long way. Jamie Moore looks at Jamie Moore secretly. Her heart jumps heavily when she sees the beautiful chin of Dan William.
	...
	All the TV stations in country C are reporting on the incident last night.
	Last night, at about 3 a.m., there is a big explosion in the house of the Moore Family!
	The big explosion doesn't affect the surrounding houses, but the villa of the Moore Family is completely destroyed. It only leaves some garbage. No one is in the villa at that time, so no one is hurt in the explosion.
	A car parks at the gate of the villa of the Moore Family. And it doesn’t be affected. Jack and Celina Swift are sitting in that car. Now they have been taken to the hospital. The doctor is checking for them.
	"Tut Tut, what's this?" Jamie Moore sits on the bed, and she is watching TV.
	Last night, Jack Moore beats her. Now something bad happened to him. So everything is reincarnation, haha.
	Jamie Moore thinks happily in her heart.
	"Mommy, it's called retribution." Ian Moore looks from the door, and then he opens the door and walks in. His face is full of soft smile.
	"Come on baby." Jamie Moore waves to Ian Moore with a smile. Ian Moore runs to Jamie Moore happily. Then he sits next to Jamie Moore.
	"Ah, Mommy, you are hurt! Who did it?" Ian Moore knows that Jamie Moore is injured before. But if he doesn’t show any surprise about this, Jamie Moore will doubt this. If Jamie Moore knows that he has comes the party last night, she will beat him on the butt.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is injured, Ian Moore is still distressed.
	Jamie Moore snorts angrily. Seeing that the tragedy of the villa of Moore Family is still on TV, she says, "It's him, the one whose house was bombed."
	"They are so bad. How can they beat Mommy?" Ian Moore says angrily. His eyes are full of smile when he watches the TV, “But mommy, he beats you, and now his house is destroyed. It's retribution."
	Does other people bomb the house?
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes. Why doesn't she think of this?
	Last night, she is beat by him. And now the house of the Moore Family is bombed. Is this a coincidence? No one will believe this.
	If it's a coincidence, other house around it will also be destroyed. But now nothing around the Moore Family is destroyed.
	It’s so strange after thinking it carefully.
	Does Dan William do this?
	Seeing that Jamie Moore keeps thinking, Ian Moore feels frighten. Does mommy find something?
	"Mommy, what are you thinking?” Ian Moore stays close to Jamie Moore. He looks at Jamie Moore with his big eyes.
	After being disturbed by Ian Moore, Jamie Moore forgets what she thinks right now. But it is likely that Dan William did this thing.
	No one has such ability except Dan William.
	Thinking of here, Jamie Moore rubs the hair of Ian Moore. It couldn’t be done by her son.
	"Honey, I need Night.1 to do something for me. Please tell him."
Chapter 139 the Silly Woman
	Ian looks at her and blinks his eyes, "Mommy, why do you call Night.1 for doing something? Just let bunny help you."
	"You are too young and you can help when you grow up." Jamie gets close to Ian's ear and tells him that good thing.
	Ian nods while he is listening. After hearing that, he is speechless. It turns out that the good thing Mummy says is actually to ask Night.1 to research about how Jack and Celina are going with their hurt.
	Last night he saw how Night.1 blew up the Moore's house. Jack was in the car and was about to leave at that time. Ian concerns about the time exactly to let Night.1 detonate. If Jack was going back to the villa at that time, it was afraid now he is not as simple as being injured.
	Ian remembers Jamie's words to keep Jack's life. Otherwise, he won't let them leave just with the slap and an attack last night.
	"Well, what about your daddy?" Jamie looks up at the clock. It is just 1,00pm now. He should be at work.
	"Daddy is still on the phone, and he will be here in a while." When Ian comes, he hears something about the cooperation case. So he estimates that Dan will put his hand to the Moore.
	Jamie twitches her mouth and thinks that doesn't he go to work?
	It seems that Dan has seldom gone to the company recently. Won't CR go bankrupt in this way?
	"Oh mommy! An uncle asked bunny to give this to you." Ian suddenly remembers that when he left the Williams' house last night, a man wearing sunglasses gave him such a thing and asked him to pass it to Jamie.
	After passing things over to Ian, the man left.
	Ian is worried about something may be bad of this thing so he specially asks Night.7 to check it. But there has no problem.
	It is a bluelover.
	Jamie raises her eyebrows and is puzzled, looking at Ian, "Who gives it to me?"
	The bluelover is not the kinds of flower she likes. There are not many people she knows well here. She can't think of anyone who will give her flowers.
	Moreover, it is too strange that he sends only one.
	Even stranger, he asks Ian to pass it to her. How can that person know that Ian knows her?
	"I don't know, the uncle also let mommy take good care of you and he will come back again." Ian's soft and cute face shows the cold feeling. Moreover, the man clearly saw that they had blown up the Moores' house but he said nothing. Also he knows that he is Jamie's son.
	Then who is this person?
	"Well." Jamie nods and picks up the bluelover. She looks at it and then put it back in the box, letting Ian put it away casually.
	Ian takes the box and finds a place to place it. He is about to walk back to Jamie with his short legs, but his back collar is picked up by a big hand.
	"What's that?" Dan squeezes Ian's face and asks when he sees the box on the table.
	Ian bulges his face and looks at the box. Then he smiles slyly, "That's the flower that mummy's suitor sends to mummy. Daddy, your status is in crisis."
	"Who sends it?" Dan picks up the box and opens it. He looks at it with a chuckle, "Is there still anyone who will send flowers to? Throw it away."
	"Daddy, it's necessary to make the girl happy. Daddy hasn't sent flowers to Mommy, right?" Ian sees Dan's movement of throwing the box into the trash bin. Then he seems to think of something and widens his big eyes.
	As far as Ian knows, in addition to Ryan, there are many suitors who have sent flowers to his mommy. Every time mommy will sell those flowers, and then buy him a lot of small snacks.
	So Ian doesn't hate flowers at all.
	Dan's eyes blink and look at elsewhere. It seems he hasn’t.
	Ian looks at Dan's eyes and suddenly dislikes his attitude, "Daddy, you never give flowers to mommy. Then mommy may marry other men."
	"She won't become a promising people if she marries another man for some flowers." Dan says dismissively.
	But when he thinks about it. Jamie may act like this when she sees flowers and go with others.
	"Who can't become a promising people?" Jamie closes her eyes immediately when he comes in, pretending to be still sleeping. However, she opens her eyes as soon as Dan says that she can't become a promising people.
	What does he mean by saying that?
	"Mommy, Dad says you can't become a promising people!" Ian says unkindly, as if he is adding a barrel of oil to the fire.
	Dan's hand immediately pinch Ian's little ass. What a naughty boy. Does Ian still complain about him?
	"You just tell him that I'm much better than the arrogant man who wants to abduct me to register for marriage without a flower." Jamie glances at Dan in disbelief.
	Ian turns his head to look at Dan, blinking for a few times. He does not know whether to convey her words.
	Dan put Ian down, and Ian immediately walks over Dan and runs out of the door with short legs.
	He intends to close the door but turns a corner when he suddenly thinks of something. He sees from outside the door, and looks at Dan. "Daddy, Mommy doesn't recover, so you should be careful if you hit her ass."
	He closes the door immediately after saying that.
	Bad boy. The traitor!
	Jamie feels puzzled. He doesn't help his mummy but still let the devil hit her carefully?!
	It may not be worthy of raising him!
	Dan smiles in a good mood his hands fall in his pocket. He walks to the opposite table and opens the drawer. He takes out the medicine.
	"What do you want to do? Do you want to poison me?" Jamie sees that he doesn't do it. Instead, he takes the medicine out. She almost scares to jump up.
	Finally, her shoulders hit the wall and she feels painful.
	"If you don't want to fell painful, you can just sit well and don't move." Dan frowns and hits her smooth forehead with his hand.
	He has never seen such a silly woman who knows that the pain but still acts like a monkey. Doesn't she feel painful enough?
	"What are you going to do?" Jamie doesn't dare to move anymore, wrinkling her small face. She thinks that when she gets better, she is going to kill him although she can't win.
	Anyway, her teeth are sharp.
	"Use the potion." Dan takes out a bottle of potion. It is a transparent liquid like Jamie's allergy potion before. He thinks that Jim really understands women' mind. The transparent color is better than those colorful one.
	But the allergy is not cured and she hurts again. Jamie feels she is extremely unlucky.
	But in fact, this potion is specially prepared by Dan who just wants to make the wound look better.
	
Chapter 140 Dan, I'm back!
	Taking out a few swabs, Dan sits on the edge of the bed and stays a little closer to Jamie. He is about to pull Jamie's cloths on her shoulders.
	"Wait, I can do it by myself." Jamie immediately covers her clothes. Her voice is sweet, with a hint of shyness.
	She looks at Dan who is waiting for her to take off and does not have any obscene sights, thinking that she really thinks too much. The big boss can never be the kind of person who takes advantage of her perilous state.
	In fact, Miss Moore, your trust is wrong.
	Dan is the one who will take advantage of her perilous state, but he is not obvious.
	This evil man knows how to adopt a long-term plan to secure something. It is not yet time. When the time comes, you will be caught directly and even have no time to run away.
	Jamie turns her face aside and doesn't look at Dan’s handsome face. Her heart is beating like a drum, which makes her at a loss.
	Her resistance can make her resist any temptation of any handsome man. But for Dan, she can't help it.
	"Dan." Jamie says suddenly, turning her face to look at Dan. Her eyes are shining, as if she intends to say something.
	"What?" He answers, raising his eyebrows to look at her, with a low voice. And his current appearance is charming enough.
	Jamie's face turns red and she purses her pink lips. She looks so cute now, "You press my leg and I cannot feel my legs..."
	Dan's hand which is holding a cotton swab shivers and his eyebrows raise for a few times. He shouldn't expect her to say something in line with the atmosphere!
	Jamie blinks and looks at Dan, who stands up with a bad expression. Does she say something wrong?
	"Do you do anything to my family?" Jamie asks when she manages the clothes on her shoulders and pounds her numb thighs.
	Dan's eyes flashes slightly, and he throws the cotton swab into the trash. "No."
	Actually doesn’t he do that?
	Jamie twitches her lips, and she can't think of anyone else who will do it except Dan.
	But Dan can't possibly lie. Who blow up the Moores’ house?
	Is it really a coincidence?
	Jamie is recovering for a week before it has some obvious effects. Although it still hurts, it was much better than feeling painful for a long time than before when she just moves a little.
	Fortunately, the previous design draft has already prepared. As long as it is processed, it can be completed.
	Although it goes well, Jamie hurts her right shoulder. If she wants to grab the pen with her right hand, she still feels it difficult to manage.
	Splat.
	Jamie sits on the deck chair on the balcony, looking at the pencil that she hasn't known how many times it fell. And she has no interest in picking it up.
	With one week left before the deadline given by Moon, Jamie knows that she may not be able to recover even in two weeks.
	However, she is not willing to let go of this opportunity. She is still very confident about the set of clothing of perfume.
	With a sigh, Jamie bends down and picks up the pen with her left hand, looking at the curved lines on the drawing board obediently.
	On the downstairs.
	A figure comes out of the red Ferrari and looks up at the villa in front.
	"Amelia." Cindy freezes in surprise when she sees Amelia and then she quickly greets her.
	Amelia holds a pair of sunglasses in her hand and carries a small leather bag of the same brand. Then she embraces Cindy cordially.
	"Why will you come to here?" Cindy hugs Amelia and guides her into the villa.
	When Amelia went to Italy, it was not long after Jamie left. The manor was also built after Jamie left. It stands to reason that Amelia should not know where the manor is.
	"I called Dan and he tells me to come here." Amelia walks back and forth in the lobby a few times and looks around. She seems to like here.
	"Okay, Amelia. You can take a seat first. I'll prepare some juice for you." Cindy says with a smile and turns away.
	"Thank you, Cindy." Amelia sticks her tongue out naughtily. Then she walks on the spiral staircase to the second floor.
	She doesn't know which room is Dan’s.
	Amelia shakes her sunglasses on her hand. Then she opens a room on the second floor and walks inside.
	"Here must be his room!" Amelia knows it when she sees the layout here. It must be Dan's bedroom because the layout here is exactly the same as his bedroom in their house.
	Amelia walks inside and smiles happily. She looks around, and then sees someone seems to lie on the deck chair in the balcony.
	It must be Dan!
	When this mind is settled, Amelia comes to the balcony and shouts in a sweet voice, "Dan, I'm back!"
	Jamie, who is confused, is frightened by the sound and she turns to around to see her.
	She is Amelia. Although she has seen her when she was a child, she can recognize her.
	She doesn't expect that she has returned to China for so long, but she just meets her today.
	Amelia widens her eyes in surprise, staring at Jamie in disbelief. She recognizes her as well.
	"I haven't seen you for a long time, Amelia." Jamie's lips twitch slightly and her eyes are calmly looking at her.
	"You. Why are you here?!" Amelia regains her mind and walks to Jamie, looking at her with surprise and panic.
	"Is this the place where you can come? Why do you always haunt my brother?" Amelia's expression is slightly weird when she stares at Jamie and becomes mad uncontrollably.
	"Oops." Jamie can't help sneering. Is she haunting Dan? Will she bother him when she wishes to escape from him? Are the people of the Williams born with a sense of superiority? Why do they think everyone would like to approach them for some purpose?
	However, these noble and elegant people are actually crueler than anyone.
	"What are you laughing at?" Amelia raises her chin proudly and looks at her contemptuously.
	"Whether I bother your brother, you should ask him! As long as he let me leave, I will definitely leave here immediately." Jamie can already imagine that Amelia is more surprised when she sees Ian.
	
Chapter 141 Don’t be Shameless to Stay Here
	"That's what you say! Don’t be shameless to stay here!" Amelia snorts at her and turns away after she gets the result she wants.
	Jamie lowers her eyes. It is hard to see the exciting emotions in her eyes. But it is not difficult to feel her cold breath.
	She considers that she can protect her heart and she will no longer suffer any harm. Unexpectedly, Dan is even better than her. “Jamie, it makes sense to judge that you are stupid.”
	It doesn't know how long it takes before Jamie slowly lifts her eyes. It is already at evening. She rubs her eyes and put the drawing board on the deck chair. Then she plans to go downstairs.
	"Dan, have you missed me when I haven't been in these years?" Amelia holds Dan's shoulder intimately, acting like a child.
	"How can’t I miss you? You are my only sister." Dan reaches out and tickles her nose, answering gently.
	Most of Dan's love is given to Jamie, but he is also very fond of his only sister. He will agree with any request of Amelia.
	"Well, you are so good to me." Amelia smiles proudly. She thinks that it will be much easier to drive that woman away.
	Jamie rubs her eyes and goes downstairs, seeing that Amelia and Dan's intimate appearance. She doesn't know what they are talking about. But her small face looks pale and she doesn't look well.
	Dan sees Jamie coming down and his sights stops on her pale face. Then his eyebrows frowns "Are you uncomfortable?"
	Amelia is pleased secretly, knowing that she is pretending to be pitiful because she will be driven away in a while. Don't think that she will be merciful!
	"I’m okay." Jamie walks over and selects a seat farther away from them.
	Dan finds that she seems to sit so far away from him deliberately, and her eyes are filled with displeasure. She looks at her pale face but couldn't help feeling distressed. So he is a little irritable. "Why do you sit so far away from me?
	"No, I just sit here." Jamie looks at the food in her plate without looking up. She doesn’t have any appetite.
	What a horrible thing it is for foodies. She looks at all the food on the table but still has no appetite.
	But Jamie does have no appetite!
	"You are so impolite that you act at your will in others’ home." Amelia glances at her disdainfully. Then she turns to Dan and says indulgently, "Dan, I hate her. Will you kick her out?"
	It doesn’t happen recently that Amelia hates Jamie although they play together in their childhood and they get along well with each other.
	However, she doesn't know when Amelia starts to have something against Jamie. And Jamie is not a weak doormat. Even when she faces Dan, she dares to fight with Amelia.
	Over time, Dan feels that it is just a little scarp and Amelia is quite childish.
	But after such a long time, even Dan almost forgets that Amelia used to haunt Jamie when she called her "Jamie". He can't remember how good the relationship between them is before.
	"Amelia, don't be childish." Dan replies helplessly. Amelia dislikes Jamie, which is a big problem.
	Amelia immediately pursed her mouth in grievance, watching at Dan with a complaint, "I’m not childish. I just dislike her!"
	Jamie looks at the food in front of her quietly. She takes the juice on the table and drinks slowly.
	"If you don't want to drive her out, I'll leave here!" Knowing that Dan isn’t moved, Amelia finally throws his hands away angrily and stands up. Moreover, she glances at Jamie hatefully.
	Dan's eyebrows are frowned, and he looks inadvertently at Jamie's direction. But he sees her indifferent look, and there is no refute to Amelia's words. She is much quieter than her excited behaviors in normal days.
	But this kind of quietness makes Dan feel uncomfortable for no reason.
	It's as if he will soon lose her completely.
	"That's fine. You can go back home and live there. I will let Cindy take care of you." Dan says peacefully after considering for a moment.
	What?
	Amelia looks at Dan incredulously, and then looks at Jamie again. Her brother actually let her go because of this woman?
	She doesn't understand how Jamie makes her brother obsessed with her!
	"Dan~" Amelia walks over to grab Dan's arm, shaking his arm coquettishly.
	"Jamie absolutely doesn’t leave here. If you don't like her, you can go back to your home." Dan knows his sister's temperament, but he still chooses to support Jamie.
	Jamie raises her head to look at Dan who is sitting opposite her in amazement. His expression is serious that he isn’t kidding.
	But this makes Jamie uncomfortable in her mind and she has some mixed feelings.
	He actually refuses her only sister's request for her.
	"Dan! She's not my sister-in-law. Why will you help her so kindly? Who is your dearest person?" Amelia refuses to agree with him. She grabs Dan's arm with her mouth cursed while she stares at Jamie fiercely.
	The woman should be to blame. Otherwise why will his brother think of driving her away?
	Jamie blinks innocently and she inexplicably feels a litter delighted. Looking at the food in front of her, she suddenly has a bit appetite. She picks up a knife and fork to take a few bites. Then she put it down again.
	It must be because Ian is not here tonight, so her appetite will be so bad.
	Ian calls back before and says that he is with Night.1. so he don’t come back tonight. Jamie trusts Night.1 so she leaves Ian alone.
	"Amelia, don't be childish." Dan's eyebrows are frowned. His black eyes flashes a feeling of frustration, but his sights are always on Jamie.
	In the past if Amelia acts so unreasonably, she had already refuted. But tonight, she does not even show any unhappy emotions.
	Is she too calm or really indifferent?
	Dan's black eyes are dark and deep, showing incomprehensible feelings. It looks like a turbulent vortex which is constantly surrounding Jamie.
	"Why am I childish?" Amelia stomps discontentedly and the grievance and anger appears in her beautiful eyes. "Don’t you care about me when our parents are not there?"
	"In this home, either she goes or I go! If she doesn't leave, I'll go now!" Amelia can't help increasing her volume. Then she takes her bag on the table and leaves angrily.

Chapter 142 You can Catch up with Her
	Jamie put down the crystal glass in her hand calmly, looking at Amelia whose back expresses her anger. She considers that if she can throw a torch on her and it may probably burn up.
	In fact when facing Amelia, Jamie is calm to the extreme. Except for the hatred when she first sees her, there is not much emotional fluctuation.
	She doesn't hate her anymore, but it is absolutely impossible to get along with her peacefully.
	She can take measures according to the actual situation. Moreover, she wants to see if Amelia's means will be as naive and brutal as before.
	However, she is no longer the coward Jamie.
	"I'm full." Jamie pushes the dish in front of her and stands up, looking at Dan calmly, "You can catch up with her."
	After finishing her words, she turns to go upstairs.
	Dan keeps silent for a while and finally raises his hand to rubs his tired eyebrows, "Derek."
	"Dan." Derek's black figure appears behind Dan like a ghost. He answers while he bows his head peacefully.
	"Follow Amelia. If she has any orders, you just have to obey."
	"Yes."
	There is no one behind and the servants in the villa are busy with their own matters.
	The chandelier above his head exudes a faint and soft light which falls on Dan's body, on his tired face. It adds a bit of lazy appearance on him.
	Amelia is totally against Jamie, which is a big problem.
	But for her sister, Dan is still very fond of her. In addition, their parents have indulged her since childhood. Since Amelia has grown up, she never suffers anything that can be called frustration.
	The only exception is Jamie.
	Amelia has such a strong family background and Dan, a brother who is famous in country C. therefore, it can be said that she is the little princess of the country C. The one who can make her feel wronged is only Jamie.
	In fact, Amelia used to like Jamie a lot and often followed after Jamie. She always called Jamie’s name in a sweet voice.
	Then Jamie would split the chestnut cake which was bought by Dan into half and shares it to Amelia. They would come to Dan's big and comfortable bed and roll over on it.
	Even Dan is often helpless to these two naughty girls. But there is absolutely no way to against them because as long as one is criticized, the other will definitely stand up to help her.
	Dan liked Jamie ardently and Amelia liked her particularly.
	However, he doesn’t know when the relationship between them was broken.
	Amelia lost her most temper in the Williams, crying all night. She almost can’t breathe during that night. Then she never shows a good attitude to Jamie again.
	No one knows what happened, not even Dan.
	Only Amelia knows that Jamie disappears soon after that time.
	He doesn’t know how long he sits at the dining table. Dan lifts his paralyzed legs and stands up to walk upstairs.
	When he pushes the door, he doesn't see Jamie's figure in the room. His black eyes look around the room and there is a loud sound of showering comes to his ear.
	She is taking a bath.
	Dan smiles with relief. At first, he thinks she will come to pack her luggage in a hurry. It seems that he is thinking too much.
	He walks over to the bed, but he sees the drawing board which is thrown on the bed by careless Jamie. There are several sheets of watercolor paper on it and several pens beside.
	He walks over to pick up the drawing board and looks at it carefully. He sees a painting which is the sketch of the human body on the board, but the lines gradually become messy. It looks like she cannot hold a pen stably and feels weak to draw on it. She may be impossible to draw anymore and makes a few holes in the paper.
	His lips lift lightly, releasing a light smile.
	This is Jamie's style.
	But this manuscript should be the perfume’s clothing which she is preparing for. Her hand still doesn’t recover and it is reasonable for her not to draw it well.
	Should he refuse this for her?
	Dan ponders, imagining Jamie's expression after she knows it. She must go crazy and bite him.
	"Ah!" Jamie in the bathroom is screaming, and then there is a sound of something falling to the ground. It does make some noise.
	Dan's eyes flashes slightly. He throws down the drawing board and strides to the bathroom door, slamming the door a few times, "Jamie? What happens?"
	In the bathroom, Jamie looks at the bottle that is accidentally knocked down and grins slightly. Her arm hit the wall, which hurt her shoulder at the same time. She breaks into cold sweat.
	Then she hears Dan's anxious voice from outside the door. She sees her naked body and immediately becomes anxious. Her voice is a little excited, "It's fine, I'm fine!"
	With such excitement, the hurt that Jamie just has is even more painful.
	"Really?" Dan's voice reflects a little skeptical attitude, and he stays outside the door without leaving.
	Jamie immediately stands up while holding the wall and doesn't dare to take showers anymore. She takes the clothes on the shelf and starts to put them on. She replies loudly, "It's okay. I’m really okay. Why are you so verbose?"
	She bites her tongue and doesn't dare to cry out, fearing that Dan will break into if she shouts again.
	Dan suddenly turned annoyed outside the door. What? Is he verbose?
	That damned woman. Can't she get that he cares about her? Is she out of her head?
	Dan tries to calm down so that he won’t stretch his feet to kick the door. His fingers bend on the door and he say in a calm voice, "Can you come out quickly?"
	Jamie has put on her clothes and ignores her painful feelings. She dresses herself well and walks to the door. She opens the door and is shocked by seeing Dan who is still standing by the door.
	Jamie finds that his mood is not so good so she don’t dare to say anything.
	"Are you a voyeur?" Being at their wits end, Jamie squeezes out such a sentence. Obviously, Dan's face looks gloomier.
	"Shut up!" Dan yells at her in a nasty voice. Then he takes her back collar and easily brings her to the bed.
	Jamie shrinks her neck. What does he yell at her? She never say anything wrong.
	"Why don't you dry your hair?" Dan sees her wet hair and his eyebrows frowns tightly. He stares at her unpleasantly.
	"What? I forget." Jamie swallows and glances at her wet hair. She thinks if it isn’t for his sudden appear, why will she run out without drying her hair?
	Dan fails to understand Jamie's detached way of thinking. Therefore, he takes out the hair dryer from the cabinet on one side and plugs it in. After the temperature is ready, he begins to blow her hair.
Chapter 143 If You Move again, the Consequence is Responsibly by yourself
	Jamie's bright eyes show a little surprise. Is he trying to help her blow her hair?
	While Jamie is guessing, Dan has already taken action.
	His fingers are very flexible, as if it has its own consciousness to cross back and forth between her hair. Every time when his fingertips scratch her scalp, it will cause an unspeakable feeling of shiver.
	Jamie lowers her eyes, hiding the feelings in her eyes.
	She can’t understand him more and more.
	Does she like him? She guesses she isn’t. But with Ian, they must be married in the future.
	However, Jamie doesn’t want to marry Dan at all. She even resists this matter
	But now Amelia is back, she will never let her become her sister-in-law, which happens to be in line with Jamie's thoughts.
	As for Ian, it is quite troublesome to handle.
	"What are you considering?" Dan takes the hair dryer away and finds her confusing expression, not knowing what she is thinking about. But the softest place in her heart just hurt for a while.
	The hurt is subtle enough to be negligible.
	But Dan really feels it, and feels distressed about the little woman in front of him.
	It is just because of one of her expressions.
	The expression that makes him unable to feel uncomfortable.
	Jamie is interrupted by his voice and regains her mind. She shakes her head and replies, "It's okay."
	However, there must be something when she says that she is okay.
	Dan is very clear about that but he doesn’t point it out. He glances at her confusing face and his eyes stops on her arm. There is a little bruise, which should be the reason for the scream just now.
	This little woman, who recently don not know why is so out of luck, is always injured. Even when she takes a shower, she can fall down and causes a bruise on her arm.
	Dan manifests his helpless feelings in his black eyes. Then he takes out the potion from the cabinet and sits next to her. He put her arm on his thigh and applies the potion to her.
	"Why is there another bruise?" Jamie’s thought is interrupted by him again. Therefore she turns her head to have a look. She finds that the arm she just hit is actually blue again! It turns blue!
	Has she been too unlucky recently? Even taking a bath will make her so embarrassed?
	It has to say that the couple's thinking is still similar to each other. It can give them a compliment.
	"You should ask yourself" Dan glances at her angrily. His sight is very charming that it can confuse people’s mind. Jamie now is overwhelmed by his charming eyes.
	What does he do this?
	Does he make up for her after slapping? Does he use his handsome again?
	"Don't think you I will forget it is you who beat me after you show me you’re handsome!" Jamie bulges her lightly red cheeks as if she is unreasonable.
	However, just now there is no bruise. As soon as Dan touches it, it just turns blue. So Jamie will automatically blame it on Dan.
	It can be seen how bad Dan's impression is in her heart.
	Dan sighs that the woman is so unromantic. It feels better when she keeps silent. Every time she talks, she is just a wet blanket.
	He really wants to beat her at this time.
	"Shut up. Otherwise I will throw you out."
	"You can have a try. Will I be afraid of you?" Jamie rolls her eyes and whispers with her some backbone.
	Dan's movements stop for a moment. And he put down the potion bottle under Jamie's startled gaze. He holds Jamie up directly, and walks to the balcony.
	"What are you doing?" Jamie grabs Dan's clothes subconsciously and watches him walk to the balcony.
	Below is the swimming pool. The cool wind makes Jamie can't help shivering.
	"What am I doing?" Dan narrows his eyes and his lips slightly raises. He smiles, as if his beautiful appearance, which is noble and elegant, makes he cannot look directly at her. The bright in his eyes can attract people's attention.
	It is such a man who is so cruel and indifferent to the extreme. Even when he smiles, he is extremely intimidating.
	The silence and coldness that express from his body shocks Jamie more than the cool breeze.
	She seems to have no wrong opinion, right?
	"Ah!" Jamie screams because Dan actually lifts her up to face the swimming pool. She is scared and her expression turns bad. Immediately she hugs his neck with all her power!
	How does she offend this boss?
	Can he tell her that she can change her opinion?
	"Dan, don't hold a pessimistic view towards things. Don't you want to die with me?" Jamie shouts loudly, holding his neck and wishing to stick on him tightly. She definitely refuses to let go of it.
	Otherwise, she will fall off as soon as she let go of it!
	Die with her? Dan’s eyes show a little delight when he hears these words. He also feels that her weak body is rubbing against his chest. He actually has some reaction to his lower abdomen. His eyes gradually darken.
	"If you move again, I will throw you down immediately!" Dan's voice was hoarse. He feels the little woman hanging on him finally stops and takes a sigh of relief.
	Suddenly, Jamie moves even more!
	"Ah! You pervert! You hoodlum! You do ..." Jamie's face is flushed and she is moving towards Dan's shoulder hardly. But when she moves up, she falls down finally.
	Although she holds Dan's neck, she can still feel the hot thing on her ass!
	She is not an idiot. She had a sexual relationship with Dan five years ago. Therefore, she is clear about what is it!
	Hoodlum! Hoodlum! ! Dare he treat her in this way?
	Jamie bites her bottom lip with anger and shame. Even so, she still can’t let go of her hand and can only hold Dan. But the thing below rubs her ass, which makes her ashamed and wants to die.
	A little flush appears on Dan's face and his eyes blink lightly. He also is helpless by Jamie’s movements. Does she know that it can irritate his sexual desire?
	"Am I a pervert? Don't you know that this is the normal physiological reaction of men?" He retorts but he is a little depressed. Why can’t his possessiveness work before her?
	"But, you can't ..." Glib as Jamie is, she is unable to say anything at this time. Then she holds Dan's neck and aims at his shoulders to bite his right shoulder!
	She just takes a few movements. Why will he have reaction?
	But Miss Moore really underestimates her influence in front of Dan and underestimates the man who hasn’t had sex in five years.
	His possessiveness has always been useful before other women.
	"Don't move! If you move again, the consequence is responsibly by yourself!" Dan's voice is very low with a faint sense of charm. His deep eyes is about to go crazy when he looks at Jamie directly.
	Jamie doesn’t dare to move anymore and swallows nervously. If he really wants to force her, her skill is really not enough.
	
Chapter 144 This Man is Dangerous
	And even if she wants to escape, she can’t escape now. After all, here is his territory. What he says is the order.
	The closer her body is, the more Dan feels that his possessiveness is collapsing little by little. And the smell of her fragrance near his nose scratches him like cat claws.
	He is feeling bad.
	Dan turns around and walks back to the room, walking towards the big bed.
	Jamie wrinkles her small face. Is she going to be caught by him today?
	"Dan, wait. Wait." Thinking of that, Jamie's movements are faster than her brain thinking. She holds Dan's hand and looks at him nervously.
	Dan is already uncomfortable, considering about going to the bathroom to solve it. While now he is stopped by her, his face is slightly turning bad. He raises his eyebrows to look at her.
	"You know there are many ways to solve it. It doesn't have to need a woman, right?" Jamie bears under his sights for a few seconds and then says quickly, "I haven’t taken a bath for a few days. Can you just let me go? "
	With tension, what she says are so stupid... Haven’t she taken a bath for a few days? What does she just do in the bathroom? Is she swimming?
	Dan's mouth twitches, and he gives her a fierce glance. The woman does think that he is going to have sex with her.
	If he can, he really wants to do!
	Everything is just for her thoughts. Otherwise why will he wrong himself?
	But Dan doesn't plan to let Jamie go like this now. Thinking of this, he rests himself upon Jamie and looks at her with the black eyes that are so charming, "Then you can tell me the other methods."
	She can see the hope!
	Jamie's eyes light up suddenly. As long as the method is not her, everything is okay!
	Jamie tilts her head and thinks about it. Can she find him another woman?
	"Should I find a woman to you?" Jamie blinks and looks at him as if she has a good idea. She is still complacent in coming up with such a good way for him.
	But she doesn’t find that Dan's face quickly darkens.
	He is totally angry and the whole person exudes a sense of coolness.
	Through the thin clothes, Jamie can feel the cold from him as if it can freeze people.
	Her body shivers involuntarily. What happens?
	Dan stares at Amelia who is shrinking under him and his thin lips raises. His long fingers gently touch Jamie's cheek while his voice is cold extremely. His voice appears straightly towards Jamie, “Are you giving me to other women in such a hurry?”
	Jamie's heartbeat seems to miss a beat. She is very clear that he is angry. The more beautiful he is when smiles, the more dangerous he is.
	However, Jamie still can’t figure it out. Why will she upset him?
	"This is a solution." Jamie murmurs and she doesn’t dare to look at him.
	The atmosphere on him is cold and dangerous. It has a momentum that no one dares to go against him and it is overwhelming, which still covers Jamie.
	Jamie suddenly finds that this man is very dangerous.
	The last second he will still favor you. But in the next second, you will be pushed into the vortex by him.
	"Solution?" Dan snorts and looks at her delicate and elegant face which is close to him. His eyes show his anger, "Let me tell you what the real solution is."
	After saying that, he leans closer to Jamie's ear and murmurs gently, as if he is whispering to his closest lovers. However, his words are fatal and dangerous.
	"Aren't you going to help me solve it? Well?"
	Jamie feels as if her body cannot move anymore and she does not dare to move. Dan's sudden change makes her a little scared from her mind.
	Because she doesn’t know what he wants to do next.
	In the end, she can only compromise under his terrifying eyes.
	She hopes he will regard himself as a kind man and let her go.
	But will Dan be that kind-hearted person? Of course not.
	"Then you give me yourself. Isn’t it faster?" Dan whispers and raises her chin, looking at her expression. She is obviously frightened and opens her mouth. But she can’t say anything. Seeing her appearance, there is a wave of impatience in his heart.
	Damn woman. She is even thinking of pushing him to another woman.
	Isn't he so important in her eyes? Or does she never like him in her heart?
	Anger, irritation, complexity. All above intertwines in Dan's mind.
	Suddenly, sadness appears in the bottom of his heart. Does she not love him in her mind? Or does she disdain to love him?
	When Jamie hears his words, her whole person is anxious. Her face blushes a little like a ripe cherry which it is tempting for others to pick, "I can't do it. You can go find someone else. I ... Um!"
	Before she has finished speaking, Jamie's small mouth which is chattering is caught by Dan who is leaning over to accurately capture her. He is afraid he will strangle her if he listens to her again!
	Jamie stares at the enlarged face in front of her. His lips are very hot with a touch of eagerness. Mow he is exploring on her lips and then attacking the city.
	Is he serious?
	Jamie's small face twitches, thinking about it sadly. She has proposed such a good way. Why does he still play bully against her?
	With her lips sealed tightly, Jamie can only groan in her heart. Her nose is filled with the light mint fragrance from his body. Her face is quite hot so she pats on his chest by her small hand.
	Suddenly, there is a pain in her lip. Jamie realizes that she is bitten by Dan punitively. He bright eyes looks flirtatious and her slickness makes people fail to turn away.
	After the kiss, Jamie's body has softened and can’t have any energy. She can just glare at Dan while breathing. And the clothes on her shoulders are pulled down a little by him, revealing the fair and delicate skin.
	Hum!
	Jamie snorts heavily and rolls on the quilt before Dan moves, rolling back and forth several times and wrapping herself tightly. She only stares at him with her small head exposed.
	Her eyes are filled with dissatisfaction. There are some swellings and teeth marks on her lips.
	Miss Moore is not happy because she is bitten by Dan and she doesn't bite him back.
	Dan looks at her with a terrible expression while his eyebrows tightly frown. He pulls the quilt which is wrapped around her, "Come out."
	"No!" Miss Moore is very stubborn this time, narrowing her neck and looking directly at his eyes.
	"You!" Dan's face is darker. And the heat that is converging toward his lower abdomen makes his eyes gradually bright.
	Suddenly, his pupil shrinks.
	The little woman in front of him crumples her mouth and there was a hint of grievance in her eyes, which seems to be silently accusing him of his behavior. And she no longer looks at him.
Chapter 145 the Time is Quiet and Peaceful
	Damn it.
	Dan's rising desire is instantly extinguished and he has to rub his black hair irritably. He gets up and walks into the bathroom.
	After a while, Jamie hears the noise of showering inside.
	Suddenly she relieves.
	Once she relaxes, Jamie rolls around a few times. She rolls into the middle of the bed and releases the quilt. She pulls the quilt over her body and looks at the ceiling.
	It is still painful of her lips.
	It can even let her ignore the pain in her shoulder.
	She reaches out and touches her lips as if the pain will amplify her senses. How can she feel the pain in her shoulder even more?
	It's just that Jamie seems to understand although Dan looks cold and indifferent, in fact he is a dangerous man.
	All of his danger and coercion are hidden under his seemingly indifferent face. Once it breaks out, it will disappear.
	Even she doesn’t know how she irritates him. Almost she is about to be caught by him.
	Jamie is afraid of him. For other people, they will also be afraid.
	But in the end Dan still let her go, which makes Jamie a little puzzled. It isn’t her self-imagination. But just now, he is anxious definitely.
	Jamie titles her head and thinks that in the future she won’t irritate him if possible. Who knows how will this big boss do to her next time?
	For the reasons of safety, it is best to stay away from him...
	While thinking, Jamie closes her eyes and feels more and sleepier. Finally she falls asleep in a daze.
	One thought that flashes before falling asleep is that she’d better keep farther away from Dan.
	When Dan comes out of the bathroom, Jamie is already asleep. The quiet appearances of sleeping makes Dan lose his mind for a while. His hands which are drying the wet hair gradually stops, and he throws the white and dry towel on the stool.
	He sits gently on the edge of the bed, staring at her sleepy face. Suddenly there is an urge to wake her up!
	Damn it. She leaves him alone to bear the sexual desire. But she is sleeping so happily.
	Dan's gloomy eyes show a few frustration and helplessness.
	What should he do for her?
	In the end, he stands up irritably and walks out of the balcony. He takes out a bad of cigarettes and is about to light it up. Suddenly he remembers something. He throws it aside and stands up against the wind. He doesn’t know how long has he stood in the cool breeze.
	It takes a long time and even his wet hair becomes dried in the end.
	Dan turns around leisurely to walks inside and closes the French window.
	He walks to the other side of the bed and turns off the light, leaving only the wall lamp in the room with a dark orange light.
	Lying down, he gently turns his face to look at Jamie who is asleep. He can hear the calm breathing sound from his side. Then he rolls over and suddenly moves closer to Jamie.
	Then he reaches out and hugs Jamie into his arms, lowering his jaw against her hair. He hums comfortably and closes his eyes.
	It seems that the time is quite and the life is peaceful...
	Derek follows Amelia to go out of the manor. But he only finds that she does not go to the Williams’ house. She drives her car to a bar.
	Amelia gets out of the fiery red Ferrari, throwing the car key to the parking boy. And then she steps on the high heel of twelve centimeters into the bar which is called "Blue light".
	Derek frowns. He has been with Dan since he is very young. He has never seen Amelia came to such a place. If Dan knows it, she will be punished.
	Blue light Bar is a well-known in City A. It has good management and safety. Amelia, as a daughter of the Williams, is naturally impossible to go to those terrible bars with bad guys. It is relatively safe here.
	Because the people who gathers here are all the dudes. No one dares to bully Amelia.
	"Give me a glass of blue Hawaii." Amelia sits in front of the bar. The colorful lights in the bar bright around. She can only see the men and women who are singing and dancing in the bar by the dim light. With the deafening music, they are dancing happily.
	Amelia narrows her beautiful eyes and taps her fingers on the bar.
	Derek stays around her, watching carefully around to ensure her safety.
	A glass of blue Hawaii is quickly prepared, and Amelia picks up the glass. She shakes it lightly and then drinks it out.
	After all, cocktails are not spirits. Even if Amelia drinks several glasses, she won’t be drunk.
	However, Amelia looks so beautiful. Her noble temperament and elegance can't be ignored. Even if when you just take a glance at her, you can see she is beautiful.
	If you look beautiful, you will naturally attract others.
	Amelia put down her glass and wants to enter the dance floor. But she doesn’t know who grabs her wrist. "This lady, please have a wait."
	Amelia stops impatiently and turns her head casually to see him. Then she sees a man who looks pretty but wears all the famous brands. He may be afraid that others will not know that he has a lot of money.
	"What's the matter?" Amelia withdraws her hand and frowns in disgust.
	Who dares to touch her?
	The man pretends not to see the disgust in her eyes and rubs his hands to look at her. The greedy and desire appear in his eyes, "I don't know what your name is? Can we become friends?"
	"I have no interests." Amelia rolls her eyes up and then is about to leave. But her wrist is caught again.
	This time, the man’s complexion is obviously not very good. But for the beauty in front of him, he still pretends to be a rich man and says, "The price can be decided on you if you stay with me for one night!"
	Oops.
	Amelia laughs at once.
	Staying with him for one night?
	Amelia stares at him coldly, throwing his hand away with a strong force, "Stay with you for one night? What the hell are you? Dare you let me stay with you? Why don't you look yourself in the mirror before you go out? You are really ugly and even scare me."
	"You! You still don’t know what's good! It’s your good fortune if I appreciate you!" The man is obviously annoyed when he is insulted by Amelia. Then he can’t bear this anger.
	He must get this lady with all means!
	"What the hell are you?" Amelia repeats again and she has a new disdainful smile, which looks noble to the extreme, as if she is looking at the man like a ant.
	The man is irritated by Amelia again and deeply feels that his dignity of a man is insulted by Amelia. He raises his hand and almost hit her.
	"Ah!" A scream comes out in this corner. It will not be heard if you are not near here.
	However, it's just not from Amelia but the man just now.
	His hand is held by Derek, and he folds it back gently. Therefore the man's face instantly turns red and he can’t struggle away.
	
Chapter 146 Jozo and Amelia
	Amelia sees it with cold eyes and raises his eyebrows at the sudden appearance of Derek. His face looks so cool and his body exudes a chill feeling, which inexplicably makes Amelia's heartbeat accelerate.
	How will he be here?
	"You. Who are you?" The man sees the sudden appearance of Derek. He is so painful that he even bends his waist down. And his anger quickly disappears now and becomes cowardly.
	"Do you know who she is? You must want to die because you dare to hit her." Derek says coldly and then he uses force with his hand. The man's wrist makes a crisp, "Creak."
	It seems that the bones are broken.
	The man is so painful that he can’t speak. He can only open his eyes and sees his hand broken. And it is the hand that has just pulled Amelia.
	Amelia smiles secretly.
	Her eyes look faintly at Derek who is twisting off the man's hand and has a sweet arc on his lips.
	"Amelia, how do you want to treat this man?" Derek turns his head and looks at Amelia who keeps a sweet smile on her face. His voice is always cold without any emotions.
	Even so, Amelia feels warm in her heart.
	"Let him go. Let's go." Amelia glances at the bowed man lying in the corner and covering his broken and painful wrist. She raises her eyebrows proudly and leaves by holding Derek.
	The temperature from the palm of her hand makes Amelia smiles more pleasantly.
	Yes, she likes Derek for a long time.
	From the first time she loves, she hasn’t stopped to like him until now.
	When she was in Italy, she looked at the only picture of him in her hand and spent the years day by day.
	But only she knows this secret.
	Just like why she once broke up with Jamie suddenly, only she knows it.
	Derek accompanies Amelia in the bar for about two or three hours. Amelia becomes dizzy and drunk. There is no way that Derek has to take her back to the Williams’ house firstly. When she wakes up, she can have her own decision. .
	————
	Staying in the manor for the past few days, Jamie’s injury on her shoulder and allergies are almost all right. According to Jim, as long as she doesn’t lift heavy things and doesn’t exercise vigorously, she will not cause the injury to recur and have sequelae.
	She doesn't known what happens to Dan and why he is so free in these few days. Jamie can see him sleeping beside her when she wakes up.
	For this, Miss Moore, she has changed from the initial shock and resistance to the current numbness.
	Knowing that resistance is useless, then she doesn’t have to resist. Miss Moore is not the kind of person who will waste her energy. She has to keep her energy to enjoy the food.
	Jamie really has the illusion that they still love each other and fall asleep together every morning when she opens eyes and sees Dan's face.
	It’s just an illusion.
	It is almost noon now and Jamie almost finishes her design draft, except for the color and design instructions. Then she should send it to the computer and send to Ryan. It is almost about to come to an end.
	She takes her clothes to the bathroom and put them on. Wearing the indoor slippers, she goes to the second floor while her ponytail behind wings as she walks.
	Suddenly, her steps towards downstairs paused. She stuns when she sees Amelia and Jozo sitting on the sofa. She doesn't know what they are talking about.
	Her headache begins suddenly.
	God really treats her in a good way that it puts those who hate her together.
	When Amelia sees Jamie coming down, she raises her eyebrows at her provocatively, holding Jozo's hand intimately without letting go. "You are really a freeloader. Do you really think that you’re already married?"
	Jamie just ignores her. She regards her words like the air. Walking to the other side of the sofa, she stays away from them and sits down.
	Jozo still smiles gently. She no longer has the embarrassment and sorrow in Dan's birthday. She looks up at Jamie politely with a sweet smile on her face, "Miss Moore, I haven't seen you for a long time."
	"Yes." Jamie responds calmly without any emotion and takes a fashion magazine from the table to read.
	Jozo's smile is stiff. After a moment of calm, she becomes polite again.
	"Don't you see that I have guests here? Can't you sit far away?" Amelia raises her chin overbearingly. It really irritates her when she sees Jamie sitting as if she regards her as air.
	She just relies on her brother’s love. What the big deal she is?
	Jamie leans on the sofa and places the magazine between her legs. She looks down at the magazine with her head propped up. Hearing Amelia’s words, she lazily raises her eyes and looks at her, "What does this business have to do with me although she is your guest?”
	The few simple words come out directly and straightly, which makes Amelia's original arrogant look suddenly become lost.
	She stares at her with her teeth clenched. She is just about to say something but she sees Dan holding the phone in one hand and putting his hand in the trouser pocket. He is walking towards this direction.
	"Dan!" Amelia shouts happily, seeing Dan walking over but stopping beside Jamie and sitting down.
	Jamie looks up at him and then continues to read the magazine.
	"Dan." Jozo sits there a little awkwardly, fearing that Dan will be unhappy.
	He tells her very clearly last time and let her not come to the manor if she hasn’t something important. But now...
	Dan frowns when he sees that Jozo is also there. Although there is some displeasure in his eyes, he still doesn’t show it but nods lightly.
	Jozo squeezes her skirt awkwardly, not knowing what to say.
	Amelia, seeing through Jozo's embarrassment, begins to explain, "Dan, it is I who sees Jozo when I come back. So I bring her back on my own initiative. Won't you blame me?"
	Dan smiles helplessly and glances at Jozo, who is sitting there quietly and obediently. Then he says to Amelia, "I won’t."
	"That's great. Then there has someone to accompany me in the future and I won't be so bored." Amelia takes Jozo's hand affectionately as if she likes Jozo very much.
	Jozo smiles sweetly, "It’s my honor to accompany Amelia."
	Jamie chuckles in her heart. How long has they known each other? Jozo already Amelia’s names so sweetly. Well, Amelia's awareness of vigilance is really not so good.
	"Since then, you can come here every day to accompany me. Then I don’t have to be annoyed when I see the woman without any emotion every day." Amelia says with indication, glancing at Jamie repeatedly.
	
Chapter 147 You’re Childish as Before
	Jamie rolls her eyes up. Does Ameliai say that she has no emotion? She doesn't understand when will Amelia stop to go against her?
	But she knows that if Amelia and Jozo join together, it is her who will suffer a lot.
	"Who? Who makes Amelia so unhappy?" Jozo asks, pretending that she asks because she doesn’t know.
	"Who else can be? It is Miss Moore. She always wanders in front of me and makes me annoyed." Amelia groans, completely ignoring Dan's suddenly angry expression. She still continues her words.
	"Oh." Jozo, such a tactful girl, always stares at Dan. How can't she see Dan's displeased expression? She stops immediately and laughed for a few times.
	"Dan, Amelia, the lunch is ready. Please go to the restaurant to enjoy." Alma comes over and says respectfully.
	Jozo orders her to the kitchen to help as soon as she comes here. Obviously she doesn’t want Alma to hear her and Amelia's plans, worrying that she will complain it to others.
	But Jozo really thinks much more. In general, Alma will ignore what she does.
	Moreover, she follows Jozo around the clock and there is no chance to complain to Dan in front of her.
	"Let's go and have lunch." Dan stands up first and says to Jamie who is still reading the magazine.
	"Well." Jamie put the magazine down, and sees Amelia's expression suddenly changed. Then she changes her idea and walks over to hold Dan's hand. She answers sweetly, "Let’s go."
	Her smile is as bright as the moment when all the flower in the garden are flourishing.
	Dan's eyes shine and there is some ecstasy in his heart. Does this stupid girl finally awaken?
	There is some exciting emotion in his heart. But his expressions are still calm and he nods gently.
	Amelia is angry when she watches Jamie walking into the room by holding Dan's hand. She raises her foot to kick the table fiercely.
	Jozo pushes her wheelchair forward and a pitiful feeling in her eyes. She looks at Amelia who is irritated but still struggles to keep calm, "Amelia, your brother's relationship with Jamie is really good."
	Amelia feels disapproved when she hears it. Then she sneers and answers disdainfully, "It’s wrong. if it isn't for that she lives next door to my house, how can she have a good relationship with Dan?"
	"No matter how good the relationship is, my brother won't marry her." Amelia says quietly in the last sentence.
	"What are you talking about, Amelia?" Jozo doesn't hear her last sentence and feels a little puzzled.
	"No, I don't say anything. Let's go. Let's go to have lunch." Amelia's eyes flick in a panic and then she quickly conceals it by herself, pushing Jozo to the restaurant.
	Alma stands behind them and meditates.
	As a member from the training camp, all of her physical qualities are excellent. Especially her hearing is many times better than others. Even some subtle sounds cannot be missed through her ears.
	So for Amelia's last sentence just now, Alma can hear it very clearly.
	And it’s hard not to hear clearly.
	She sighs secretly, feeling that this kind of thing doesn’t need to tell Dan. After all, it is not a big deal. Moreover, Dan doesn’t want his private affairs always to be bothered by others.
	As his subordinates, she just keeps silent.
	Later, Alma realizes that her unintentional behavior today almost becomes a painful scar in Jamie and Dan's heart.
	At the dining table, Jamie sits on Dan's right hand. While Jozo is pushed to Dan's left hand by Amelia and Amelia is sitting opposite Jamie. She snorts from time to time, expressing her dissatisfaction.
	She is not only dissatisfied. As long as Jamie is here for a day, she will not make her feel comfortable.
	Compared to Amelia's excitement, Jamie seems much calmer. She never feels aggrieved at all and enjoys everything she wants here. It isn't she who feels angry anyway. There is no need to influence her appetite for an unnecessary person.
	The key point is still the last sentence.
	Amelia sees that Jamie ignores her completely and doesn’t take her provocation into consideration. Her own temper which is formed from her childhood suddenly roses. She places the wine glass to the table heavily and makes a loud noise.
	Dan stares at her and put down the cutlery in his hand. His eyes show his warning and looks at Amelia with an invincible momentum, "Amelia, does your etiquette teacher teach you to act in this way?"
	Amelia shrinks her shoulders and looks at Dan grievously. She is not afraid of her dad, her mother, but her elder brother.
	But what makes her most uncomfortable is that her brother helps Jamie every time!
	"Amelia is also childish. You don't have to criticize her so seriously, Dan." Jozo says gently, glancing at Amelia to comfort her. She also hints her not to act rashly. Otherwise it will be contrary to their wishes.
	Amelia's movements gradually become less. She stares at the glass of wine in front of her and wobbles it. Then she smiles.
	"I never indulge her. The daughter of the Williams must have the regulations." Dan answers calmly.
	The implication is that this is our family's business. As an outsider, it is better not to intervene.
	Jozo is so tactful. How can't she hear the meaning in his words? For a time, her eyes are a bit bleak.
	"Oops." Amelia screams while covering her mouth. Her eyes widen and she pretends to have an innocent look that she doesn’t do it deliberately. If you just look at it simply, you really can't see anything fake.
	Dan frowns and sees that the glass in front of Amelia falls down. The wine in the glass flows down the tablecloth to Jamie and it spills on the clothes on Jamie's chest.
	However the cloth is a white one with checkered pattern. This cloth is really suitable for her. Even when Dan sees it, he really feels surprised.
	After being stained by red wine, it is estimated that it can no longer be worn.
	"I don’t do it deliberately. I just reach out for it and it falls down ..." Although Amelia says to Jamie as if she looks so sorry, but the statement reveals that she is clearly satisfied.
	Jamie frowns, thinking that Amelia is still childish as before.
	Spilling red wine on her clothes is the matter that so she can do.
	"I’m afraid that Jamie can't wear this dress again. So go and change it." Jozo suggests thoughtfully.
	
Chapter 148 There are still a lot Things to Learn
	But it sounds like she is the host while Jamie is a guest.
	Jamie's mouth raises, revealing a perfect and impeccable smile. "I have to change the clothes. Jozo, you can enjoy your food slowly. And I'll be back soon."
	The position of the host and guest is revised again at once.
	Jozo's expression can’t be good.
	Dan smiles faintly with satisfaction in his eyes. He knows that she can’t let them bully her without saying a word.
	Only when she bullies them back, she is the real Jamie.
	If it's just a small interlude on the dining table, Jamie has to sigh that Amelia's small interlude is really a lot.
	First when she watches the fashion show, the plug of TV is suddenly pulled out by Amelia. Then she turns to read magazines. Then those magazines are actually replaced by brick books by someone. All of the books are written in French. She doesn’t care at all. Anyway, it’s okay as long as it can spend the time.
	All these make Amelia very depressed. Jamie actually reads brick books more happily than fashion magazines.
	So what should she do?
	Of course, Amelia can’t give up like this. She runs upstairs to find out Jamie's clothes and cut them all.
	Jamie only feeling that the corners of her mouth are twitching, but she is not angry.
	Being angry with such a childish person, Jamie considers it as a waste of time.
	"Are you annoyed? You can leave my house if you are annoyed! Hum!" Amelia throws the scissors proudly down to the ground and walks out with her head raising.
	Jamie looks at the mess and sighs wearily.
	She really just wanted to live a quiet life. They can fight and angry with each other. But she must keep her private time quiet.
	Who does she really trouble?
	Jamie rolls her eyes up and simply sits on the carpet. She lies underneath her clothes which are cut by Amelia. Some of them are decorated with accessories. So she feels a little uncomfortable. But she is too lazy to move.
	"Mommy, why do you lie here like a dead fish?" Ian's small head suddenly appears in Jamie's eyes. Ian is blinking his big eyes. He put his small hands on the strap of the backpack and looks at her.
	Dead fish?
	Jamie feels awkwardly and sits up. She grabs Ian's soft face and rubs it, "Bad boy. You really can climb up the roof to amuse me without my recent attack, right?"
	Ian tilts his head innocently and looks at the top of his heads. Then he tells Jamie seriously, "Mommy, there are no roof here."
	"Humph." Jamie snorts softly, "Well, you have been with Night.1 these days. Do you hear anything about Jack?"
	Ian put down his backpack and crosses his legs to sit next to Jamie. He glances at the shredded clothes on the ground. He is a little confused. Is there a thief at home?
	"I hear something. He has minor injuries of leg and hand as well as severe burns. He cannot be discharged from the hospital in a short time." Ian picks up a piece of shredded clothing and looks at Jamie. "Mommy, who cut these clothes?”
	"It is cut by a childish woman." Thinking of this, Jamie feels that her head is aching. As long as Amelia is still here for a day, it is estimated that there will not be a peaceful day.
	If she can, can she leave here...
	"Is there another woman living here?" Ian only feels that his hair is going to be upright when he hears her words. When does this happen? Why doesn’t he know?
	"Yes, bunny. You must not run around at night. Otherwise the woman will jump out and grab you away!" Jamie makes a grabbing gesture and then falls to the ground, refusing to get up again.
	However, Ian looks at Jamie and says with his mouth pursed, "Bunny is a man and I'm not afraid of anything!"
	"You’d better not afraid. If you're afraid, you don't run into mommy's bed and beg for comfort." Jamie laughs happily on the floor, kicking the shredded clothes under her feet away and lying down comfortably.
	This soft carpet on the ground is no worse than the bed.
	She narrows her eyes comfortably.
	Ian purses his small mouth and his eyes blinks with some bad emotion. He is a man and he is not afraid.
	At night.
	Ian looks at the clock on the wall. A camera is opened on the laptop in front of him. The scene appears in the computer is the hospital where Jack is located and Jack is in the ward.
	Ian slides the mouse and looks at the surveillance video from time to time.
	This is the pinhole camera he let Night.1 put in Jack's ward. It's also for his mommy's sake. If Jack blames this accident on his mommy, it will be bad.
	And according to uncle Chris, Jack also has an important hole card.
	That's why Chris doesn't dare to take risk to return to Country C. Even though he keeps pretending to be a spy to contact Jack, he never knows who the person is and where he is.
	As long as Jack still has that person in hand, as long as he takes that card out, there are very few people who can attack him.
	Ian never thinks that his nominal grandfather is easy to deal with. He can take away his grandmother when her family is destroyed and hides it under the eyes of everyone.
	The injury should be too serious that Jack and Celina never wake up.
	Ian licks the dry lips and he is a little thirsty. So he stands up and walks out.
	The hallway is dark, and the light of the street lamp penetrates through the French windows. He is barely able to see it clearly.
	Ian's pace is very stable and flat. It’s not like the calm pace that a child will have, which also thanks to Night.1 They exercises him during this time to have such a significant effect.
	This makes Ian, who used to know to protect mommy by his wisdom, suddenly understand that he has to fight them with his body if he wants to fight against the enemy.
	He is still young and there are many things to learn.
	Ian walks down the stairs by holding the handrails and turns on the light of the living room. He walks to the refrigerator and find milk in it.
	There are too many things in the refrigerator. Ian can’t find it so he walks to the next refrigerator and opens it. The milk is placed at a position opposite to his height and he can touch it if he reaches out.
	Ian takes a bottle of yogurt and closes the refrigerator, turning around and going back.
	But when he turns around and is just about to take another step, a horrible scene happens at this time!
	A woman in a white dress with pale face, white lips and red hair appears in front of him.
	"Ah!" The woman does not expect to encounter a child in a black suit and the child is looking at her straightly.
	
Chapter 149 Rescue
	Ian feels confused at once. Thus, he just keeps silent, staring at the woman in front of her.
	“A ghost!” Before Ian Moore can make a sound, the woman turns and runs as fast as she could toward the stairs. And she almost falls down.
	What? Is he a ghost?
	Looking at the woman who is running with fear and does not know her skirt being hooked by the carving of the staircase, Ian Moore feels funny. Though the woman tries her best to run, she can’t move in the end.
	He does not shout “A ghost”, but he is regarded as a “ghost” by the woman.
	Ian touches his soft handsome face, and looks at himself on the reflective refrigerator. In his opinion, he is so handsome that he does not look like a ghost any more. He thinks that the woman does not have the judgment.
	Thinking of this, Ian walks slowly toward the stairs with the yogurt. The woman wants to run away, but she fails to move forwards because her skirt is hooked by the carving of the staircase. Looking at her struggling, Ian feels it really funny.
	And Ian thinks that he is cute and kind fatty and that he should help the woman.
	Though the person he will help is a female ghost...
	Ian bends slightly and pulls out the corner of his skirt, which is hanging in the carving. The woman does not know that Ian helps her, so she keeps running and falls down forwards.
	“Are you...” Ian smiles gently. He wants to asks her whether she is fine or not, but he is interrupted.
	“Don’t come!” The mask on the woman's face has fallen off. She is Amelia.
	When she sees that Ian is coming to her, she becomes more and more fearful. Shouting loudly, she runs upstairs as soon as possible.
	She almost falls down.
	Toughing his nose, Ian Moore feels uncomfortable. He feels heartbroken and needs to be comforted.
	Standing at the door of his own room, Ian looks at door of Dan and Jamie’s room. He rolls his eyes and tries to grin.
	After adjusting his emotion, Ian put down the yogurt. And then he opens the door of Dan and Jamie’s room fearfully and walks inside.
	“Mom! Mom!” he shouts as he runs, looking very frightened.
	Though Dan and Jamie sleep in the same bed, they are separated by a quilt.
	Dan gets up and sees that a little figure goes into Jamie’s side. And then Ian goes into Jamie’s arms.
	“Mom, I see a female ghost!” Ian holds Jamie tightly. He stares at Jamie in panic.
	“A female ghost? Where is it?” Jamie frowns when she is told. Then she asks Dan, “Is there any ghost here?”
	“Yes, I have seen it. She has long hair in white. And she wants to yank off me!” Ian holds Jamie tightly.
	However, Ian is snickering, like a sly fox.
	“It can’t be seen any ghost here. Besides, there are patrols at night. And I have lived here for five years.”
	“There must be ghost here. I am afraid, so I want to sleep with you tonight!” Ian stares at Jamie with tears in his eyes, and Jamie can’t bear to give him a refusal.
	But Ian has just said that he is a great man and that he does not afraid anything.
	TSK.
	Jamie feels happy and she holds Ian tightly, “I am here, and no one can take you away.”
	Because there is a monster near her.
	Dan looks at Ian being in Jamie’s arms, he feels a little unhappy. Because Jamie as his mother comes to his mind first, Dan has no idea why Ian comes into his wide arms.
	“Childish.” He whispers. Then he lies down, looks sideways at Ian in Jamie’s arms with jealousy.
	When will Ian be so close to him?
	But there is nothing he can do. He has missed Ian’s childhood, so he has to be patient.
	“My baby, come here.” Dan finally waves to Ian, beckoning him to come into his arms.
	“OK.” Ian replays, getting into Dan’s arms.
	Feeling Ian’s soft body in his arms, Dan is very satisfied, holding Ian tightly.
	Jamie curls her lips and becomes surprised when looking at Dan’s satisfied expression.
	This makes Jamie know that Dan really loves Ian, not pretending.
	“Mom, please come closer me.” Ian turns around, beckoning Jamie.
	Jamie smiles, and thinks that her son requests too much.
	Dan coughs nods and looks at Jamie. It seems that he really agree with Ian.
	Jamie hesitates for a moment. She wonders that Dan can’t do anything to her with Ian between them.
	Then she moves closer to Ian. With one hand holding Jamie and the other hand holding Dan, Ian lies down, closes his eyes and falls asleep.
	He may be the happiest baby in the world.
	In other to avoid eye contacting with Dan, Jamie also closes her eyes. Even though she can fall asleep, she has to pretend sleeping.
	Jamie has her own plan.
	She cannot stay here any longer. And she does not worry that Ian gets together with Dan.
	She wants to go back her own flat. If Amelia goes to bother her again, she will not let her go.
	Jamie sighs, and she has no idea that when Amelia can let her go.
	It is so quiet at night. They sleep in the same bed. Ian has a sweet sleep, and Jamie closes her eyes and almost falls asleep, but Dan seems to think about something.
	It seems that Dan hopes they can be like that in the future.
	When talking about happiness, most people try to get it. But in Jamie’s mind, she regards happiness as nothing.
	Ian has to go to school, so he gets up early. Then Dan also wakes up. They go to the bathroom to wash quietly. But after they finish washing, Jamie does not wake up yet.
	
Chapter 150 She must be Successful
	Of course, Dan and Ian do not wake her up, but leave the room and goes down to breakfast.
	“Dad, you have to forgive mom’s laziness.” Carrying his schoolbag, Ian goes downstairs. Jamie’s sleeping posture makes Ian believe that she will not wake up even though the earthquake strikes.
	Ian means that his mother will not be woken up until she wakes up naturally, or she will not get up.
	If Jamie hears that, she must be thankful and kiss Ian. What could she ask for more but having such a good son?
	“Your mommy does not need to be woken up by others.” Dan takes his small hands downstairs. They turn around the corner and walk to the dining room.
	“What? What do you mean?”
	“Your mommy always gets up when she's hungry.” As he says this, Dan's mouth twitches.
	Don't ask him why he knows so much.
	It is all because Jamie occupied his bed as a child. And no one can wake her up unless she was hungry.
	Dan will not forget the first time when Jamie woke up, Jamie looked at him and wanted to cry, complaining she was hungry.
	Dan was so angry that he wanted to throw her away. Finally, he sent her home back.
	The next day, the limited edition models he had asked friends to bring back from around the world were all thrown into the pool by Jamie.
	Those models have weight. If they were thrown in the water, they could not be admired any more even if out.
	Dan is a perfectionist so that he will not keep the broken models, even though some of them are left in several sets in the world.
	Then he caught Jamie and hit her ass hard, but finally he was beaten.
	Who beat him? Of cause, it’s Jamie. At that time, Dan’s families were not at home, so Jamie knew that it was no use crying, and then she beat Dan by herself.
	Thinking of it, Dan still feels painful for her claws scratching his face.
	Later, when Jamie woke up, she would see the chestnut cake lying beside the bed, so she cried less of being hungry.
	Dan was not bothered by Jamie any longer, so he kept the habits.
	After a long time, Dan does not care about Jamie’s sleeping habit.
	If he is asked whether he likes Jamie or not, the answer is absolutely, no.
	Because he does not like her but loves her dearly.
	Jamie does not know how Dan loves her. But it does not matter for him. Because he totally believes that she has to accept him one day.
	After meeting Ian, Dan gradually gives up the idea that he will not force her to love him as long as she is happy.
	It’s not his style.
	He thinks that now that he loves her, then he will only love her. He promises that he will not fall in love with others.
	So she has to accept him. Dan thinks that they should go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get a license and that pays no attention to the future.
	Dan sips his fine thin lips, and his eyes flash a look of triumph.
	When Dan enters into the dining room with Ian, Amelia has been there for a while.
	But she looks so tired, with one hand massaging her temples.
	“Don’t you sleep well last night?” Dan goes to touch her head. When Amelia looks up, Dan sees some dark circles under her eyes. It seems that Amelia is so tired that she is unable to open her eyes.
	Ian sits down, looking at Amelia who is sitting in front of him, and feels surprised. Is she the female “ghost”? She looks like Dan, Ian thinks.
	“No, Dan, I saw a ghost last night.” Amelia rubs her temple, trying to make her eyes not so painful, but her beautiful eyes are full of blood. She looks so haggard.
	Even though she turns on all lights in her room, she is still scared. She even wants to call Derek, but after thinking a while, she does not want to leaving a bad impression to Derek, so she gives up this idea. She is so scared that she covers her head with a quilt all night. She did not sleep at all.
	Amelia does not want to suffer that kind of fear any more.
	But she still remembers that little face...
	“Go back your room to take a rest after breakfast.” Dan sits down and says, “Bring up the breakfast, Cindy.”
	“Yes.” Cindy turns to the kitchen. After a while, the servants bring the breakfast to the table.
	Because Dan never eats cold food, and even when the temperature of the food changes, he can taste it. So most of the time, the food will not be bring to the table until Dan sits on the table.
	When Amelia puts down her phone and looks up at the food, she sees Ian sitting opposite her.
	“Oh!” Amelia shouts, pointing to Ian. She does not see him very clearly last night, but when she observes Ian carefully now, it is the person that she met last night.
	“Dan, who is he? It was he who frightened me last night!” Amelia pulls Dan’s sleeve and says hurriedly, but she feels strange when looking at Ian.
	It seems that Amelia meets him before...
	Suddenly, she pounds the table and says, “Dan, Why does he look so like you? !"
	He really looks like Dan as a child.
	So what’s their relationship?!
	Dan puts down the coffee cup he has just picked up, and says, “Let me introduce him to you. He is your nephew, Ian Moore, and his nickname is Bunny. My baby, this is your aunt, Amelia.”
	Ian turns to look at Amelia. Thinking of what Jamie told him last night, Ian Moore understands that it is his aunt who cut his mother’s clothes.
	It means that she does not like Ian’s mother. But what should Ian do?
	“Hello, I am Ian Moore, nice to meet you.” Ian says politely, smiles slightly, and nods toward Amelia.
	“I have a nephew?” Amelia looks at Ian in disbelief. She forgets what has happened last night, just looking at Ian.
	Her brother has such a cute son!
	Her brother is so indifferent, but the boy is so cute and polite. Thus, he must be inherited from his mother.
	
Chapter 151 Ian is Always Welcomed by Ladies
	“I am your aunt, Ian.” Looking at Ian, Amelia goes to sit down next to Ian in hurry.
	Ian Moore keeps smiling, and looks very cute. Amelia squeezes his little face.
	“It’s so soft and cute...” It’s the first time that Amelia squeezes a kid’s face. In fact, she does not like children, especially those dirty kids.
	But when she meets Ian Moore, she really likes him. She enjoys squeezing his little face.
	Ian’s soft little face is a lady killer.
	Ian Moore also does not resist, just keeping smiling.
	“Who is Ian’s mother?” Amelia asks. She thinks that her mother must be very beautiful.
	But why does she know nothing when she was in abroad.
	Amelia feels happy. She thinks that Jamie will not be able to be Mrs. William even though Dan likes her.
	If being not afraid to frighten Ian, Amelia must laugh loudly.
	As long as Jamie is not Mrs. William that any woman becomes Mrs. William does not matter.
	As long as Amelia is here, Jamie will not be Mrs. William!
	Just as Dan says, Jamie feels hungry and gets up. Then she finds that Dan and Ian are not in the room. And she can bear to be hungry to continue sleep, so she gets up to wash.
	The wardrobe is already full of the latest fashionable clothes, and the clothes that has been cut to shreds ware also packed away.
	It should be arranged by Dan.
	Jamie looks at the colorful clothes, and she just picks up one and goes to the bathroom to put it on.
	Jamie walks out of the door with her hair tied up. She just looks down and then hits Cindy when turning at the stairs.
	“Oh!” Without noticing someone coming across, Cindy makes the food that Dan asks Cindy to take to Jamie for her breakfast fall on the floor, with milk pouring out.
	“Cindy.” Jamie is hit back a few steps. She feels sorry to Cindy so that she hurriedly squats down to help her to tidy up.
	“Let me do it. Be careful not to cut your hands.” When Jamie wants to pick up the glass pieces on the ground, Cindy hurriedly stops her, “I go to get a broom, Please don’t pick up with your hands.”
	Jamie claps the dust off her hands, gets up, carefully dodges the glass pieces on the floor and walks to the other side.
	Cindy comes over with a broom and sweeps the glass pieces off the floor. Then she wipes the spilled milk off with a rag, smiles and says sorry to Jamie.
	“I can do it well by myself. And please go down to breakfast.” Cindy takes the tray that Jamie has picked up, smiling.
	“Alright.” Jamie nods, claps her hands, and turns to go downstairs.
	Then, before she comes down, Dan has sent Ian to school. And Amelia goes outside.
	Finishing breakfast, Jamie does not want to stay in the House, and she refuses to be sent by the driver. Thus, she goes out with her bag.
	The House is not far from the road, so that it takes about twenty minutes to get to the road and she takes a taxi to the city.
	She touches the backpack behind her and smiles slily.
	It seems that it is not so bad that Amelia cut her clothes. And even the bag is not so big, but it can hold something that she needs to use in daily life.
	It can be found anything in the House. Thus, when she starts to live there, she brings few things.
	As for Ian, when she finds the ring, she will come back and take him to France, getting far away from here.
	Does she decide to leave here?
	But suddenly, Jamie’s smile disappears, and she feels dazed.
	Is she willing to leave Dan?
	Is she really willing to leave Wendy?
	Jamie does not know the answer, but the figure of Dan comes into her mind.
	His expression of smiling, of thinking, of being angry, of being cold...
	Then, Jamie holds her bag tightly and bites her lips.
	Why does she remember that?
	Shit, why does she think about him?
	She reaches out her little hand and taps her head, being confused.
	“Here we are.” The driver says.
	Jamie recovers from her trance, gives money to the taxi driver and gets out..
	Looking around, at the moment when she is going to shop, her phone rings.
	It is a strange phone number.
	Thinking for a while, Jamie answers the phone finally, “Hello?”
	“This is Amelia.” Amelia replies.
	Jamie is surprised. She asks as she is walking, “What?”
	“I’m at the Time Cafe on Pomelo Street. Come over and let’s talk something.”
	Amelia says in cold and proud tone. She believes that Jamie will come.
	Jamie laughs. Why does she believe that Jamie will come? In fact, she won’t go.
	“No, I just hang up on nothing.” it seems that she wants to hang up.
	“Wait a minute!” Amelia speaks hurriedly, “Just wait a minute.”
	“You have thirty seconds.” Jamie is speaking seriously, like Dan.
	Her speaking is so powerful.
	Amelia angrily hit the table and even Jamie can hear that on the phone.
	“I have something important to tell you, and I believe that it’s worth your coming. If you are curious about it, then come to the Time Cafe.” As soon as she finishes speaking, she hangs up at once.
	After a while, Jamie turns to walk toward the Pomelo Street.
	
Chapter 152 How can She be so Unlucky
	The Time Cafe is not famous, but the reason why Amelia chooses it is that it is lonely and quiet. And the most important is there will be no paparazzi.
	Jamie enters into the cafe, looks around and sees Amelia in dark sunglasses waving at her from a window seat.
	There are few people in the cafe. And the seat near the window that Amelia chooses is really quiet. It is an ideal seat for private conversation.
	Jamie sits across from Amelia with her backpack setting aside. Jamie keeps silent, staring at Amelia.
	Amelia wonders how she can pretend being so calm. Then she says, “Let me tell you that my brother has fallen in love with another woman.”
	Jamie smiles, and replies, “Really? I am always getting together with him all the time. Why don't I know?"
	Then Amelia picks up the coffee cup to hide her guilty conscience. She drinks it slowly and says, “Do you think my brother likes you? But why does he always take good care of Jozo?”
	“Do you think that he really likes you?”
	Amelia asks proudly, just staring at Jamie.
	“You just want to tell me those boring things? Jamie still looks peaceful. She just looks at her cold.
	Amelia frowns, and she does not believe that Jamie can keep peaceful like that.
	"In fact, my brother has never liked you. Being with you is because of your mother.”
	Amelia says slowly, which makes Jamie’s heart broken.
	“What does this have to do with my mother?” Jamie frowns and thinks about what she is told.
	“Well, it seems that you know nothing. Of cause, my brother will not tell you these things.” Certainly, Amelia does not want to tell Jamie any detail, because she gets something from Dan’s computer accidentally.
	But it turns out that Dan does not like Jamie so much, even when they were young.
	“Tell me clearly.” Looking at Amelia, Jamie does not trust her, but she is curious.
	“Why do I tell you?” Amelia continues proudly, “I want you to make sure that my brother will not marry you any more in the future.”
	Because she has a nephew, so she believes that Dan must marry someone.
	Though it is a pity that Dan will not marry Jozo, Amelia still thinks that someone who can beat Jamie must be very good.
	“Do I ever say that I want to be Mrs. William?” Jamie shakes her shoulders. When she looks up, she stares at Amelia seriously, “Amelia, how can you be so naive? Do you really think that everyone takes Dan as a treasure?"
	"You will see whether I marry him, or whether he takes the initiative to marry me."
	Amelia stares at Jamie angrily. Is she naive? How? She hates to be regard as a naive child.
	“Are you kidding?”
	“Yeah. I mean it. If he plans to marry me, then I will agree. And I will fight against you every day.” Then, Jamie goes out of the cafe with her bag.
	The scene is familiar.
	When hearing that, Amelia is so angry that she forgets to turning off the recording on her phone, just staring at Jamie’s departure.
	What does she say?
	Be her sister-in-law? And fight against her every day?
	Now Dan is do fond of her, and if Dan marries her, she will fly to Italy?
	Amelia looks at Jamie’s figure out of the window, thinking that she will not allow her to her sister-in-law.
	With Ian’s mommy here, Jamie will not be Mrs. William.
	When Amelia looks at Jamie’s figure, a car is hurtling toward Jamie.
	This car is...so strange.
	“Be careful!” Amelia shouts, staring at the outside of the window. She sees that Jamie steps aside just in time, but is brushed off and falls to the ground.
	When she walks out the cafe quickly with her bag, she sees a man out of the car carrying Jamie into the car.
	Amelia trots past in high heels, but cafe was a little far away . so the car drives off before she can get there.
	“Are you allowed to go away?!” Amelia stamps her feet and then trots back to drive her car to follow that car.
	But she does not realize that she should be happy but not nervous if Jamie is hit by the car.
	Jamie is sitting in the passenger seat of the Lamborghini, not badly hit, but with bruises, so she feels a little painful.
	She does not know what happens to her recently. Why does she make herself scar? Is it real that no one can have good end if being pride?
	She was so pride just now when talking with Amelia!
	How can she be so unlucky?
	Being so angry, Jamie shakes fiercely that she feels painful.
	She is really unlucky...
	Does she do something wrong? She’s beautiful with sexy body and smart mind. It is a pity that she will be scarred.
Chapter 153 Doctor, My Wife has a Miscarriage
	“Don't move. I'll take you to the hospital now.” Jamie feels painful. And then she turns to look at the man in the driver's seat.
	It is Hooson whom she has never met for a long time.
	“Can you drive? Do you know that you will kill someone through such driving?” Jamie becomes very angry. She is so angry perhaps that they know each other.”
	Hooson touches his nose and says sorry, “I'm sorry, I just rubs my eyes and the car runs off the track."
	He has no idea that Jamie is the only one he hits.
	Is it an opportunity for him to meet Jamie?
	“Shit. You should not drive such a sport car. Does you buy your driver’s license? It seems that someone can do anything with money.” Looking at her chafed wrist, Jamie stares at Hooson angrily.
	Hooson is a little embarrassed, but does not get angry being scolded by Jamie. Instead, he smiles, “You are so smart. It is not easy for me to meet you. Please forgive me.”
	“Do I allow you to call my nickname?”
	In other to meet her, so Hooson hit her?
	Interesting.
	Jamie wants to laugh loudly, but if she laughs, she will feel more painful. She is afraid that the shoulder injury has only just healed and may recur.
	Jamie is not afraid of pain, but of scars.
	It is really hard for girls to accept.
	“I am not...why don’t you believe me?” Every time when Jamie says the word, Hooson feels helpless.
	How does he prove it?
	It is not easy.
	First he needs to have a girlfriend. If he doesn’t have, it is useless to say anything...
	When it arrives at a hospital, Hooson jumps out of the car. As soon as he is picking up Jamie, Jamie looks at him in surprise.
	“Do you think my leg is broken? I can walk by myself.” Jamie stares at him and struggles to walk by herself.
	Hooson does not let her go, but holds her more tightly. Smiling happily, Hooson enters into the hospital carrying Jamie.
	Amelia follows them, and when she sees Hooson carrying Jamie, she takes out the phone and takes some photos furtively...
	“Doctor, help! My wife had a miscarriage!!” As soon as Hooson enters the medical room, he shouts, pushing the people in front of him.
	Those people would have been angry, but give way to Hooson when hearing his shouting help.
	Miscarriage?
	Miscarriage?!
	Jamie is stunned suddenly. She has never seen such a shameless man!
	Who is his wife? Is he trying to insult her?
	Jamie reaches out and pinches his arm, making him cry with pain.
	“Doctor, I am not his wife, but I have something wrong with my leg!” Jamie jumps put from his arms, but she is underestimating her injury, so she can’t stand stably. Fortunately, with the help of the doctor, she does not fall down.
	“Please be careful. What if you get another hurt?” Hooson is very worried and he hurries to hold her hands.
	His words are easy to be misunderstood by people.
	The doctor looks at them reluctantly and says, “Here is orthopaedics. If she has a miscarriage, she should go to gynecology!”
	Oh!
	And those people around them understand the truth.
	“Yes, it's orthopedics. She just got hit by a car. Check her if she has any broken bones.” Hooson seriously looks at the doctor.
	The doctor looks at Hooson scornfully, just like looking at a neurotic patient, "dodn't you see so many people in the back? Get in line!"
	Hooson feels surprised, because he has never thought that the doctor will treat him like that. He has never been asked to get in line in the hospital.
	More importantly, Jamie's injury cannot be delayed.
	“Go to ask the hospital president to come here.” Hooson pats the table angrily.
	“Who are you? If I am not willing to serve you, you have to leave here!” The doctor gives him a contemptuous look, as if laughing at his inability.
	Jamie frowns, bites her lips and talks to Hooson, “Let’s line up at the back.”
	Hooson looks serious and holds Jamie’s hands tightly. Then, he calls someone.
	People around them are interested in their squabbling. They want to see whether the hospital president will come out or not.
	Whether the hospital president can come or not is a real problem.
	“Well, someone likes to pretend.” The doctor is scoffing.
	It seems that the rich man likes to pretend in other to please the girls.
	The hospital is so busy that he will not show up through one calling.
	Two minutes later, the hospital president actually shows up!
	“Mr. Hooson, do you come here to check?” The hospital president anxiously rubs his hands, looking at Hooson.
	What?!
	The doctor has no idea that the hospital president can show up. And the hospital president is not serious but very kind and polite.
	That doctor suddenly feels nervous. Because he thinks that he will lose his job.
	“I bring my friend here to see a doctor, but this doctor is very impolite. Is such the medical ethics of a doctor?” Hooson looks at the hospital president and the doctor, smiling slightly.
	
Chapter 154 What You do to Others will be Done in Turn to You.
	“And...” The hospital president stares at that doctor and blames him seriously.
	Doesn’t he want to quit this job?
	“Mrs. Hooson, bring your friend with me for a thorough check-up...I'll fire him right away!” The hospital president says politely.
	“Hold me, I can walk myself.” With a glance, Jamie stops Hooson picking her up. She limps out after him with her hand on the crook of his arm.
	The doctor stares at them as they walk away. And then he realizes that he is fired.
	In fact, he is very lucky. If he is Dan Moore, he cannot live in the country because of his faults.
	If someone bullies Jamie, Dan will not forgive him.
	When Jamie lies down in the VIP ward that the hospital president arranges for her, Jamie feels upset.
	Last time, Dan took her out of the hospital, but now, she comes back again.
	Is this retribution?
	When can she be a lucky one?
	She looks at her bandaged left knee and other bruises. She still feels a little painful.
	She seems to get hurt easily.
	Someone who gets hurt easily will be more and more stronger through lots of injuries.
	Jamie’s mother has told her, but she did not want to remember.
	However, it seems like a truth.
	She has been so strong that she will not be so sad when Amelia tells her that Dan gets closer to her with some aims instead of loving her.
	She has said that if she can protect herself, then she would be painless even getting hurt.
	Dan is doomed to be the fatal point in her life.
	Hooson enters into the ward, but see Jamie on the bed with a bit of loneliness and sadness.
	Then Hooson feels surprised and seems not to understand her.
	...
	The House.
	Besides Dan’s car, there is also a red ferrari in the parking lot of the villa.
	It is the first time for Amelia not play outside all night. She comes back to the House early with a sense of anxiety.
	The phone she holds in the hand keeps some photos she takes today.
	She knows it is a good chance. If she tells Dan about it, Jamie would have no chance to marry Dan.
	She knows that her brother has a serious cleanliness, including physical and mental.
	What’s more, Dan is cold person and a perfectionist.
	If he knows that Jamie is so close to a man, even though he really likes Jamie, he must be very angry.
	But now Amelia does not know why she will hesitate to take the photo to Dan.
	The villa is very quiet. When Amelia comes back, she sees Dan sitting in the living room, with legs crossed, carrying a cup of coffee which is emitting a curl of heat.
	Dan looks very relaxed, without staring at anything.
	“You come back.” Dan looks up at Amelia who is standing not far from him, smiling.
	Amelia shrugs her shoulders, goes to sit down near Dan, and put the phone on the table. Then she takes one pillow on the sofa in her arms, nodding.
	She has a little guilty whether it is because she sends the photos to Jozo and she does not dare to look at Dan.
	“Don't you want the pink pearls from the auction last time? I've had it sent to your room. Go to see if you like it.” He doesn't notice anything is wrong with her, so he just says softly, setting aside his coffee cup.
	It is said the pink pearl series ending on auction worth 10 million. And it is the most beloved jewelry of the royal princess on Z country. They are pink, glittering and translucent, with 4 pieces altogether.
	Amelia wants to get them when she saw them on TV last time, but they has been taken away. So now Dan pays s high price to get them back.
	In fact, the price must be increase several times, but Dan buys them without any hesitation.
	Of cause, Dan may force the person to sell them to him. Otherwise, Dan can not buy them successfully.
	Being very excited, Amelia shakes Dan’s arms several times and then kiss him, “Thanks. I know you love me most. And I will go to enjoy it.”
	Then she runs towards stairs excitedly.
	She really wants to get the set of jewelry all the time, but Dan does not mention them before, so she thinks that she will not get them anyone. So it is a big surprise.
	Dan smiles. Amelia is his sister, so he must love her.
	He adjusts the posture, bends and wants to pick up the cup of coffee. Then he sees that Amelia’s phone is vibrating. It is Jozo calling.
	Dan picks up her phone, relies on the soft sofa and then looks at the stairs. It seems that Amelia will not come down now.
	Then Dan answers the phone, “Hello?”
	That is Jozo speaking. When she knows it is Dan speaking, she becomes nervous and then replies softly, “Dan, is Amelia not at home?”
	“Yeah.” Dan answers, “What else?”
	Though Jozo knows that Dan is cold, she is still sad. It seems that Dan does not like her at all.
	Perhaps, his tenderness only belongs to his lover.
	
Chapter 155 Master is Childish
	However, has he ever been tender with her?
	Jozo knows that Dan will not talk to her if she does not have such beautiful leg, let alone his tenderness.
	“It’s all right. When she gets back, please let her call me back.” Jozo wants to say a few more words, but she fails to find topics to say.
	“Well, bye.” Dan hangs up the phone.
	At this moment, Jozo seems to feel his tenderness.
	Thinking for a moment, she sends a message to Dan
	“Dan, thank you.”
	Though Dan does not reply her, she is not sad. Because she believes that Dan must see the massage.
	Dan does see it, but he does not reply her. However, he becomes cold when looking at a photo on the phone.
	It is the photo about Jamie and Hooson entering into the hospital.
	It is the photo that Hooson is holding Jamie. Though it can be seen their a profile, Dan can recognize Jamie.
	Dan becomes so angry that his body turns cold.
	However, he still looks peaceful.
	His peace is terrifying.
	After a while, he pretends smiling, but someone can feel his coldness.
	Well!
	If the reason that she does not answer the phone or go home back is getting together with another man, then Dan will not forgive her.
	He stands up and still looks peaceful, but his coldness is terrifying.
	Raising his hands up, he breaks the phone.
	“Derek, go to buy a phone of the same style as this one.” Then, Dan walks out of the villa and goes to the parking lot.
	His every step seems to carry great anger so that the servants do not dare to look up.
	Seldom has he been so angry. Thus it must have something to do with Jamie.
	The black Cayenne rushes out of the House, and speeds toward the hos[ital.
	The traffic police know whose car it is, but turn a blind eye to its violations.
	At this time, Jamie does not know something wrong will happen to her, she still talking with Hooson happily.
	But what they talk about is about sex.
	“In fact, I am not discrimination with, so you really do not have to hide the truth, and I am not the media, so I promise I will keep the secret.” Jamie looks at Hooson seriously, touching his face and sighing.
	He maintains his skin better than her.
	How charming he is.
	Then he is sitting on the bed, peeling an apple for her. When hearing Jamie’s words, he cuts his finger with the knife swinging away, and the finger is bleeding.
	“Well, have you had a bloody accident lately?” Jamie sees that the apple is not stained with blood, so she takes it from his hand and takes a bite.
	“Why are you so unsympathetic? I'm bleeding.” Hooson frowns, puts his injured finger in front of Jamie, and looks for comfort.
	Young master is young master. Can someone die from this little injury?
	Jamie rolls her eyes, moves her calves, and feels numb after lying for a long time.
	Then she takes a bite of the apple and says, “Comparing with all my bruises, you are so lucky. Listen to me, put your finger into you mouth for a while and then you will feel better.”
	What?
	Hooson is confused. It will be better putting the injured finger into the mouth?
	Then, he puts his finger into his mouth. But, as soon as he puts it into the mouth, he spits it out. He shouts, “You lie to me!”
	Jamie happily continues to nibble at the apple and smiles slyly, “You always do what I tell you? Why are you so obedient?”
	“You!” Hooson is annoyed, being deceived by Jamie’s cunning.
	Hooson is annoyed so that he grabs the apple from Jamie and lays it on the table, “ I peel it, and you are not allowed to eat it.”
	Then, Jamie looks at him, and lies down, “ You are so naive.”
	Why are there so many naive rich young Master around her?
	Hooson shakes his head, and continues to peel another apple.
	Suddenly, thinking of something, he says, “Didn’t your father be send to the hospital the other day because of an explosion at your house? It is said that he is in this hospital.”
	Jamie frowns and turns to look at him, “You are very well informed.”
	Few people know about it and it has been covered up by the police.
	“Of course, and I know his ward number. Would you like to see him?”
	“Put me in the wheelchair, and let’s go now.”Jamie points to the spare wheelchair.
	Jamie sits in the wheelchair.
	So they leave her ward and enter into the ward which Jack Moore stays in.
	Jack and Celina are in the intensive care unit. And there must be someone outside the ward in turn. However, Jamie does not find anyone there at that time.
	“I wonder why no one is here...” Jamie rolls her eyes with some confusion. She is wondering why the police is so lax before they check out the truth.
	There was no one.
	They enter into the intensive care unit.
	There are only two beds in the ward, which is worse than the VIP ward. Jack and Celina are lying on the bed in a coma.
	Jamie waves her hands and Hooson lets her go by herself. Then she wheels herself forward a few steps
	Jack and Celina are in a coma. Jack is so weak that Jamie can kill him easily.
	But Jamie will not allow him to die easily. She wants him be painful forever.
	Lay all her mother's sufferings upon him!
	No one can stop her until she has achieved her goal!
	Jamie wheels to see Celina. She stares at Celina coldly who looks pale. She hates them most, but now they are in a coma, so Jamie feels sad.
Chapter 156 Go Back with Me
	She is sad not because of their bitter experience.
	Jack and Celina owe her too much.
	Hooson sees that Jack's hand outside of the quilt, so he goes over to tuck him in, and his body just blocks the pinhole camera.
	After covering Jack with the quit, Hooson looks at the door and says to Jamie, “Let’s go, it is not good to be found by the doctors and nurses.”
	Jamie knows Hooson’s concern. And the reason she comes over is just to see whether they are dead or not. Thus, Hooson wheels her out of the ward.
	When they leave the ward, Jack’s fingers move.
	But Jamie and Hooson do not know, because they are on the way to her ward.
	“Wait.” Looking up at the door, Jamie finds Dan standing there, with her heart beating fast.
	Why is he here?
	She is afraid of being found by him, so she turns off her mobile phone and does not tell Cindy where she goes. But how can he know that?
	There must be something wrong.
	Then Jamie thinks of Amelia. She has never seen anyone but Amelia. It must be she that tells Dan.
	Jamie frowns and does not know what she should do.
	When seeing that Jamie sits in the wheelchair Hooson pushing, Dan feels annoyed and goes closer to Jamie step by step.
	“Go home back with me.” He seems to give a n order.
	“Don’t you see that she gets hurt?” Hooson frowns and stares at him.
	In Hooson’s memory, Dan was born as a king.
	And it is the truth.
	Dan William is really the king of C country.
	So far, no one has dared to fight against him at least, and no one has been able to escape away by betraying or using him.
	He does not only have a handsome face, but also a strong wealth and a gift. He is such a man that is born as a king.
	No one can deny his power in C country.
	And no one can deny that C country will destroy if the country loses him. And in this country, there are countless people who live off his company CR Group and him.
	There are many behind him who envies him for holding the country's destiny in his hands. However, he is really like a king in the fairy tale
	Without exception.
	Hearing what Hooson says, Dan just frowns. He still calms down. It can’t seen any difference about him.
	But Hooson is able to smell something different on him.
	Dan keeps staring at Jamie and looks worried, “What happens?”
	Jamie looks down and she is afraid to be found her sadness by Dan. She is also afraid to be thought of being abandoned.
	But Amelia is right. Dan abandoned her at that time.
	Jamie smiles and tries to pretend nothing severe happening to her. She just looks at Dan, “I am hit by a car, but nothing serious."
	Hit by a car?
	Then Dan turns to look at Hooson, he knows that there must be something with him, or Jamie will not be in the hospital with him.
	Though he’s annoyed, he keeps rational.
	If Jamie does have lover relationship with Hooson, she will feel guilty when see Dan. And Dan can also get it.
	Based on this point, Dan believes her.
	“If nothing serious, then go home back with me.” Dan reaches out his hands, he looks a little kind. And Jamie feels being spoiled.
	She stares at his outstrectched right hand, whose palm is wide. Besides, it can be found a thin cocoon over the knuckles of his middle finger that he has left over from years of pen-reading.
	When did Dan start to sign his name on those important documents with a pen? It was probably the year when Jamie left him.
	In other to forget his pain, he tries to be busy working.
	During that painful period, Dan was even sent to hospital with a stomach hole. And his father was in charge of all his affairs until his families found his madness and numbness.
	When he was well, he continued to work day and night, and no one could stop him.
	The man who could stop him has gone.
	Jamie stares at his palm, being slightly lost in thought. She does not give any respond until Dan’s palm is already on her wrist.
	“I will not go back...” She says lowly, but with stubbornness.
	Actually, Jamie hardly says no to Dan, because she does not dare to refuse him.
	But it is the first time for her to refuse him so directly.
	She just looks down fearfully.
	She even fantasizes that Dan nay not catch her back to the House for their son’s sake.
	However, Dan will not make her dream come true.
	Dan turns around, at the moment when Hooson thinks that he wants to leave, he comes to Jamie’s side, picking Jamie up.
	“Wait, she still has something left in the ward.” Hooson knows that he can not stop Dan, so he gives up. But thinking of Jamie’s something left in the ward, he says.
	But hearing Jamie’s nickname, Dan stops walking, and turns around, “You hit Jamie?”
Chapter 157 What are You Doing
	Actually he does plan to let it go, but when hearing Jamie’s nickname, he stops.
	Hooson nods, looks at him and wonders whether Dan will ask him to compensate...
	Dan smiles, and says slowly, “Then, please pay compensation to her bank card, as for the quantity, it depends on you.”
	Then, He turns and walks to the room where Jamie has been.
	Hooson is surprised that it is the first time for him to meet someone.
	It he pays less, it seems that he is not sincere enough. But if he pays more, it seems that he will have nothing to lose, but the loss is Moon Group.
	Thus, Hooson shrugs his shoulders, and turns away indifferently.
	Dan holding Jamie goes to the hospital parking lot, lays Jamie down on the the deputy driver's seat, and goes back to start the engine to leave the hospital.
	Jamie grimaces. She has not expected to be caught so soon.
	And it must take several days to recover these injuries.
	But, she is unwilling to be caught back there.
	She sighs softly and turns her head to look out of the window. But what she is staring at is not the scenery outside the window, but the face of Dan reflection on the window.
	When looking at Dan, Jamie has to admit that Dan is the kind of person who is born to attract people.
	In all men Jamie has met, including his brother, Dan is the most handsome man.
	No matter how and when she looks at Dan, she is always attracted by his temperament.
	Jamie is not fanatic, but every time when looking at him like this, her heart is pounding.
	Unconsciously she reaches out her hands and traces his outline on the window. She blocks his view with her body.
	Even the eyelashes are outlined
	“What are you doing?” His voice rang out so abruptly that Jamie cannot take her hands back.
	Dan is curious about what she is doing.
	Jamie feels nervous and then thinks that Dan cannot find what she is doing, so she continues to draw on the window, “Nothing, I just help to clean your window.”
	Jamie will not let Dan know that she is doing such a childish thing.
	Then Dan does not answer. He just looks straight ahead. It is dark gradually.
	In this way, the car is moving among the light and darkness.
	“How do you know I am in the hospital?” Jamie says, trying to break such embarrassment.
	Though she knows that it may be Amelia who tells him, she does not know what they can talk about except it.
	“By accident.” Dan answers. Then, the car turns around into the road to the House.
	“Why don't you find five million by accident?” Jamie mutters to herself. She does not believe what Dan says.
	“Why do you get together with him?” Dan frowns. He fails to think of the man’s name, so he does not mention his name.
	Dan never tries to remember some unimportant people, so it is normal not to remember his name.
	Jamie bites her lips. And it can be found anger in her eyes. She says, “I was walking at that time, then his car jumped out and almost hit me, but I dodged quickly or I would be lying in the emergency room."
	Fortunately, her injuries are not very serious.
	Dan listens to her carefully. At this time, he is a little relaxed.
	The car enters into the villa and is parked in the parking lot.
	He goes out first and goes to open the passenger door. Then he leans over, picks Jamie up and goes toward the villa.
	Anyway, it is not the first time for him to hold Jamie, so Jamie is not shy any more. She nestles comfortably in his arms, listening to the powerful beating of his heart from his chest.
	It seems that it is so quiet all the world.
	“Mr. William, it is so good to see Jamie coming back.” Cindy is polishing high-value porcelain that Dan buys it from an auction. When she sees Dan holding Jamie enters into, she goes to greet them.
	Dan just nods, and continues to go upstairs holding Jamie.
	Looking at their happiness, Cindy also feels happy. Then she goes on polishing the porcelain.
	As soon as Amelia goes out from the room, she sees Jamie in Dan. Then Amelia suddenly feels angry, but she can do nothing but only follows them out of the room.
	“Well， it seems that Jamie fails to walk.” Amelia scoffs.
	She does not like Jamie. If the phone is not broken, she is determined to show the photos to Dan.
	There is something wrong with the memory card and the cell phone card when the phone is broken by Dan. Even if they are placed on another phone, there is no way to restore the contents.
	Then Amelia becomes angrier. She misses such a good chance that can help her beat Jamie because of her hesitation.
	In fact, she does not know Dan has known that photos, but Dan is not angry with Jamie. If she knows the truth, Amelia must be very upset.
	Dan lays Jamie gently on the bed, pulls out his hands and gives Jamie a cushion behind her back. Then Amelia is sneering him.
	“I think you should know why Jamie gets hurt in a car accident. Why are you so unkind now?” Dan frowns, looking at Amelia seriously.
	Amelia curls her lip. Actually, she is still afraid of Dan, so she just stamps her feet without saying anything.
	Amelia calms down gradually. However, something happening next makes her completely stunned.
	“Dad, does my mom come back?” Hearing someone coming back, Ian goes to Dan’s room.
Chapter 158 Jamie is His Mother
	Looking at Jamie lying on the back, Ian becomes very happy. Then he runs toward Jamie.
	Amelia looks at Ian’s running. When hearing that Ian calls Jamie mommy, she feels stunned.
	It is as if she has been immobilized.
	“Mom, you come back so late because you go to date with Dad?” Ian looks at Dan seriously.
	He wants to tell Jamie that men outside are unreliable, and that Dan and he are the most reliable, and that they won’t sell Jamie even though they sell themself.
	“What are you thinking about?” Jamie pats his head, kisses him and becomes relaxed.
	Can she tell him that she cannot take him away in other to leave here?
	If Ian is told that, he must cry. Because every time when he is told to be parted, he must cry out.
	Besides, when Ian looks at Jamie piteously, Jamie will be soft.
	In the world, only Ian and food cannot live up to.
	This is his famous quote.
	“Mommy is waiting for you to run away with mommy. How can I run away without you?”
	Hearing that words, Dan looks at Jamie. He knows that Jamie must lie to Ian and that Jamie really wants to leave here.
	But Dan cannot understand why Jamie wants to leave here
	Countless people want to come here to enjoy life.
	Now Dan is emotional. He stares at Ian and seems to think about something.
	“I get it.” Ian kisses Jamie and thinks that he will not run away with his mother.
	Then, Amelia stares at Ian in surprise. After a while, she asks, “Jamie is Ian’s mother?!”
	She couldn't have dreamed it!!
	She has thought of letting Ian's mommy squeeze Jamie out of here. How does it happen?
	“How is Ian Jamie’s ...” It seems that Amelia understands something suddenly.
	Bunny’s real name is Ian Moore, and he says that he takes his mother’s last name.
	And Jamie’s last name is Moore!
	Before Amelia can say anything more, Ian nods and says softly, “Yeah, she is my dearest mommy.”
	Dan snorts softly.
	Ian rolls his eyes and goes to drag Dan’s shirt, kissing Dan, “and he is my dearest dad.”
	Dan smiles, looks happy and kind.
	Jamie feels a little upset because Ian kisses Dan but not kiss her.
	“It is impossible!” Amelia can’t accept what she sees.
	But when she is told that Jamie is Ian’s mother, it means that Jamie is her sister-in-law.
	Thinking of what Jamie tells her in the Time Cafe, Amelia turns around and goes out the room.
	“Dad, what’s wrong with my aunt?” Ian is confused, “She seems to be unwilling to accept the truth that Jamie is my mother.”
	Dan touches his hair, and says, “She just can’t accept it for a while. She likes you very much in fact.”
	“Does she like my son? Interesting. I just hope that she does not give us any trouble.” Jamie says coldly.
	Of cause, Dan knows what Jamie means. Then he answers, “I won’t let her make any trouble, I promise.”
	Does Jamie want to leave here because of Amelia? In fact, it is unnecessary for Jamie to worry.
	With Dan’s promise, she is at ease now.

Chapter 159 the Press Conference
	But Jamie Moore still wants to leave.
	Ian Moore remembers it in heart. He will ask Night.1 to investigate what the woman do for his mother. Otherwise, why Mommy hates the woman to the most.
	"About perfume and clothes. Your drawings have already been given to Moon’s company. After a few days models can try these clothes.” When Dan William finds that she was silent, he says.
	Jamie Moore looks at his eyes with hope, "can I go to the new product conference?"
	"Of course, but your leg have injured. You need at least five days’ recover to walk by yourself, and the conference will be held the day after tomorrow. “Dan William’s words are undoubtedly to ruin her hope.
	She is very confident about this perfume and clothes.
	The leg injury is really untimely!!
	Seeing her unpleasant, Dan William thinks a while and immediately says, "the conference can be postponed, but you can’t go anywhere these days. You must take care of your wounds, or..."
	Later, of course, Jamie Moore knows what’s meaning. Her eyes regain their luster.
	"I see. I'll take care of my injury before I go to the conference!”
	Her eyes are very bright, reflecting into the black eyes of Dan William, shining at the bottom of his eyes.
	"I also want to!” Ian Moore turns around and jumps into the arms of Dan William.
	"No way."
	"No way."
	Dan William and Jamie Moore almost speak at the same time, and even the same words.
	After saying, they are looking at each other with some worry.
	Dan William is worry about if Ian Moore exposes to public, he is afraid there will be some dangerous thing.
	He is afraid that in case of a real accident, it would be too late to regret.
	Jamie Moore’s idea is similar to Dan William, but the other reason is that before she and Dan William have a result, she will not Ian Moore suffer a little injustice.
	...
	Time flies in a flash, it's the day of the new product conference.
	In these days of careful protective from Dan William, Jamie Moore’s injury condition is gradually improved to healthy with Jamie Moore’s own tenacity, even if she suffered any serious injury, she would soon get better.
	Jim Slater told her not to do strenuous exercise.
	But this day, it is Jamie Moore go to the conference alone.
	If it isn't for Jamie Moore to hear that he have a social engagement, she would almost forget that he is also very busy who is also in charge of all affairs of CR, but he always accompanied her and Ian Moore in the Pennies House recently.
	A blessing in disguise, although in Jamie Moore’s recuperation these days, she meets with Amelia, she is safe and sound, and no one asked for trouble.
	Jamie Moore finds that although Amelia hates her, she still likes Ian Moore very much. She will buy any delicious and funny things for him. She often takes Ian Moore out for a walk. It can be seen that she likes Ian Moore from the bottom of her heart.
	For this, Jamie Moore just smiles and doesn’t pay much attention to.
	The venue of the conference is open-air. It is amazing that Moon has covered most of the venue of attacking the garden with a lot of money.
	Next to the conference site is a lake, which is a characteristic landscape of the Garden. No woman has a name even doesn't know who called it nameless. As time goes by, we are used to call it The Lake.
	Some guests enter the site continuously, most of them are women, and some business tycoons accompanying their wife, everyone come here aims at the perfume.
	Jamie Moore is sitting in the backstage lounge and hearing the noisy footsteps from outside. With the delicate voice of women, just listening makes her hands goose bumps.
	Jamie Moore is allergic to perfume, can’t really understand the passion and craziness of these women about perfume. In her view, it is like a flying moths darts into the fire, all of them knowing that they may not be able to get it, but also to toughly fight for it.
	But the perfume really has this charm.
	For beauty, which girl can resist the temptation of perfume?
	So, Moon is catching the point of women.
	Dan William doesn’t come with her tonight. It seems that there is an important social engagement, so there is someone else company with her...
	The door of the lounge was suddenly opened, and Amelia, wearing a pink evening dress, came in from the outside with a beautifully packed bag in her hand.
	Jamie Moore sees the package of the three types perfume that Ryan Jack gave her last time.
	Amelia sees Jamie Moore’s eyes shut in the bag on her hand. She raises chin and straightens her waist. She subconsciously thought that Jamie Moore was envious of her because she is the first one to get the perfume.
	Amelia doesn't expect that she just go out to hang around, and the sales manager of Moon recognizes that she is the sister of Dan William, and then gives a perfume free for her. As we all know, Moon’s perfume is fascinating for women.
	... Except for Jamie Moore.
	Amelia walks to the lounge. On the road there are many people are staring at the perfume box in her hand, which made her vanity burst.
	Now Jamie Moore is staring at her again, and she thinks that Jamie Moore also envied her.
	"See it? This is the main product of the conference. I was the first one to get it!” Amelia put the box in her hand in front of Jamie Moore and sits next to her with proud on her face.
	Jamie Moore lifted her lips lightly with eyes stayed on the box for a while and then turned away, mentioned the first owner of the perfume, she was the first one, which give by Ryan Jack who had just developed this perfume, and all the perfume in the conference are her replica.
	But Jamie Moore doesn’t have the interest to argue with Li Wei, who is the first. Her eyes drooped, listening to Amelia chattering and wishing to speak all the characteristics of the perfume, she has a little speechless.
	If Amelia know that Jamie Moore is allergic to perfume, whether to know she would speak so wonderful.
	After a while, the door is opened again. This time, is Ryan Jack.
	Amelia speaks for a long time, Jamie Moore doesn’t respond. She feel anxious and awkward and take a bottle of perfume out. She was about to spray on Jamie Moore’s body.
	"Don’t spray!” When Ryan Jack sees Amelia’s action, he immediately stops it with a worried and warm voice, which interrupts Amelia’s action.
	
Chapter 160 Dispute
	"Ryan Jack.” When Jamie Moore sees him coming, she says hello with a smile.
	"Jamie Moore, I haven't seen you for a few days. You are more beautiful. “Ryan Jack responds with great familiarity, sitting beside her, pushing forward the box of perfume in front of her.
	Amelia at the bottom of her heart, calling Jamie Moore to attract bees and butterflies, then looked at Ryan Jack with a little dissatisfaction, “why can't I spray? Who are you? Miss Ben? I like it, can you manage it? "
	"This is Mr. Ryan Jack, general manager of Moon. If you do anything disrespectful tonight, he is entitled to drive you out. “Jamie Moore says slowly, with a slight glance.
	Amelia a sudden choking, still feel unwilling to, "dare you? I'll find my brother! “
	"Miss Amelia, don't forget that this is Moon's press conference, not yours. “Ryan Jack frowned slightly, and handsome face have a little unhappy. Obviously, he doesn't have some good feelings for the indulgent and willful Amelia.
	Then he looked at Jamie Moore anxiously. She is with Dan William and would meet her every day, and she didn't look like such a good person.
	Thinking that Jamie Moore would be wronged by Dan William’s side, Ryan Jack's fingers can’t help pinching.
	"So what? Who dares to disobey my brother in the whole country C? “Amelia says again, no matter the tone or the sentence, they are arrogant to the extreme, willful to the extreme.
	Jamie Moore only feels that his temples were all pumping, and his brain is hurting. If she know that would happen she would not have listened to Dan William to bringing her. It was true that every minute can minimize people's tolerance.
	"Can you believe I threw you out before your brother come?” Jamie Moore’s tone is not good. She looks at Ryan Jack with regret, and then says to Amelia.
	"You..."She does not believe that she dared to do so!
	"Would you like to have a try? Or you can bet on me. “Jamie Moore take care of the drapes of his dress, with a soft smile on his lips, as if she is going to stand up and demonstrate and throw Amelia out.
	Amelia's face turn to red, how could she not believe it! Even when her brother is there, she believes that she dares!
	What does her Jamie Moore dare not to do?
	"The press conference has begun. Do you want to go?” Jamie Moore stands at the door, looks back and throw her eye on daze Amelia, sipped his pink lip, and remind her.
	Amelia gets back from her thoughts completely, stands up and arranges her clothes, then arranges her hair. There is a pink pearl hairpin on it, and her earrings, necklaces and bracelets looked like a set.
	"Pink Pearl series?” Jamie Moore whispers that she have seen this set of jewelry on her when she is making clothes for the Royal Princess before, and then the royal family is destroy. It is said that this set of jewelry was lost.
	I don't expect to see it again.
	Amelia doesn't expect that she knows this. She snorts and step on high heels to cross her. "You have vision."
	Jamie Moore smiles helplessly. Dan William really loves his sister. The price of this set of jewelry can't be less than eight figures. It's a big deal.
	In fact, Jamie Moore never envies Amelia, neither before nor now. This is because although the man dotes on Amelia, he dotes on her more, so she never feels that she lacks anything.
	"What do you think? It's about to start. Let's go." Ryan Jack takes her on the shoulder and says softly.
	Those water eyes don't know what they are carrying. They are so bright that they are burning.
	"Good." With a smile, Jamie Moore takes Ryan Jack's arm and walks to the conference hall with him.
	At the same time, the other side of the Garden, entertainment city.
	
Chapter 161 Bitch, How Dare You Kick Me?
	In the hot spring, Dan William and several people originally come to discuss business. After the talks, they agreed to come to the hot spring. In addition, they know that the press conference is on the other side of Garden. Dan William does not rush to leave tonight, and agreed to stay.
	Bruce Hill hugs a beautiful woman by the edge of the hot spring and takes a sip from time to time. When there is wine flowing down the corner of her mouth, the beautiful woman would lean over and lick for him. The picture is not fragrant.
	The other two customers are also holding beauty to soak in the hot spring and enjoy their services. Dan William and Duke Field, without so much interest, soaks in the hot spring to close their eyes and refresh themselves.
	"Why don't President Dan and President Duke call out for beauty? Do you need to call for President Dan and President Duke?” Although these two customers are here to cooperate, they also have a pleased attitude. Moreover, the three families of Dan, Duke and Night are in country C, the power is not small.
	It would be better if anyone could climb this.
	"No need, no use,” Dan William and Duke Field haven't spoken yet, and Bruce Hill rejects them. "I'm afraid Mr. Duke doesn't know, Mr. Dan already has a heart. How can it be regarded as a beautiful woman, as for us not to mention Mr. Duke?" Finish saying, the red wine in the cup on the back of the neck a drink, liquor down the neck slide, enchanting evil charm.
	"Well, I don't know which one is so lucky that he has received so much mercy."
	Dan William doesn’t even look at them. He closes his eyes, the whole person exudes a faint elegant spirit, convergence of the fierce and hostile he, at this moment, handsome confused people, said is evil is not too much.
	Fortunately, not fortunately, it depends on the person's thoughts, otherwise what is the use of others?
	Manager Sun, who do not get a response, fells a little embarrassed, drained the wine, smiles apologetically at them, and goes up to the bathroom.
	Halfway through the press conference here, Jamie Moore comes to the stage to explain the design inspiration of these clothes and then steps down, accepting those people to come to toast, she don't drink well, and after a few drinks, she couldn't stand it, so she excuses herself and goes to the bathroom to escape.
	After drinking, Jamie Moore’s head is dizzy. Fortunately, there is still a little consciousness, and she could barely find a way.
	In addition, Dan William always brings her here, so she is still very familiar with it.
	The cool night breeze blows Jamie Moore’s head awake, but it is useless, still a little dizzy, and she thinks it is okay to wash her face.
	Garden is very large, but the bathroom is in the center, although there are other places, but the dizzy Jamie Moore has too little time to think, and goes directly to the bathroom in the middle.
	After washing her face, Jamie Moore’s small face is wet, and she walks out of the bathroom. The pace is already a little messy, and she walks crookedly. One do not notice, actually went in the opposite direction to the venue.
	After walking for a while, she feels a little difficult to support, closing her eyes against the wall, probably because of drinking, the whole face is hung with a layer of pink, which looks extremely charming.
	Her appearance has attracted many waiters to stop, but without the courage to talk up, the rules of Garden are very strict.
	But they do not dare to talk up, which does not mean that others do not dare.
	Manager Sun comes out of the bathroom and is about to return to the hot spring. With a glance at the corner of his eyes, he sees this breathtaking picture, and his eyes are straightened!
	Now in this society, what kind of women do not have, and like these people who have more heads and faces in business, countless women climb on their couches.
	Beautiful, really beautiful!
	Mr. Duke, who has a big heart, and just drank a little wine, walks towards Jamie Moore with a rush in his head.
	Jamie Moore is resting with her eyes closed for a while, and then she feels a hand climb on her face, and immediately let her open her eyes, flashing aside with a strong reaction.
	"What are you doing?” Jamie Moore raises her eyebrows in disgust, and the blushing face of the drunk is particularly attractive, especially the eyes that have passed the water, clear and flowing, and intriguing.
	Manager Sun is agitated immediately, and his body reacts immediately, watching Jamie Moore’s eyes warmer, "Don't be afraid of beauty, I'm not a bad person, as long as you follow me obediently, you will give you everything!"
	Jamie Moore gives him a cold look, her red lips slightly raised, and spit out a few words, "No need!"
	The man's gaze makes her feel sick, and she turns away when she thinking.
	"Eh, don't go, beauty!” Manager Sun is anxious when he sees that she was leaving, and quickly grabs her wrist. "Don't you want glory and wealth? I can give you whatever you want, as long as you follow me! "
	Jamie Moore shakes his hand away in disgust, but because of drinking, her strength is not as strong as usual, and the head is like a ball of paste, so uncomfortable, so she lifts her foot without thinking, kicking Mr. Duke.
	Manager Sun is kicked at the key part by her, and his face suddenly turns to pig liver, and he stares at Jamie Moore with a look of fierceness. "Bad woman, how dare you kick me?"
	When he says it, he would pull Jamie Moore’s wrist, "You are willing to be willing and unwilling to be willing today, and the women I love, not many can run away!"
	Jamie Moore is upset because of drunkenness and is lack of mental strength. He isn’t so powerful after being pulled by him, but the consciousness tells her that if she is taken away, she would be over.

Chapter 162 Brother Dan
	But she isn??t in Pennies House and also isn??t under Dan??s sight, and he goes to business today. There is some distance from the venue of the conference. Who is gonna save her?
	Jamie is unwilling and lifts her foot to kick him again.
	However, Manager Sun is smarter this time.
	He takes Jamie??s raised calf and touches it, with a grinning and evil look, "Bitch, I will conquer you later!"
	He drags Jamie while saying. But she is reluctant and uses her fingers to fasten the wall to resist with a weak face.
	Bruce was originally in the hot spring. His female companion suddenly said that she wanted to go to the restroom. He immediately knew it, so he held her and walked towards the restroom.
	But as soon as he gets to the door of the restroom, he notices a familiar figure.
	"Jamie??? Bruce is a little surprised to see her, and he realizes that Manager Sun has just forcibly taken her away. He feels anxious at once and wants to go over to stop it.
	Something is wrong!
	He suddenly reminds of something, stopping and reaching for his female companion, "Give me the phone."
	A mobile phone is put on his hand. He hooks his lips, considering that it is gonna be interesting later. Then he calls Dan.
	After five seconds, the phone is connected, with Dan??s slightly lazy and casual voice, "Hello?"
	Bruce grins, and then his face changes and his tone also becomes anxious. "Bro, it's really terrible! Jamie is being bullied by a man who will take her away if you don??t come here right now!"
	Before he finishes speaking, he hears a loud noise of water over there, accompanied by Dan??s slightly anxious voice, "Give me the site!"
	"The restroom next to the hot spring! Come on... ??Before the words are finished, the phone has been hung up. Bruce smiled. Look, he has done a good matter again.
	He looks at Manager Sun who is trying to take Jamie away, but she refuses to obey. Bruce is thinking about why Dan hasn??t come while he turns around and Dan is passing by.
	"Bro!"
	It's really fast. Just in two minutes.
	Dan passes him without a sight and walks quickly towards Jamie.
	"Bitch! How dare you disobey me? Believe it or not, I will rape you right now!?? No matter how Manager Sun grabs and drags, Jamie is slamming the wall. Fortunately, the wall is not very slippery, otherwise it will not be enough for her to support so long.
	She would rather die than being taken away!
	Jamie??s head becomes dizzy and swollen, and she can't hold it anymore. At this time, a big and powerful hand grabs her hand which is clasping the wall, and pulls her into his arms with a force.
	It is her familiar mint aroma, which inexplicably makes him feel at ease.
	"What did you say just now?" Dan??s voice is very low, but full of coldness. A bit of anger is emerging from his eyes, and he looks at Manager Sun as if he was going to slap him.
	Manager Sun doesn??t expect that Dan would appear at this time, and he also pulls the beauty he fancies into his arms. More seriously, the two seems to know each other!
	Manager Sun suddenly becomes sober, and he is shivering. He does not dare to look at Dan, "Manager Dan, this woman wants to seduce me, so I can't hold it..."
	Seduce?
	Dan hooks his lips coldly, and gives a glance at Jamie who seems to be drunk as her face is red, her red lips are slightly open and her eyes are blurred.
	But if she seduces someone, the man must be him! What the hell is this man?
	As long as he thinks he dares to touch his Jamie, he wishes to kill him immediately!
	Jamie comfortably rubs the chest of Dan, and she is dissatisfied when she hears the words of Manager Sun. The drunken lady is doing something that she would never dare to do when she is sober.
	She cuddles the neck of Dan, and her red lips are only one centimeter away from his face. She is flirting arrogantly, "Brother Dan, he said he would take me to rape me, and he bullied me!"
	Her voice is ringing in his ears, and the little hand clinging to his neck seems boneless. While the word she said drives him crazy.
	He seems to hear the ??Brother Dan?? after a century.
	At this moment, Dan realizes that everything is all right...
	When Manager Sun hears Jamie??s words, he is totally tense. Did this woman call him Brother Dan? Is she his sister? He has just provoked Dan??s sister!
	Manager Sun??s face becomes pallid and he looks at Jamie and Dan palely but finds that there is a rare spoiling and softness in Dan??s eyes mixed with countless love. Manager Sun is shocked to see that.
	"Which hand did he touch you exactly??? Dan raises his eyes and scowls straightly at Manager Sun.
	"Well... it seems to be the left hand... oh no, the right hand... ??Jamie cannot remember it, leaning on Dan??s chest and squinting his eyes, "I hate him for touching me!"
	"Okay...."Dan??s black eyes is narrowing dangerously, and then he takes Jamie to step forward and glares at Manager Sun coldly.
	Just when Manager Sun is wondering what Dan gonna do to him, his right hand is suddenly grasped by Dan, and then Dan turns hard. His bones are misplaced with a clatter.
	Manager Sun shouts in horror. The tingling from his wrist has not been alleviated, and he notices that Dan has grabbed his left hand and breaks his left hand just like that.
	The action is fast and accurate, and Manager Sun's two hands are broken!
	But Dan feels that it is not enough. He lifts his feet to kick Manager Sun's legs and obese body to the front making a muffled noise when Manager Sun lands. Then he faints.
	Bruce behind is about to applaud. He believes it is definitely right to call his brother!
	"Derek, throw him out. You are no longer allowed to step in here. ??Dan says to Derek. Then he takes out a handkerchief and wipes his hands for Jamie, and then he wipes himself and throws it into the trash can.
	Derek appears quietly, and he picks up the fainted Manager Sun and leaves quickly.
	"Brother Dan, just hold me and leave. ??Jamie refuses to loosen the hands in Dan??s neck. Perhaps she is greedy for the warmth of him. In short she is reluctant to let it go.
	Dan??s condensed eyes instantly become very tender. He picks her up and turns to walk.
	When passing by Bruce, Dan stops and glances at him slightly, "There needs a manager in a branch. Go back to pack up and enjoy for a few days there."
	After talking, Dan walks away with holding the girl. What??s more, his back seems to show tenderness.
Chapter 163 Heartache
	What?
	Bruce Hill's phone suddenly hits on the ground. He turns around quickly and looks at Dan William??s back with a bitter face. He almost jumps up.
	"You are enough! You don't thank me but retaliate me?! Unfair! "
	Bruce Hill's roar can be heard within a ten-mile radius.
	Duke Field comes and asks, ??What??s the matter? Have you offended brother again???
	When it comes to this, Bruce Hill is full of grievance, "Don't mention it, brother must be revenge me for I don't save little Jamie at the first time. Don't say anything."
	Dan William says that he can go to play for a few days, but he knows very well that he will not let him come back.
	He won't be like him for a few days. Who will recognize him when he comes back?!
	"Let it be. ??Duke Field doesn't know how to comfort people, so she can only say that.
	"Brother has no conscience. Have a wife, don't need a brother. I have no credit but hardship!?? Bruce Hill beats his chest and kicks his feet. Without him, can Dan William save the beauty!!
	It's a pity that Dan William has gone far away with Jamie Moore in his arms, and can't hear his roar.
	Dan William takes Jamie Moore to the room he temporarily orders by Derek William. He originally plans to go back to the manor, but considering Jamie Moore, they can only stay here.
	He puts Jamie Moore on the soft bed, taking the air conditioner remote control to lower the temperature, and asks someone to bring an ice towel to wipe her face.
	Her little face is hot, the skin exposes outside the dress is light pink, and her red lips are breathing slightly, which is particularly charming.
	Dan William just wants to get up and puts the bath water for her, but she grabs his collar and pulls it back. They almost lip to lip.
	Her eyes are blurred, as if to identify him.
	Dan William, who has no resistance for her, feels that when he looks at her eyes, his belly is hot, his black eyes becomes dark and deep, and the fire of making love is kindled.
	"Jamie, let go." His voice is low and dumb, he wants to stand up and leave immediately, but he is afraid of hurting her. His body presses on her, and he can feel the abnormal temperature of her body.
	"No." Jamie Moore??s wet eyes turn and look at his face and suddenly smile, "Dan, do you love me?"
	Dan William doesn't expect that she will ask him so directly. He is pleasantly surprised that she finally opens her mind and he doesn't intend to deny it. She is about to open her mouth, but is interrupted by Jamie Moore.
	"But why do you do that to me? Have you ever loved me?"
	Jamie Moore??s words are like needles stuck in Dan William??s body. He pinches his lips and reaches for her hair.
	His eye light is deep, mixing with helplessness.
	What he does for her is that she can't see it or doesn't want to see it. Why can't she feel his heart?
	"Jamie favorite Dan William, doesn't want me, doesn't want my child, why... ??It's only when she is drunk that she dares to yell at him and question him.
	In daily life, Jamie Moore is cunning and calm. How can she will coquettish to Dan William?
	So this coquetry of her, Dan William only feels that the things in his chest are going to melt into a pool of water.
	But what does she just say?
	Don't want her? Don't want her children?
	How is this possible?
	When does he say that? Why doesn't he know?
	Dan William raises his eyes to look at Jamie Moore and sees that the delicate and elegant little face has tears on it.
	Dan William??s breathing is sluggish, and his heart feels as if it has been torn but with a burst of joy. Looking at the small face full of tear stains, he is a little relieved.
	Jamie Moore??s low EQ doesn't mean Dan William??s EQ is low. On the contrary, his EQ has always been high.
	Hearing from the words that Jamie Moore has just said, he knows Jamie Moore is crying for him. In this case, it proved that she always has him in her heart.
	With this idea in his mind, Dan William leans over her face, gently licks the tears on her face, and the thin lips move to the delicate and dripping lips, tossing and turning.
	Just as he is about to take the next action, suddenly, Jamie Moore uses both hands and feet, pushing him down with her force!
	At that time, Dan William doesn't notice then is pushed under the bed by her. He is looking at the little woman who is sitting on bed with a silly smile. Then she snorts heavily, and falls on the bed and sleep.
	"Oh! Shit." He stands up. There is still fire in his body. He takes a few steps up, picking up Jamie Moore??s body, shaking it a few times, and stares at her with some gnashing teeth, "Jamie Moore! Get up! "
	Damn it, pick up his fire and let him aside, this damned woman!
	Jamie Moore is really asleep, no matter how can he shake and roar.
	With a sigh of chagrin, Dan William let go of the hand holding her shoulders with some frustration. She is the only one who dared to do this to him!
	He stands up, walking towards the bathroom. Quickly, there comes the sound of water. Dan William stands under the shower and allows cold water to pour on him, but it takes a long time to extinguish the residual fire in his body.
	After about half an hour, Dan William dresses a hotel bathrobe and walks out of the bathroom.
	There comes a slight music, one after another, it seems there is no end.
	
Chapter 164 Password
	He glances across the room, and then he stares at the place where Jamie Moore lies. Then he finds that there is a white cell phone under her arm.
	It seems that Jamie Moore is annoyed by the music. She touches the bed, and then she finds the phone. She picks the phone up, and then she throws the phone to the ground carelessly.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he raises his arms to catch the phone that Jamie Moore throws accurately. He looks at the screen. The music has stopped. But the phone rings again a few second later.
	It's a ringing music, and it’s Ryan Jack who calls Jamie Moore.
	What does he want to do?
	Dan William frowns, and then he kicks on the phone. Then he answers the phone in an indifferent way, "Hello?"
	Ryan Jack is worried about Jamie Moore, but he never expects that Dan William would answer the phone of Jamie Moore. And then he asks, "Does Jamie stays with you?"
	"Jamie?" Dan William's eyes are cold. He looks at Jamie Moore who is still sleeping. Now Jamie Moore looks like a child who always lives a happy life. Seeing here, Jamie Moore is in a trance.
	It seems that they have returned back to the old days. It seems that nothing has changed.
	The eyesight of Dan William becomes soft suddenly, but he still says in a cold way, “She is sleeping very well now, so don't bother her."
	Sure enough, Jamie Moore stays with him.
	Ryan Jack holds the phone tightly, and then his face becomes very cold, “Well, I won't disturb you. Please take good care of her, Mr. William."
	"Well." After saying this word, Dan William hangs up directly.
	Ryan Jack signs, and then he walks to the conference hall.
	In fact, this conference is the clothing conference of Jamie Moore. He prepares this well for Jamie Moore. He intends to take this opportunity to show his love to her, thus she may become his girlfriend.
	Fortunately, the moral behind it has not yet been revealed, and he may have chance.
	After Dan William hangs up, the cell phone shows a lock screen, which requires a password to enter. He looks at Jamie Moore, and then he sits on the sofa. He tries to find the password of the phone.
	He tries the password with the birthday of Jamie Moore and him, and the birthday of Ian Moore, but all is not right.
	Dan William stares at the screen of the phone, and then writes a few numbers at will, but he still doesn’t untie the phone.
	Dan William doesn’t give up for this. Instead, he has more courage to do this.
	The harder the password, the more important it is to Jamie Moore.
	But does it good to check her privacy in such a way?
	However, Dan William only hesitates for a few seconds. Then he snorts. They even have a child. What's wrong with it? Soon she will be his wife. What's wrong with the husband looking at the phone of his wife?
	Thinking of here, Dan William continues to look at Jamie Moore’s phone without any guilty.
	What Jamie Moore sets is a digital password, but it doesn’t display the number of digits set. Thus Dan William guesses whether she would use the combination of her birthday and others.
	Dan William tries the birthday of Jamie Moore and him, but it fails.
	Then he tries the birthday of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore, and then the screen is unlocked!
	He slides the phone with his figure constantly. He is looking at the picture, and it is divided into several groups. One of which is all the pictures of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore. Each one is taken well, and all of picture is taken with a good angle. It looks like art pictures.
	There are many photos of Ian Moore, which is from baby to now. He looks at the number of on the top. There are more than 1000 picture. The picture of Ian Moore accounts for 80%.
	The picture all records the five years that he missed, and it’s all about the life of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore.
	Each one is a precious treasure for him.
	He blames Jamie Moore in his heart. If Jamie Moore doesn’t leave away with Ian Moore, how could he miss the five years of growth time of Ian Moore?
	He looks at the picture, and then he finds a video. He clicks it. It’s Jamie Moore who records the video. In the video, Ian Moore just learns to walk. He gets up from the ground in the video, and then walks a little bit forward with unsteady steps. Seeing here, Dan William feels that his heart would follow his steps, for fear that he would fall.
	Ian Moore in the video falls down when Dan William thinks. Fortunately, he falls on the bed, and the bed is soft, thus it will not hurt him.
	Then Jamie Moore’s voice comes from the video. Jamie Moore says in a very soft way. It’s a gentle encouraging voice that Dan William has never heard before. It’s like a breeze, and it could make people feel refresh from the heart, "Honey, stand up and try again…Baby, you are the best!"
	Ian Moore is very competitive. He stands up in a few minutes. He walks to Jamie Moore in an unsteady way. And his face is carved with a touch of innocent joy.
	Then Ian Moore says in a vague way, "Mommy...Daddy…"
	Dan William is shocked, and his heart seems to be shocked by something. He backs up the video, and the video returns back to the place where he has just seen, and he listens to it again.
	It’s true that Ian Moore calls Daddy after calling Mommy.
	His baby, unexpectedly, still remembers his daddy…
	His eyes gradually become warm, and his phone almost falls to the ground because of surprise.
	It’s very lucky that he unlocks the lock screen of Jamie Moore's cell phone. He sees the secret of the picture. Although he doesn't participate in the past five years, now his empty heart is expanding and satisfying rapidly…
	
Chapter 165 Sense of Security
	All of a sudden, he feels that nothing is more important than Jamie Moore and his son.
	Although Ian Moore is not close with him now, Dan William knows that Ian Moore will accept him with the time goes. Then he will make up for all the five years he has not participated in.
	He takes out his cell phone, and then he transfers all the pictures in the gallery of Jamie Moore's cell phone to his cell phone with Bluetooth, and then he saves them well. He also adds a password lock after thinking for a while.
	The password he uses is the birthday of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore. He relieves after doing all of this.
	Dan William puts his phone down, and then he walks to the bed. He stares at the sleeping face of Jamie Moore, and then he lies on the bed. He opens his eyes, and he doesn’t fall asleep.
	It’s a very peace night.
	At the end of the conference, all of the people presented grab a set of perfume. All of them leave with a smile, and they all satisfy with the result.
	Originally, Amelia wants to go home with Jamie Moore. But Jamie Moore leaves her alone, thus she feels more uncomfortable in her heart.
	She leaves the meeting room with pride before the conference is over.
	Ryan Jack sits by the lake. He looks at the boundless night. Several staffs are cleaning up the scene behind him, which is a big contrast with him.
	It’s in the midnight. He could feel the cold wind, but he doesn’t feel cold.
	"She leaves in the middle of the way, which is a waste of your efforts. Are you disappointed?" The voice suddenly sounds behind him, and the man says behind him.
	"What she likes is that person. Even if you arrange it carefully, she won't care it." The voice is very cold, so Ryan Jack shivers even he doesn’t feel cold.
	"So what?" He raises his eyes and looks at the distance.
	The face of Ryan Jack is very cold, but he still says in a soft way, “I love her, so I am willing to do everything for her. There is nothing to do with her."
	"Right?" The voice is a little disbelieving, and then he says indifferently, "It's up to you. Anyway, I know that you can never be accepted by her if you use her so much."
	"She will never know it." Ryan Jack says lightly.
	Then the man behind him doesn’t say anything.
	The next morning, in the room to the west of the Garden.
	When Jamie Moore wakes up, her head is still a little dizzy because of the hangover. Her head is as heavy as there is lead in her head. She rubs her eyes to see the scene in the room.
	It seems that it’s a room in the Garden. But why is she here?
	She is a little confused. Then she gets up, and stands barefoot on the cold milky marble floor. She looks around, and then she finds that there is a man's coat and a thin black mobile phone on the sofa.
	She picks the men's coat up, which exudes a light mint fragrance. Thus she reminds Dan William suddenly.
	There will be no one but him.
	Jamie Moore frowns. She looks at his coat and thinks. She remembers that she is almost taken away by a man when she comes out of the bathroom yesterday. Then it seems that Dan William appeared, and then she doesn’t remember anything…
	She shouldn't have done anything wrong, would she?
	Jamie Moore is very clear about the drinking capacity of her. She is skeptical about her behavior after she is drunk.
	Maybe she has offended him.
	Jamie Moore laughs. Is she like that?
	Dan Willian walks into the room when Jamie Moore is thinking something. Dan William just wears a black shirt with black trousers. He puts one hand in his pocket, and he walks into the room calmly and gracefully with a plate in his hand.
	He frowns when he sees Jamie Moore stands on the ground barefoot. Thus he says, “What are you doing? Why don’t you wear shoes? Go back to bed quickly?"
	Jamie Moore looks down at her feet. She doesn’t feel it. But when she hears Dan William’s words, she feels cold suddenly. Thus she walks to the sofa and sits down.
	This is the safe place. If she runs away, Dan William will be unhappy. If he throws her out, what should she do? If he asks money from her, what should she do?
	
Chapter 166 What did you Want to do with Me?
	In fact, she really thinks more about it. Last night, it’s true that Dan William has that meaning, but she really has a bad capacity for liquor. She falls asleep before Dan William wants to do something. Dan William calls her for several times, but she doesn’t wake up.
	Dan William puts the plate in front of her and sits next to her. He is so handsome, thus Jamie Moore almost attracts by his face.
	What in the plate is the breakfast prepared by the Garden. Considering that Jamie Moore drinks too much last night, thus Dan William ask somebody to prepare a bowl of sobering tea for her.
	"You should drink this first, and then you will be sober than now.” Dan William hands the sobering tea to her with dark eyes and light complexion. It seems that nothing has happened.
	Jamie Moore shivers in her heart. The sobering tea on her almost falls on the ground. It’s lucky that she holds it in time.
	But now she doesn’t know the thinking of Dan William. How could she find the idea in his heart?
	Since she doesn’t know the thinking of Dan William, how could she know the action she did last night?
	Is the fact that she did something wrong last night? Thus Dan William wants to throw her away after feeding her.
	Dan William shivers. She looks at Dan Willian, and then swallows saliva. She drinks the sobering tea under his gaze. Then she finds Dan William hands a porcelain bowl to her, which is hot chicken porridge.
	Dan William doesn’t do anything to her after she eats the porridge. Instead, Dan William takes a glass of milk to her gently.
	At last, Jamie Moore couldn't help it. She looks at Dan William in a firm way, and asks, “Dan William, now you could tell all things to me. If I did something wrong tonight, thus you wants to poison me."
	Dan William’s face changes, and then he presses his lips. Then he stretches out his fingers and flicks them on her forehead. "Did the donkey kick you head? Don't you see I treat you in a fine way? "
	Jamie Moore covers her forehead and looks at him with big eyes. She glares at him discontentedly, "You head have been kicked by the donkey!"
	Wait, what did he just say?
	Does he treat her well?
	Jamie Moore is shocked. She looks at Dan William as if she is looking a monster. She can't believe it. Does the sun rises in the north and sets in the south? How could he want to be nice to her?
	Even so, Jamie Moore’s face turns red suddenly, "Why are you so nice with me? Have I did something bad to you last night?"
	Hearing that Jamie Moore mentions last night, although the face of Dab Willian doesn’t change, the eyesight of Dan William becomes cold. No man has self-control in front of the woman he liked.
	But last night, Jamie Moore not only leaves him there alone, but also she sleeps like a dead pig. How could he not be angry?
	He narrows his eyes, and then he looks at Jamie Moore. And then he says with a smile, "What did you do to me?"
	His voice is full of irresistible momentum. He says in a lazy way, but his eyes are full of dangerous.
	He puts his hand on Jamie Moore's neck, and his smile is as light as ever, but he walks to Jamie Moore with a strong momentum.
	It’s true that she did something bad to him!
	Jamie Moore wrinkles the delicate face of her. Originally, she thinks she is lucky enough. But now, it seems that she really did something bad to Dan William, thus Dan William is so angry.
	Will he strangle her?
	Jamie Moore is afraid, and she looks at Dan William who walks close to her, and then she bites her lips. Now she is very nervous.
	"What did I do to you last night..." Jamie Moore is a person who will ask when she misunderstands something. Obviously, she doesn’t realize that Dan William's face is even colder.
	Last night. Last night. How could she mention last night to him?
	Now he wants to rip off her trousers and beats her up!
	"If you continue to mention last night, I will throw you out. Do you believe me?” Dan William says in a threat way. Damned woman, if she continues to mention the thing happened last night, he will rip off her trousers and do the thing that should be done last night!
	Jamie Moore still wants to say something, but she stops after hearing Dan William’s word. And then she looks at him.
	She lowers down her head, and then she finds the clothes on her body have been changed. It isn’t the clothes she wears yesterday!
	"Where are my clothes?" She looks up in amazement and frightened way. "Who changes my clothes?"
	It's better not to be Dan Willian!
	Otherwise, she is afraid that she would kick his face uncontrolledly!
	Dan Willian looks around and then he looks at the other place of the room, and says, “You are vomiting in the middle of the last night, and you are dirty. If it wasn't for me, how could you sleep so comfortably?"
Chapter 167 An Improper Thought
	This is true. In the middle of the night, Dan William sleeps with Jamie Moore in his arms, and Jamie Moore vomits all the time. Though she vomits to the ground, she also vomits some on his body!
	Finally, Dan William has to take her to take a shower, and then changes clean clothes for her. Fortunately, she doesn't vomit again.
	However, it is still a tough time for Dan William. The beauty is right in front of him. He can only watch but can't eat. He almost suffers internal disease for this. Finally, he takes a shower with cold water for half an hour to get relief of this.
	And how about Jamie Moore?
	She feels more comfortable after vomiting. Thus she sleeps very well.
	Last night, it’s really a hard time for Dan William. He needs to take a cold shower in the middle nigh. What’s more, he can’t do anything to the woman he loved, even though the woman sleeps beside him. Although this is not the style of Dan William, Jamie Moore looks not very good at that time. This is the reason why Dan William is willing to suffer suffering.
	Because he loves her very much, thus he is willing to suffer suffering, and he is now willing to let her suffer suffering.
	But Jamie Moore, who always lacks mind, will never know this. She feels bad when she hears the word of Dan William. His face becomes redder than before, and it just likes ripe peach, which attracts other people. Because she is too shy, thus her whole body is covered with pink. Now she looks very attractive under the indoor light.
	She feels bad when she find he has seen all the body of her.
	It’s true that this takes advantage of another’s perilous state!
	"Can't you let the waitress change it for me? Or you could throw me on the ground! Do you want me to be responsible for you?" Jamie Moore says clearly.
	There is waitress here, thus he doesn’t need to do this by himself.
	Dan William blinks slightly. In the fact, the reason he doesn’t let waitress comes in is that he doesn’t want other people see her body. Only he could see her body!
	Even other woman can see her body!
	He is such a domineering man!
	"What? Are you shy? Or do you have an idea about me?" Dan William is much more shameless than Jamie Moore.
	"Who has an improper thought on you? Asshole, my innocence is gone!" Jamie Moore is so angry that she wants to pick up a grape from the fruit plate and then throw it to his face. But then she reminds that the taste of grape is good, thus she puts gape in her mouth.
	The taste of grape is very good. He doesn’t deserve this!
	Dan William is very calm, and then he puts the things on the table. He leans against the sofa, and then he looks at Jamie Moore, and says, “Your innocence is given to me as early as five years ago, or how could we have a son?"
	The implication is that, anyway, your innocence has belonged to me, and it's has happened long time before.
	Jamie Moore stares at him angrily. It seems that her eyes are full of star. And then she finds Dan William’s word is right. If the innocence of her is still there, where is Ian Moore from?
	Bah!
	It’s not right!
	She feels that it’s very strange!
	"Be quiet! Don't forget that we don’t have any relationship now. It's illegal for you to do so!" Jamie Moore says angrily, and then she sits away from him immediately.
	There is a sense of cherishing life and staying away from Dan William.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he looks at her coldly. He doesn’t care about her action. He picks up the milk Jamie Moore drinks, and then takes a sip of it. Then he says proudly. "Do you want to talk law with me? Don't forget that I am the law in Country C!"
	"You are oppressing people with power!" Jamie Moore says.
	"I am willing to do this." Dan William continues to drink, and then he puts down the milk cup. He looks at Jamie Moore, and the slightly ambiguous action just now makes him look more enchanting.
	If Jamie Moore can beat him, she will bite him heavily!
	"Don't forget it, and you are my child's mother, and you are my wife in the future. If you are not satisfied with our current relationship, I'm willing to change it." He goes on, and it seems that he is in a good mood.
	"Don't think about it!" Jamie Moore says hurriedly. "It's good now, and there's no need to change it!"
	Marry him? This is a question that Jamie Moore can’t think.
	The atmosphere in the room becomes silent because of the words of Jamie Moore. It’s so quiet that you even could hear the voice of the needle on the ground.
	Then the mobile phone of Dan William rings suddenly. He looks at the screen, and his eyes suddenly become dark. No one know his thinking, but the stiff face of his face becomes soft than before.
	"Hello? …Well, where are you? I'll go now…OK. Please wait for me." Dan William hangs up after saying a few words. He takes his coat from the sofa, and then put the mobile phone in his coat pocket.
	"I have something else to do. Derek William will send you back after you have breakfast,” Dan William looks down at her. Jamie Moore lowers her head, thus Dan William only could see her head.
	"No, I can go back by myself." Jamie Moore says in a muffled way, and she doesn’t look at him.
	She doesn't know what happens to her. It’s her who doesn’t want to marry him. But she feels uncomfortable when Dan William treats her so cold.
	Does the menstrual period of her come?
	Jamie Moore calculates and then she finds it is not the menstrual period of her.
	She doesn’t know the reason of this. Then the cold voice of Dan William comes, “It’s up to you.”
	Then he walks to the door, and opens the door, and then leaves.
	Jamie Moore relieves, and then she falls down on the bed. She turns over and puts her face on the soft pillow. We only could see her eyes, and then she looks at the front in a daze.
	She checks carefully before she leaves the room. She always did this. She is very serious.
	After checking, she finds that nothing has fallen, so she goes out of the room, and closes the door. She puts her hands in the pocket of her coat, and then walks forward.
	Dan William blinks when he walks out of the Garden. He lets Derek William to accompany Jamie Moore.
	"Go back to look at her. Make sure that she comes back to the manor safely. If she wants to hang out, you could just follow her." Dan William sits into the car after saying this. And then he leaves the Garden.
	It’s true that Jamie Moore refuses to marry him. But he still cares about her.
	He knows that Jamie Moore is a little disappointed. This proves that she has him in her heart, but it seems that she doesn’t realize this.
	Dan William smiles bitterly. There is a sense of helplessness in his eyes. She is so careless. Is it good or not?
	It seems that she is very smart, and she never lets other people take advantage of her. But she is so stupid that she can’t see the love from him.
	She is such an idiot.
	However, at the moment, Jamie Moore looks at the woman who stands in front of her. She presses her lips and then says in a confused way, “Why are you here?"
	
Chapter 168 Make the Wrong Friends
	July Summer walks o Jamie Moore in a black tight dress, and then she stands in front of Jamie Moore. She wears a pair of sunglasses on her face, which covers most of her face. The curled hair is spread on her chest with fragrance.
	It’s the fragrance that Jamie Moore knows the woman in front of her is July Summer.
	"Can't I be here?" July Summer pats her hair. She makes a circle of her hair with her fingers, and then she says.
	"It’s up to you." Jamie Moore looks at her lightly, and then she decides to leave.
	"It's very similar." July Summer murmurs, and then she lets go of her hair. She looks at the back of Jamie Moore, and says, “Wait.”
	Jamie Moore stops and then she looks at July Summer, “What’s the matter?”
	July Summer smiles, and then she takes a stack of photos out of her wallet. She walks to Jamie Moore, and then hands it to Jamie Moore, “You could look at this."
	Jamie Moore looks at the photos doubtfully, and her curiosity drives her to hold the picture. Then she looks at them one by one. The more she looks at them, the more frightened she is. She blinks her eyes.
	These are the photos of her and Ryan Jack at the press conference, and there are the photos of her being taken away by Dan William. She even sees that she hugs the neck of Dan William from the photo!
	If these photos are published, Jamie Moore doesn’t know what will happen.
	But she knows that there are the words of playing with two men. They will say that she is a skittish woman.
	And she doesn't know that she had been photographed!
	This shows that someone has been staring at her. Judging from the trace on the photo, this person is obviously aiming at her!
	However, she has always kept a low profile and never provoked anyone after returning home. Journalists and media should not stare at her, and they should aims at Dan William and Dan William who have greater news value.
	Is someone asked a reporter to take pictures of her intentionally?
	"Why do you have these photos? Why are you helping me?" Jamie Moore looks at her vigilantly. It’s also very strange that July summer appears at here. It seems that she came here for her specially. There is no coincidence.
	"I see this from a reporter's camera. Besides, is there any rule that stars can't come here for dinner? Now that I see you, I'll be in a good mood." July Summer says in a fine way.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and she doesn’t know whether she should believe her.
	"Honey~ ~" A handsome man comes from the garden. When he sees July Summer, he kisses her on both sides of the cheek, "Where did you go just now? Everyone is waiting for you."
	The handsome man says in French. It’s obviously that he comes here to find July Summer especially.
	Jamie Moore understands French, because her father is a French man. Although she has only saw her father for one time, it’s Chris Lockwood who teaches her French.
	July Summer answers him in French with a smile. She says in a fluently way, and it looks that she is a truly French man, “Sorry, I have something to do just now. I'll go back now."
	Jamie Moore is slightly surprised, and then she looks at July Summer in a surprised way. She knows that July Summer had just come back from America and she has been in America for several years, but she doesn't expect that she could speak French so fluently.
	It seems that July Summer happens to see her.
	July Summer leaves before she has time to think more about this. After waving to Jamie Moore, July Summer leaves with that handsome man.
	"Joe, thanks you just now, or she will know all the thing." July Summer lets go of Joe's arm and shrugs helplessly.
	It’s not easy to cheat Jamie Moore. If she doesn’t call Joe here, otherwise, Jamie Moore will know everything.
	"It's my pleasure to work for a beautiful woman." The handsome man raises July Summer's right hand, and then kisses her gently on the back of her hand. It’s like a gentleman.
	"Come on, and now we are here. I'll treat you to dinner." July Summer smiles and then walks forward.
	It’s almost noon when Jamie Moore walks out of the main gate of the Garden. Her clothes are changed by Dan William, and it’s new. Besides, she comes to the press conference last night and she doesn’t bring any cash with her. There is only a mobile phone on her body, thus she is anxious inevitably.
	She decides to call Wendy after thinking for a while.
	Wendy says she will come within half an hour after answering the phone. Jamie Moore hangs up, and then she walks to the dessert house in front of the main gate of the garden.
	Wendy finally comes when Jamie Moore eats all the dessert in the plate.
	Wendy doesn’t see Jamie Moore in the door of the Garden. Then she looks at the dessert house, and then she walks into the dessert house. It’s true that Jamie Moore is in the dessert house.
	It’s true that Jamie William will come to the place where there is food.
	"You told me that you don’t have money for a ride. Why do you eat food here?” Wendy sits in front of her. She takes a day off to pick her, but she eats so well here!
	Do you have any sense that you don't have any money?
	"If I don't come, will you be detained here to wash dishes?" Wendy is a little confused. She stabs the woman who is eating a cream mousse in front of her.
	Jamie Moor licks the cream on her lips, and then she takes a sip of coconut milk happily. She narrows her eyes, “It's OK, and I know you will come, and I believe you."
	Wendy presses her lips, and then she shakes her head, “Never believe me, you should believe me! I am cheated by your poor appearance, thus I come here!"
	Her full-time bonus is in vain!
	"Wendy, you're the best!" Jamie Moore finishes the eating, and then she takes a piece of paper to wipe his hands. "I wish you could get the love from Duke Field in return."
	"Stay away with me quickly. What’s the meaning of get the love from Duke Field?" Wendy presses her lips as she says involuntarily.
	Jamie Moore murmurs. It’s true that the strength of love is very great, which could make her eat so well.
	"Let’s go now. What are you doing here? Are you waited to wash dishes for others?" Wendy waves, and then she walks out with Jamie Moore.
	"Wait a moment, Wendy!" Jamie Moore asks affectionately.
	Wendy hugs her arms tightly, and she is shivering, “Please say now!”
	"Please pay the money before you leave..."
	“…” Wendy almost wants to smash her purse on her head, and then she goes to the counter to pay for money.
	She makes the wrong friends. It’s her fault!
	Jamie Moore is such a woman who can only eat food, but she will never pay for money.
	Wendy fastens her seat belt when she sits into the car. She looks at Jamie Moore who sits beside her. She still holds a bag of desserts that had just been brought back from the dessert room. Seeing this, Wendy presses her lips.
	She knows Jamie Moore from the high school, who loves eating, but she can’t understand this.
	
Chapter 169 Foodie
	She never becomes fact even though she eats very much. It seems that her stomach is like a bottomless hole. She will never feel that she is full!? How can she pretend to be dissatisfied!
	"Jamie Moore...You should be glad that your son's father is Dan William..." Wendy starts the car, and then leaves the Garden.
	"Why?" Jamie Moore looks at Wendy and then asks.
	"The reason is that he has enough money to feed you. If you are in other family, everyone will burn you to death." This is the most pertinent comment of Wendy toward on her.
	Wendy still remembers that the reason she knows Jamie Moore is for eating. Because she is a foodie, she likes eating.
	It’s in a big stomach competition held by the school that she knows Jamie Moore. The prize is five food coupons. You can eat, drink and have fun in the biggest food city of the city for free. The time is one day.
	Of course, only the champion is qualified to this.
	The competition is to eat chicken wings and legs.
	As soon as the chicken wings and legs appear, all people look at the chicken no one could the charm of the chicken?
	A lot of people participates this competition for eating chicken. Finally, the school sets a rule. All people who participate the competition should eat 50 pairs of chicken wings, otherwise, they should be punished.
	Many people give up for this. After all, they don't have a big stomach. It seems that 50 pairs of chicken wings are very few. But all chicken are very big. For those rich young masters, it's good for them to eat ten pairs.
	Jamie Moore is attracted by chicken. And before this, she just eats ice in the door of school. But she smells the fragrance of chicken for the distance, thus she participates the competition.
	In the end, there is 16 people participate the competition. Then one of them feels pain in her stomach, thus she gave up. Finally, there are only 15 people leaves.
	Jamie Moore and Wendy is one of them. Of course, Bruce Hill is also one of them.
	The scene is simply magnificent and indescribable when the competition starts. You can see that those people keep taking wings from the plate and putting them in their mouths. Before they swallow them, they go on to the next one, which is quite intense.
	Many people just eat the meat outside the wings, but they can’t eat the meat in the middle part of the bone.
	Jamie Moore is very calm. She catches the chicken and then she breaks them into two gently. Then she eats the chicken with in a bite, and then she continues to eat another one.
	In fact, Jamie Moore doesn’t go there for the five food coupons, but for the free wings. She thinks happily in her heart. As long as she could eat 50 pair of chicken within the prescribed time, she would not be punished.
	It’s very easy for her to eat 50 pair chicken wings.
	When the plate on the table is empty, someone will add chicken for them.
	This time, the chicken on the table unlike the original fried chicken wings in front of them. It’s abnormal spicy wings of chicken. We can see the red pepper oil on it obviously.
	Two people give up because they can’t bear it, and people on the stage are fewer than before.
	Jamie Moore likes eating spicy food. She always eats spicy chicken wings. So she doesn’t have so much feeling at first.
	Gradually, they finish the spicy chicken on the plate. Only Jamie Moore, Wendy and Bruce Hill leave on the stage.
	Jamie Moore wants to give up, but then she finds there are a few people left on the stage. As long as she keeps for several minutes, she will get five food coupons. It’s free for all day.
	Thinking of here, Jamie Moore eats quickly than before. Although her little mouth is hot red, she never wants to give up her food.
	Bruce Hill really can't stand it anymore. It's stupid to eat chicken wings to win food coupons for a girl!
	When he walks down, he even thinks that he will break up with that woman. How could she make him so embarrassed?
	Wendy is also very full. But the cheers are getting louder and louder since it’s at the end of the competition. She can’t lose the competition even for the sake of face.
	Finally, Jamie Moore bites her tongue because of eating too fast, and she loses the competition. And Wendy gets the food voucher.
	Wendy is so curious about a stranger for the first time in her life.
	She thinks that she will become friend this this strange woman at that time...
	Thinking of here, Wendy turns around and looks at Jamie Moore who holds the bags in her arms tightly. How could she know such a strange woman? How could she even be friend with her?
	"The reason you say in such way is that you don't know me well..." Jamie Moore turns her head and looks out of the window. There is a faint sadness all over her.
	Wendy is shocked, and then she holds the on the steering wheel tightly. "Jamie, you..."
	Jamie Moore suddenly turns her head again, and then she looks at her carefully, and says slowly, "Because you know me too well, thus you even want to kill..."
	Bang!
	"Ah! Why do you hit me?" Wendy hits Jamie Moore as soon as Jamie Moore finishes her words, and Jamie Moore even has no time to escape.
	"You said that people who know you well will want to kill you?" Wendy proves by her actions that she wants to kill her for a long time!
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she rubs her head. Then she falls on the chair, and it seems that she doesn’t have any bones.
	People who know her want to kill her... Jamie Moore reminds Dan William suddenly. It seems that he wants to kill her every time. Does he know her so well?
	"Where are you going now?" Jamie Moore looks out of the window, and then she finds that the road is to the business street.
	"Don’t you know the road? Today, I ask for a leave to pick you up. I'll get back to you anyway." Wendy kicks on the keyboard with her fingers and says.
	“...” Jamie Moore doesn't speak anything. She presses her lips. Going shopping with this dead woman will kill her, OK?
	Wendy parks her car in the underground parking lot of the business street. Then she walks out with Jamie Moore, and then she takes her to the business building directly.
	However, it isn't long before Wendy begins to regret take Jamie Moore to here. She wants to take advantage of Jamie, thus she takes her to here. But she forgets that Jamie Moore doesn’t have a wallet at all!
	So she pays for everything in her shopping cart!
	"I am so unlucky, but you should treat me another day. Otherwise, I'll be out of balance." Wendy walks out from a clothing store with a bag in her hand. Then she looks at Jamie Moore in a sad way.

Chapter 170 Ingrate
	"Well, you can decide the time and place." Jamie Moore smiles and then continues to shopping with Wendy.
	Wendy glances at Jamie Moore, and then she looks at the bags in her hand. It's not good to go out today.
	"It's a good shop there. It's all new and fashionable clothes for this year. Let’s have a look.” Wendy fixes her eyes on one shop and then she pulls Jamie Moore walks to that shop.
	Jamie Moore has no way but to follow Jamie Moore. Wendy is choosing clothes there, but she has no interest in it.
	"Dan William, what do you think of this one? Is that right for me?" The soft and sweet familiar voice comes from the next room, which attracts the attention of Jamie Moore.
	She sees that Jozo is holding a goose yellow dress to draw on her body. Although she is in a wheelchair, it does not affect the sweet smile on her face.
	"Well, you can buy it if you like this dress." Dan William sits on the round fabric sofa placed in the shop. He overlaps his legs, and he looks very charming.
	Jamie Moore looks at him. She finds Dan William is smiling, and now he looks very soft for the smile on his face. Now he is different from the state he had just left in the garden.
	He says that he has something to do now. It turns out that he goes shopping with a beautiful woman.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips and then she murmurs in her heart. Then she sits on the sofa beside her, and stops looking at them.
	Thing would be OK, if she doesn’t see them. Now she doesn’t want to see the face of Dan William!
	"Jamie! What do you think of this dress?" But Jamie Moore obviously forgets that Wendy says everything in a loud voice. Even if she pretends not to see them, she would still be found.
	"Can't you keep it down?" Jamie Moore glances at the shop behind her. Then she stares at Wendy and says, “It's beautiful. You can buy it and let's leave here now."
	"No, I'll try another one. Wait a moment." Wendy holds another cloth in her hand and then walks into the fitting room again.
	Hey, hey, hey!
	Jamie Moore’s hand is a little stiff. She wants to lean on the sofa, and then she hears the noise coming from her side.
	"Hey, Dan, it's Miss Moore. What a coincidence." Jozo pushes Dan William to Jamie Moore. She is surprised to see Jamie Moore.
	Dan William nods lightly. He doesn’t say anything. His eyes are very dark.
	"It’s so lucky to meet you." Jamie Moore presses her lips and she smiles officially, and then she answers in a low voice.
	"Does Miss Moore like the clothes of this shop, too? Do you come here alone?" Jozo pretends that she doesn’t see Jamie Moore's cold attitude. Then she says in a sweet way.
	"Well." Jamie Moore does not want to talk with her. She puts her hand in her pocket, and then she answers freely.
	"Well." Jozo looks at her sympathetically. It seems that it’s very sympathetic to go shopping alone. "How about shopping with us? Dan has time today, thus he come here to shopping with me.”
	She covers her mouth, and she says in a sweet way. Then she looks at Dan William bashfully.
	"No, I like a person." Jamie Moore smiles at her, and she is very polite. But she doesn’t look at Dan William.
	She scolds these two people in her heart. Why is the world so small? It's hard for her to go out for shopping. Does she could shop happily now?
	"Dan William doesn’t mind this, thus Jamie Moore doesn’t need to be constrained by this."
	Does it because of him? Jamie Moore rolls in her heart, but she still keeps calm. She looks at Jozo with a smile, “Miss Jozo, do you think you are right?”
	Jozo is shocked as soon as she hears the words of Jamie Moore. Then she lowers her head, and says, “Dan, I really don't mean that. Jamie Moore misunderstands me..."
	Ah. Shouldn't she explain this to her? Why does she explain this to Dan William?
	"It's OK. She is always such a woman. You don’t need to force her to stay with us.” Dan William comforts Jozo with the warm voice. But when she looks at Jamie Moore, his eyes are very cold.
	Jozo is very happy in her heart, but when she looks at Jamie Moore, she is in a daze. “Miss Moore, if you don’t like this, I will never force you to do this. Don't be angry."
	Jamie Moore becomes happy suddenly. Strange things happened suddenly, but it seems that there are so many strange things this year. She doesn’t say anything, but she says that she is angry. If she doesn’t do something, will she think she is not right?
	"Jamie, who are you talking with? I have chosen the clothes well. "Wendy comes out of the fitting room, and then she hands the clothes to the clerk. She is about to find Jamie Moore, and then she finds Dan William and Jozo stands in the front of Jamie Moore.
	When she sees Jozo is in a pitiful way and the Dan William out of the way, she knows there is something wrong.
	Do they want to bully Jamie Moore?
	Wendy gets angry suddenly. She walks to them quickly, and then she stares at Jozo, “Hello, sister, who are you? Do you want to bully Jamie?”
	Jozo is shocked. Is this Jamie Moore's friend? But she says that she comes here alone.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips when she sees Wendy. Then she looks at Wendy is a pitifully way, “Wendy, nothing has happened. How could Miss Jozo bully me? You misunderstand this...”
	Jozo and Dan William is all shocked by this. They don’t know why Jamie Moore shows herself in such a way.
	Is Jamie Moore a kind of person who shows weakness to others?
	It’s impossible obviously!
	What's more, Jamie Moore says that word in the same tone that Jozo uses. She is treating people in their own way!
	Wendy is shock. She doesn’t know the extra meaning of Jamie Moore’s action. Then she sees the eyesight that Jamie Moore gives to her. Since she has made friend with Jamie Moore in so many years, thus she understands the meaning of Jamie Moore suddenly.
	Jamie Moore is acting! She and Jamie Moore are good at this!
	"Is this true? Jamie, you are so pitifully. How could you be bullied by a sister?” Wendy takes Jamie Moore in her arms suddenly. She rubs her hair and says in a sad way.
	It’s the second time that Wendy calls her sister. Jozo’s face is a little stiff. She holds her hand tightly, and she is very angry now.
	"I am always a kind woman. Since I can't fight and scold the villain I meet, I can only swallow my anger." Jamie Moore covers her face. It seems that she is very sad, and she says in a murmur way.
	But in fact, she has a smile on her face.
	How could she act with her? She will kill you in a minutes, thus you can’t say anything!
	Since Jozo likes flip right and wrong and pretend to be pitiful, now she will let her know who is winner.
	"Jamie Moore, you are great. I'll take you to eat delicious food now. Let’s ignore them. Some people like staying with the wicked. Who is to blame?" Wendy pulls Jamie Moore. Then she looks at Dan William in a contempt way.
Chapter 171 You like Dan William!
	Originally, she wants to say that Dan William acts in collusion with each other. But Dan William looks at her in a sharp way. If she says in that way, she is not able to leave there.
	What’s more, he even helps others to bully Jamie Moore. Even though Wendy is blind, she knows that Jozo is not a good woman. What's the matter with Dan William? How could he let Jamie Moore be sad for such a woman!
	Wendy feels unworthy for Jamie Moore. Even if he is the brother of Duke Field, he could not bully Jamie Moore like this!
	When Wendy and Jamie Moore leave, Jozo leans on the wheelchair. She looks at Dan William in a say way, “Dan William, I know Miss Moore doesn’t love me, but how could they treat her in such a way...”
	Dan William doesn’t hear the words of Jozo. All in her mind is the sadness expression of Jamie Moore.
	In fact, he is angry about the word she says today. Thus he treats her so bad.
	He wants to tell her that she is not the right man for him, thus he treats her so sad. If she doesn’t want to marry her, he can marry with other woman. But when he sees the sadness face of Jamie Moore, he feels pain in his heart.
	To punish her is to punish him.
	In the end, he will suffer pain by himself.
	He signs, and he is helpless. He is destined to be stayed with this little woman.
	"Dan, Dan?" Jozo says for a while, but she doesn’t hear the answer from Dan William. Thus she looks up, and then she finds Dan William is in a trance!
	Jozo looks at him in a surprised way. It’s the first time that she sees him in such a way. She feels uncomfortable suddenly. Maybe this is because that she doesn’t know why he is in a trance. And he even forgets she is still here.
	Is he in a trance for someone?
	"I'll take you to have lunch." Dan William withdraws his mind and says lightly.
	"Well." Jozo nods gently, and she feels more uncomfortable than before.
	She doesn't say that she wants to have lunch. What happened to Dan William?
	Jamie Moore and Wendy come to the restaurant on the third floor of the commercial building. They sit beside the window, and then they order the meal. They laugh loudly when the waiter leaves. It looks that they are two madwomen.
	"Haha, do you see her expression just now? She is speechless like eating a rake." Wendy puts the water cup in her hand on the table forcefully. She couldn't help laughing when she reminds the expression of Jozo.
	So she hates the women who are different from each other in this life. Isn't she tire to live in such a way?
	“She has a strong background, and we are just two unimportant people. How could we compare with other people?” Jamie Moore looks at the menu in front of her, and then she says.
	God knows why she cares so much about the attitude of Dan William?
	Maybe she doesn’t like Jozo.
	Wendy, however, figures the meaning in this sentence. She moves the glass in front of her. And she stares at Jamie Moore as if she wants to find something from her expression.
	"Am I beautiful again? Why do you stop me like this?" Jamie Moore touches her face. Seeing that Wendy stares at her, she says.
	She seldom uses cosmetics. Even if she has been shopping for a long time and she is hot now, she will not in a mess.
	And now, cosmetics are waterproof.
	Is she handsome than before?
	"Narcissism." Wendy glances at Jamie, and then she sits up straight. She looks at her seriously, “Jamie Moore, according to my experience, you are ill!"
	"Ill? I'm not ill." Jamie Moore stares at her. Does that mean she should take medicine in disguise?
	"The name of this disease is--you like Dan William!" Wendy says. Hearing this, Jamie Moore almost kills her with a gush of old blood.
	Does she like Dan William?
	Is that possible?
	Jamie Moore says suddenly, "Are you kicked by an ass?"
	She even shakes her head as she says. She proves firmly that she doesn’t like Dan William.
	Although the Moore Family treats Jamie Moore badly, Dan William gives all warm that Jamie Moore lacks.
	She is willful and arrogant. If she doesn't see chestnut cake when she wakes up, she will cry sadly. Thus Dan William will in a bad mood all day.
	When she leaves suddenly, Dan William doesn’t adapt it for a long time.
	"Really? But I think you are jealous just now." As soon as the waiter put the thing on the table, Wendy takes the straw out and puts it aside. She takes the cup and drinks it directly.
	"Does your brain lock by the glue? What are you thinking about all day long? If I like him, he must be my man in minutes. Do I still need to stay alone until now?" Jamie Moore glances at the plate and eats the dishes she likes.

Chapter 172 Who do You Want to Marry?
	"Miss Jamie, I have to remind you that you already have a child, and the father of the child is still alive, and you are recognized as lovers. If you are single, why should I be so infatuated with others?" Wendy shakes her head.
	Anyway, it's possible that Jamie Moore and Dan William will get married, but she can't even let Duke Field know that she loves him. Don't mention how sad she is.
	Secret love is a stage play of her. Because she doesn’t have a protagonist, no one would applaud and cheer even if she performs so well.
	Maybe Wendy is too publicity. When Wendy likes someone, she's very shy and she dares not to show her love.
	Jamie Moore is different from Wendy. Jamie Moore even doesn’t know her mind. If she knows that she loves Dan William, she will find Dan William with Ian Moore. She will not wait here.
	People are all like this. In fact, the inner is always far less brave and decisive than the appearance.
	Especially in front of the person you love. No matter how brave it is, it's just a bubble. It will be broken when you touch it lightly. "So what? Maybe one day I'll take Ian Moore to live with another man. Who loves her?" Jamie More snorts. She keeps eating as if she afraid that others would not know that she was a foodie.
	Wendy swallows the spittle, and then she holds the chopsticks tightly.
	"Jamie Moore, stopping talking now..."
	"Do you also think I am right? Ian Moore told me that he will take me to elope with him when he is upset one day. Then he will never find me. He is not only a man in the world. Can’t I marry with another man?" Jamie Moore pokes at the white rice in the bowl heavily, and then she snorts.
	The expression of Wendy becomes stiff, and her hand is shivering and then she says, “Jamie Moore, I can’t save you if you continue to say in such a way.
	Jamie Moore looks at her in a puzzled way. She wants to say something. Then she hears a cold voice. The voice is full of anger, thus she shivers uncontrollably.
	Jamie Moore is surprised. The man holds her chin suddenly, and then she sees the cold and deep eyes of Dan William. He stares at her with anger. But there is smile on her face. If one could not feel the anger around her, he looks like an elegant young man.
	"What did you say right now?" Dan William asks casually. He asks with a smile, “Who do you want to marry? Well?"
	How could he be here!
	Jamie Moore feels that she has lost all her strength. She almost loose the chopstick and throws it onto the table.
	She still underestimates the endurance of her in front of Dan William.
	There is no one who could bear all of his momentum. Jamie Moore is a little surprised when she sees Dan William is in such a way.
	"No, no, you're wrong. You hear it wrong." Jamie Moore chooses to pretend to be stupid. She believes that as long as he pretends to be stupid in the end, she will not be killed in such a bad way.
	"Oh? Are you sure?" he says in a low way. Jamie Moore could hear the threaten meaning in the words of Dan William.
	She shouldn't speak something bad of him behind him! How could he do this before? Now he is in his hand, and she must be killed for this...
	Jamie Moore wrinkles her face. If she knows that she will meet her here, she will say something good of him loudly!
	"I’m sure! Mr. Dan is so popular. Anyone will love you, as long as they see you. Even though I need to marry somebody, I will want to marry you first.” Jamie Moore receives the reminding eyesight of Wendy, and then she says in such a way.
	Dan William narrows his eyes. He holds her chin with his fingers, and then he says, “Consider?"
	"No, no, no, I don’t need to consider this. You are such a good man. If I meet you, I will marry you immediately. I don’t need to consider this. I don’t need to consider this!” Jamie Moore says firmly, but she cries in her heart.
	Although he knows that the woman in front of him is cheating him, but he feels happy when he hears her words.
	It could be seen as keep a little hope for him.
	He relaxed a little, and the smile on the corner of his lips does not change. He puts down his fingers, and then sits beside Jamie Moore.
	The body of Jamie Moore suddenly becomes stiff. She sits there still as if she can’t move.
	Jozo, who sits behind Dan William, feels uncomfortable. She walks to Wendy in the wheelchair. Then somebody immediately pulls the chair for her, thus she could sits there easily.
	"Miss Moore, do you mind if we sit there?" Jozo looks at Jamie Moore and asks.
	She uses “we” to untie herself and Dan William together, and Jamie Moore in not include in her words.
	"Will you leave if I mind this?" Wendy looks at her with a smile and then says.
	Jozo doesn’t expect that Wendy would not show any respect to her. What’s more, Dan William is still here. She thinks that they will not refuse her even though they mind it. Thus they could only bear it.
	But now...It seems that she should bear this.
	"You are so funny. Since Dan William is here, so I should also be here.”
	She is such a calculating woman. Even Jamie Moore wants to applaud for her.
	But Jamie Moore is very depressed. Why does she need to deal the woman around Dan William?
	Dan William is very calm, and he doesn’t show any expression for the words of Jamie Moore.
	"Young master." Derek William appears suddenly. He wears black dress and black sunglasses. The atmosphere around him is very cold.
	Dan William nods.
	"The thing you want to know has a result now.”
	"Well." Dan William ponders for a few seconds. He turns to look at Jamie Moore softly, and then he says, “Wait for me here."
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore blinks. She doesn’t know his meaning, thus she asks.
	But Dan William has stood up. Derek William follows him, and then they walks to the outside together.
	What!
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she takes a sip of juice in front of her.
	"Miss Moore and Dan have a good relationship, which is enviable." Jozo smiles. She lowers down her head to hide the true feeling in her eyes.
	It’s her who comes out with Dan William. But Dan only cares about Jamie Moore.
Chapter 173 I Never Joke
	As long as Jamie Moore is here, Dan William will never see her.
	Jozo closes her eyes sadly. She has lost two legs for saving him. But why doesn't he want to marry her?
	"No one could involve into them easily.” Wendy says meaningfully.
	Jozo answers calmly. She smiles softly, “Dan William has told me that if he will marry somebody, he will consider me first.” she says shyly, and then she lowers her head.
	Wendy and Jamie Moore looks into each other. One is very angry, and one is in a daze.
	"What did you mean?" Jamie Moore looks at Jozo and says doubtfully. She doesn’t know the meaning of Jozo’s word. Dan William will marry her if he wants to get married. Does this have any relationship with her?
	"It means that Dan will marry me." Jozo looks at her shamefully, and then she covers her mouth and smiles.
	It seems that Dan William has married with her.
	"Oh." Jamie Moore nods, and she feels a little uncomfortable.
	Will Dan William marry Jozo? He tells her that she will marry her. Is he joking with her?
	Wendy is in a hurry when she sees this. Jozo is not a kind man. She tells this to Jamie Moore. Does she want to break the relationship between Jamie Moore and Dan William?
	Jamie Moore is such a fool. How can she believe it?
	"You wait for me in the car." Dan William has returned to the restaurant. He stares at Jozo, but he says to Jamie Moore.
	"Dan?" Jozo is a little shocked. She thinks Dan William says to her.
	"I will leave with Wendy first." Jamie Moore shrinks her shoulders. She feels uncomfortable for the words of Jozo. She needs to stay away from Dan William!
	"Come back." Dan William looks at Jamie Moore, and then he hands the key of the car to her.
	Does she ask her to wait in the car? Jamie Moore holds the key. She always acts slowly. Finally, Wendy can’t bear it. She pulls Jamie Moore’s arm, and takes her to the outside.
	If Jamie Moore could become smart one day, she will cry for happy!
	When Jamie Moore and Wendy leave, Dan William sits down slowly. He overlaps his leg, and he looks at Jozo with dark eyesight.
	Seeing that Dan William asks Jamie Moore to leave here, Jozo is very happy. She looks at Dan William with a smile, and says in a sweet way, “Dan, what do you want to talk with me?"
	"You told Jamie Moore that I will marry you?" He picks up the coffee cup on the table, and then he drinks it. He is in a lazy way. Everyone is attracted by his handsome face.
	His voice is very clear, and it’s flowing like water. There is nothing wrong with it.
	Jozo thinks Dan William has understood her mind, and he will accept her!
	"Am I right? You still owe me a wish." Jozo explains softly, which affirms the question of Dan William.
	Dan William doesn’t look at her. He stirs the coffee with the white porcelain spoon in his fingers. He presses his lips as he hears her word. “Do you remember what I said to you when you just come to country C?"
	"What?" Jozo is stunned, and then she reminds the word that Dan William has told her. She remembers very word Dan William told her. But she doesn’t the exact word he says.
	"I told you that I love someone." Dan William says calmly. It seems that he is just chatting with her.
	Jozo is shocked. He has told this to her. But she thinks that he just refuses her with this excuse!
	"I think that you are just joking with me." Jozo lowers her head. She holds the skirt tightly. At this moment, she wants to escape from here.
	She is a smart woman. How can’t she know the purpose of the word of Dan William?
	Do you do this for that woman--Jamie Moore!
	"I’m never joking with you." Dan William looks at her and his eyesight is very cold.
	"Is the woman you loved Jamie Moore?" Jozo says in a grievances and sad way. She pretends to be strong, and she looks at Dan William.
	"Yes." Dan William nods his head affirmatively, but what he says next shocks Jozo more even more.
	"I will only marry with Jamie Moore. So you don't have to waste your time on me. I don’t want to hear the word you said to Jamie Moore again.” Dan William scrapes the coffee cup with his fingers gently. He says in a clear and incomparable way.
	In fact, Dan William knows that Jamie Moore doesn’t have any action, though she hears the words of Jozo.
	The reason is that she doesn’t like him.
	The eyesight and behavior of her show the truth to Dan William clearly.
	There is no one in the world who knows Jamie Moore better than Dan William.
	She knows that her EQ is low, and she is always slower than others in love. But he never forces her before. He believes that as long as he treats her well, she will know his love even though she is stupid.
	But Dan William is wrong.
	He is wrong.
	Jamie Moore is an emotional idiot. She is even more idiotic than he imagines. It's more difficult to expect her to wake up.
	So when Jamie Moore asks Jozo without any expression after she hears the word of Jozo, he has known all of this.
	This is doomed to be a deep love of his own, and he can’t say it out clearly.
	But even though Jamie Moore doesn’t mind it, Dan William minds this. Even though he knows that Jamie Moore will have no action when she hears the words of Jozo, Dan William still doesn’t want to let other woman to be his wife.
	This position only belongs to Jamie Moore, and it will not be changed forever.
	Dan William just wants to give a warning to Jamie Moore. He would not let go of anyone who bullies Jamie Moore.
	It's just a matter of importance.
	"You love her, and you want to marry her. What should I do?” Jamie Moore says with cry. She looks at Dan William pitifully.
	"I have lost my legs. What do you want me to do in my life? Who can accept me like this? Dan, how can you be so cruel?" Tears falls from the corner of Jozo’s eye, and then drips on the back of her hand. It seems that she can’t control herself, and she cries sadly.
	She had fantasized about the scene of entering the wedding hall with Dan William countless times, and she also fantasized about the way he proposed to her on one knee, but she never thinks that he would refuse her in such a direct way.
	Besides, she has lost her legs. Even though she wants to recover her legs, she still needs to wait for a long time. What should she do without him?
	Dan William frowns. He looks at Jozo in a sad way. And then he signs, and says, “Jozo, I owe you a life, but there are many ways to repay it. I can't gamble my whole with the woman I loved.”
Chapter 174 He just Wants Jamie
	"I'll give you everything you want except me. If you want my life, then I can also give you. Or let’s have a bet. I will let you choose the way. If I die, we will be quits. If not, then what I owe you will be paid. "
	What he says is as sharp as a sword, making people barely doubt his words.
	This is the longest speeches Dan says to Jozo while it happens in this way.
	Jozo looks up at Dan in shock with tears in her eyes. She is crying as if she is so poor and lovable, "You ..."
	This is something she can’t think of.
	Perhaps she has never understood this man clearly. She thinks she can hold him with paralyzed legs and marry him successfully. Even if he doesn’t want to marry her, he will agree because of his responsibility.
	Before now, Jozo has been very confident. So her attitude towards Alma will only be worse day by day.
	Because Alma is the person Dan sends to her. She subconsciously regards Alma as her servant and may still pretend in front of her at first. But after a long time, she begins to claim herself in the name of Mrs. William. Moreover, with the fact that Alma never utters to resist, her attitude becomes more and more bad.
	Because Jozo is really confident that she can marry Dan.
	But now? He wants to return his life to her and is not willing to marry her!
	Doesn’t Jozo really appreciated by him? Is she really not as good as Jamie who is good for nothing?
	What makes she think that she can compare with the pair of legs that Jozo pays to save Dan?
	Jozo is jealous and resentful, and she is very unwilling. Her lowers her eyes, seeming to have countless anger erupting out but still have to hold it back.
	After about two minutes, Jozo says in a low voice, "Dan, you can go back. I want to be alone."
	Dan's eyes flickers and glances at watch, thinking that Jamie is waiting for him in the parking lot downstairs. So he states, "Then I will go back first and I will let Alma pick you up."
	Jozo doesn't answer again. Dan purses his lips and stands up to walk out.
	In fact, Dan can satisfy Jozo with everything she wants. Even if she wants to be a princess, he can fulfill her wish immediately.
	However, he really can't fulfill her wish.
	Maybe he is cold, ruthless and indifferent. His love has already been given to Jamie, and he can't give it to another person.
	His love can be seen as the extreme love. But for people like him, they may be fine if they don’t love anyone. But once they fall in love, they really can’t let go of the lover.
	What’s more, there is also Ian. Dan wants to add “Dear” in front of their baby. But no one knows better than him that he and Jamie can’t be called lovers. They are tightly tied together.
	In his life, she is never allowed to escape away from him.
	Jozo tells Dan to leave while in fact, she wants Dan to stay with her. But she doesn’t expect that he really leaves.
	Jozo suddenly looks up. Her eyes look not as gentle as before but show countless resentments and jealousy. She bites her lower lip tightly and squeezes out two words from her red lips, "Jamie, Moore!”
	No matter anyone who stops her, she will fight with her until death!
	Jamie doesn’t know that during the short time that Dan and Jozo are communicating, something suddenly is diverging from the formal path. She is sitting in Dan’s car, waiting for him in the car as he wishes.
	She secretly scolds that she is so futile. She just obeys whatever he orders? Jamie, where are your dignity?
	Well, Dan is more terrible than her dignity...
	What is he talking to Jozo? Jamie lies on the window, frowning her eyebrows to imagine the conversation. Why doesn’t he come downstairs now? Doesn’t he just forget about her for being courting?
	Just when Jamie is thinking about whether to drive the car and leave first, she sees that the slender and handsome figure coming out of the commercial building and walking towards here.
	A mischief emerges from Jamie's mind. She raises her lips and smiles slyly.
	Dare he let her wait for him? Although I can’t win you, I can run away from you.
	Thinking about this, Jamie moves from the front seat to the driver's seat and fastens the seat belt. She inserts the car key and starts the engine. Then the car rushes out.
	When Dan approaches the parking lot, he sees his car oncoming. It makes him startled for a few seconds.
	In just a few seconds, Jamie opens the window and throws a bill to him. She says arrogantly, "This is your taxi fare and you can go back by yourself. I’m willing to accompany you!"
	The window is closed as soon as the words are finished. Then the speed of the car is increased to two hundred miles and she leaves Dan behind.
	At this time, Jamie is laughing in the car with her head facing upward. Poor guy. So why do you teach me how to drive? Now I just use your skills to pay you back!
	"Jamie!" Dan looks at his car driven away by Jamie. He can’t see her shadow at all. And he can think about why she does like this.
	He picks up the bill that Jamie has just thrown in front of him. It is a bill of a hundred dollar. Taxi fare?
	He raises the corners of his lips and tightens his fingers holding the banknotes. She is so wonderful. This lady is so gutty that she dares to be rebellious!
	Jamie drives Dan's car to the manor very confidently and the speed is gradually decreased. She is very confident that Dan has to take a taxi to return to the manor without a car. Of course, when he comes back, she will hide in Ian’s room. He can’t have any idea.
	Jamie, who immerses in her great imagination, drives the car into the manor and parks in the parking lot next to the villa. She is proud and does not discover a royal blue Lamborghini parked in front of her.
	She opens the door and is about to go out.
	Suddenly she is grabbed by a hand and she is pulled out vigorously. That force is so hard that she almost does not stabilize her body.
	Before she can react, her body is lifted up by someone. Her nose can feels a mint smell. She is suddenly lifted up. So her head faces downward, which makes her dizzy.
	"Rob!" Jamie tries to stabilize her body. She raised her head and sees Dan who walks inside by holding her with ease. She just shouted loudly.
	Why is he quicker than her? It won't be so fast even if he flies?
	"Why are you here? You shouldn't ..."
	Dan just groans. Because her weight is very light, it seems to him as easy as carrying a ball of cotton. Hearing her words, he reaches out and pats hard on her little ass, "Do you regard Derek as a useless person?”
	
Chapter 175 Being Put under House Arrest
	Derek?
	Derek! !
	Jamie suddenly understands after she is stunned. How does she forget Derek?
	Derek will be with Dan whenever and wherever he is. Although you can't him, he is indeed there. And Derek's efficiency and quickness can't be described by any words.
	Just for a car. How can she be so naive and really think that Dan has no methods?
	She really does misjudge it!
	"Daddy, are you bullying mommy, right?" Ian hears the sound and runs downstairs. Seeing that Dan is hitting Jamie's ass, he widens eyes and asks.
	"No, how will I do that? Daddy is developing affection with your mummy." Dan answers Ian with a soft expression gently, which makes him not look like a bad person.
	Jamie is still upset. Developing affection? Has anyone developing affection in this way? Bunny, don't believe him!
	Ian looks at Dan in disbelief, staring at his face carefully and trying to figure out something, "Really?"
	"Of course it is. How can Daddy cheat Bunny?" Dan carries Jamie and bends over to touch Ian's head. His eyes are gentle and peaceful. He also has a little smile on his face, which really makes him look more gentle.
	Ian shows a big smile and gets out of the way for Dan, "Then I believe in Daddy. Mommy, may you have a good relationship with Daddy!"
	That’s ridiculous.
	Jamie looks at Ian mournfully, "Baby, save ..."
	"Believe it or not, I will throw you down now if you say another word." Dan's low warning sound comes to her ear with a strong threat.
	Jamie closes her mouth immediately while her sights keep still looking at Ian mournfully until the door closed. She can only cry without tears.
	Dan throws Jamie on the bed and looks at her condescendingly with a frivolous meaning in his eyes. "You just stay here to reflect on yourself. What do you do wrong? Don't even think about dinner until you figure out."
	After saying, he leaves the bedroom and closes the door.
	The next moment comes a wailing from the master bedroom.
	"Dan, you're not a human! Why do you keep me here? Come back!" Jamie rushes to the door after she regains her mind and he strides to the door to twists the lock for a few times. But she finds that it is locked!
	This is house arrest definitely! It is illegal!
	In the evening, Ian sits in his seats on the dining table and looks at Dan who is enjoying food elegantly. Ian asks doubtfully, "Daddy, why doesn’t Mummy come down to have dinner?"
	"Your mommy plans to lose weight recently and she doesn’t eat anything." Dan slowly answers him. He is the typical one that don’t blush when they are lying.
	"Well." Ian nods. He knows that girls are fond of being beautiful. He often sees some girls in school have many meals but little food at each to keep their slim body. Is she because of this?
	"Bunny, Daddy has something to ask you." Dan put down the knife and fork in his hand and looks at Ian. His eyes flickers and hints Cindy and the servants to leave here.
	Cindy nods and leads the servant out of the restaurant.
	Ian sees that Dan has taken away the outsiders so he thinks that there must be something important. Therefore, he nods obediently and moves closer to him.
	"Did you arrange the explosion of the Moore’s family?" Dan narrows his eyes and looks at Ian, who is very close to him. Then he and his heart become soften into a piece.
	Before that, when Ian and Night.1 first comes to the manor, Night.1 reminds him that Ian is not an ordinary child. But getting along with him day by day, Dan feels that Ian is indeed smarter and more intelligent than ordinary children. He is also clever and keen. He is proud at first.
	But when the explosion of the Moore’s happens, he never doubts Ian. Because even if he is smart, he is just a child after all.
	But Dan neglects that since Ian knows Night.1, there must have something to do with him in this little explosion.
	Why doesn’t the Moore’s house explode? While it happens after Jamie is attacked.
	In addition, this boy extremely protects Jamie and he won’t allow anyone to disrespect Jamie.
	However, the results from Derek’s investigation shock Dan seriously. Because he only finds that Ian and Night.1 have been to the Moore’s house and are also present when the explosion occurs too. As for other issues, they don’t investigate anything even with Derek’s ability.
	There are not many people in the whole Country C who can conceal anything under Dan.
	This makes him not only doubt the true identity of Night.1.
	He remembers that Ian is nominally his younger brother last time when Night.1 comes to the manor with Ian. But his attitude towards Ian is definitely not the one towards a child or a friend.
	It looks more like treating him as his own boss.
	Therefore, Dan will connect these things one by one and figure out a result. Ian becomes the boss of Night.1 for some reason. So the explosion of the Moore’s house is done by Night.1 who is ordered by Ian.
	As for why Ian knows such a powerful character, it is unknown.
	"Daddy, do you know about it?" Ian blinks with his wide eyes, looking at Dan, worrying that Daddy will not like him because of what he does.
	Because he is working hard to be a good boy in front of them.
	Even for the identity of Night.1, Ian doesn't tell Jamie because he just doesn’t want her to worry.
	If Jamie knows, Night.1 will definitely be driven away!
	"Well?" Dan reaches out and rubs Ian's hair, showing a little surprise in his eyes. What special identity does his son have?
	"Um ... I admit that I do i. but I don’t do it in person. Because they bully mommy." Ian explains seriously. In his heart, Jamie is the most important one. He is a little man so he must protect her mommy well.
	"Oh? If someone does something bad to Daddy one day, will you do the same thing?" Dan asks jealously.
	Dan isn't jealous that Ian puts Jamie in the first place. What is he jealously is how important is he in his heart as his daddy?
	Ian looks at him with his head tilted and answers, "No."
	Dan's face quickly turns bad.
	"Daddy, who can bully you here? Bunny and mommy are still waiting for you to protect. Why do you struggle with this issue? It's too childish." He shows his index finger and shakes it left and right when he is talking. He seems to say it’s a bad idea.
	Dan really can’t help laughing when he sees this.
	Dan's heart is suddenly moved. He pinches Ian's soft face and chuckles "Bunny is right and reasonable. Henceforth, if you get into trouble, you can hide behind Daddy and no one dares to bully you."
	
Chapter 176 Be a Friend Since Then
	Ian raises his chin proudly, "Bunny is not the spineless child. Hiding behind Daddy is not a man's behavior!"
	If Ian is bullied, he should double attack it back. How can he stand and be bullied?
	That's too cowardly and is not his style!
	Although as it is... Daddy's words warm his heart. He has never experienced the thing that he can hide behind Daddy when he is in troubles.
	Ian's eyes rolls, thinking whether he can create an opportunity to experience it.
	"Hah hah, okay. You are Daddy's great baby." Dan stands up and hugs Ian's little body to make several turns.
	He hears that children like to play in this way. Dan specifically learns it from the Internet.
	Ian grins and really likes the way he got along with Dan. There is no pressure at all and he feels it very different from being with Jamie. But he likes it very much.
	Suddenly there is a loud noise from outside, bothering the beautiful atmosphere at this moment.
	Dan frowns and walks out of the villa directly while holding Ian.
	On the lawn outside the villa, a group of servants forms a circle. He doesn’t know what they are looking at. From their sights, they can only vaguely see a white corner of clothing from the crowd.
	Jamie is originally in the bedroom but there’s nobody open the door for her after waiting for a long time. Then she climbs down from the balcony angrily. Originally, her goal is the swimming pool downstairs. However, she doesn’t keep the right direction. So she accidentally falls to the lawn beside the swimming pool.
	Although she isn’t not injured, she sprains her ankle.
	Jamie is sitting on the lawn, covering her injured ankle which is already swollen. But in front of so many people, she is reluctant to say that she is really injured.
	"What's the matter?" Dan and Ian walk to Jamie and squats down to look at her.
	Jamie's eyes rolls around, glancing at the servants around. She shuts her mouth and says nothing.
	Dan's black eye manifests his anger and he raises his eyebrows. Then he says to the servants, "What are you doing here? If you are too free, you can come to Cindy to settle your salary and leave."
	The servants suddenly leave away. Soon there are only Dan, Ian and Jamie. Cindy even let a few servants guiding in a distance and letting no one pass.
	"Let me see." Dan takes her hand away from her ankle. As expected, it is already swollen.
	"Mommy! Why do you want to jump off the building in despair?" Ian looks at Jamie and asks sorrowfully. Then Ian leans close to Jamie's ankle and gently blows a few breaths. "Bunny can blow it for you so you won't feel painful."
	Jamie looks at Ian feelingly. Her baby is still thoughtful.
	"She's stupid indeed!" Dan stretches out his finger and pokes Jamie's head hard. Then he holds her up and walks to the villa.
	Ian follows them with his short legs.
	"I'm not stupid! Who let you to lock me up? Will I hurt my feet if you don't lock me up?" Jamie's ankle is so painful that her face becomes pale. But her mouth is still not forgiving. She pokes hard on his arm with her hands.
	"Mommy, you can't jump off the building even then. Bunny will worry about you." Ian pouts and decides not to help Jamie this time when he sees Jamie's swollen ankles which looks like a bun. He will stand on Dan's side this time.
	"When does mommy jump off the building? I want to jump into the swimming pool. Who knows that I will fall on the lawn because of the wrong direction?"
	She's not that silly, okay? It's too scary to joke with her life.
	"..." Dan and Ian glances at each other, and the frustration in their sights really showing a meaning.
	She’s so stupid.
	It is almost ten o'clock after applying potion on Jamie and letting the servants prepare the food again to fulfill her.
	Dan sits on the sofa in the bedroom and rubs his eyebrows. His eyes are fulfilled with a little tiredness. He leans on the sofa to hear the watering sounds in the bathroom, as if thinking about something. His whole person looks more gentle under the warm orange light of the bedroom while he is usually a cold man. The light blue home clothes he wears on his body makes him not look as keen as usual but gives him a quiet and leisure style.
	A ring of cell phone suddenly appears in the bedroom, breaking out the original silence.
	Dan glances at the cell phone that is thrown on the table. He put down the overlapping legs and stands up quickly to pick up the cell phone to answer, "Hello?"
	"Dan, it's me." Jozo's voice came softly from the phone. There’s no crying when she is in the restaurant. She seems to calm down.
	"Yes." Dan responds indifferently, stepping towards the rooftop. He leans against the railing and frowns as if he is thinking, "What's the matter?"
	Jozo takes a deep breath and says, "Dan, I think a lot after I come back. I know that feelings cannot be forced."
	After a few seconds of silence on the phone, Jozo does not receive a reply. So she continues, "I sincerely bless you and Jamie. I also figure out clearly that we can be friend in the future."
	"It’s great that you can understand it." Dan's voice is still calm and there isn't much emotion. But the tiredness between his eyes is gradually reduced.
	"Of course, if I fall in love with other men in the future, you have to remember to be my tough backstage so that he doesn't dare to bully me."
	"No problem." At this moment, Dan really feels relieved. He is actually most tired of the kind of woman who is entangled. But Jozo is kind to him. He can’t be overdoing to her for the reasonable thoughts. Now it’s better that she can understand by herself.
	"Well, that's okay. I'll hang up first. Have a good night." Jozo looks at her screen and presses hands-free button, expecting Dan to say good night to her.
	But fantasy is always too wonderful while reality is always cruel.
	"Okay." Dan answers and hangs up the phone without hesitation. He looks at the time on the screen and turns to enter the bedroom.
	He sees Jamie lying on the side of the bed and wrapping herself tightly in the quilt. She seems to have fallen asleep.
	After injuring her leg, she can still move so flexibly. Dan walks to the bed. His long fingers gently touch Jamie's sleepy face. He really underestimates her anti-beat ability.
	In Jozo's residence.
	Alma squats down silently to pick up pieces of glass on the ground, as well as pieces of precious porcelains, which have a value of at least 10 million dollar.
	Behind her, Jozo keeps throwing all the things she can reach to the floor. Accompanied by several angry roars, the debris keeps coming towards Alma's back. But she is still expressionless and calm that she lowers her head to pick up them one by one and put in the trash can.
Chapter 177 She isn’t Reconciled at all
	Suddenly, a vase comes straight towards Alma. Alma feels the movement behind her and she narrows her eyes. Then she turns her body slightly to the side and escapes the vase that is coming to her.
	Before she turns around, another vase hits her left shoulder and the fragments of the vase cut deeply into her flesh.
	It hurts, but Alma doesn't cry out in pain. She doesn't even frown but stands up straightly. She turns around and looks at Jozo, who is still crazy expressionlessly. For the first time she says to her in a rebellious tone, "Jozo, please understand your status clearly. My boss is Dan, not you. So you are not qualified to hit me."
	Alma wants to say this for a long time.
	No matter how angry or annoyed Jozo is before, she just throws things to vent her anger or insults her. It has never been like today. She even hits her directly with things and wants to kill her!
	Over the past few years, Alma has obeyed Dan’s orders and has taken care of Jozo with all her efforts. But Alma has always been a person of Dan. She has always obeyed to Dan, not Jozo.
	She just comes to take care of Jozo. Dan does not say that she is given to Jozo. Alma should still uphold this right of personal freedom.
	There is absolutely no kind person in the training camp. Alma's silence and obedience in daily life don’t mean that she is good to bully.
	"My status? Do I need you to remind me? What the hell are you? You’re just Dan's dog. How can you criticize me here? Since that Dan sends you to me, you can't say a word if I let you die now."
	Jozo's expression is full of maliciousness and her malicious eyes are fixed on Alma's expressionless face. What Jozo hates most is that she is always expressionless when facing her, as if she is laughing at her.
	Alma glances at her without saying anything and turns to walk towards the door.
	"Jozo, you’d better have a rest early." She says slowly when she reaches the door and then she leaves.
	Another vase hits the place where Alma has just stood in.
	Hearing the sounds of broken porcelain one after another, Alma walks downstairs without any emotion. She just ignores the roar behind her.
	"Come back. Who allows you to leave? Alma! Come back and clean all the debris on the ground!" Jozo keeps throwing things to the door. Her palms are cut by the debris and the blood is gurgling.
	There is only silence in the room.
	Drops of fresh blood runs down Jozo's palm, and the sound of blood dripping on the floor seems to be horrified in the quiet room.
	It takes a long time for Jozo to raise her head. Her face is covered by the scattered black hair and then the dim moonlight comes outside the window. Her eyes are as horrible as a viper. Her lower lip is bitten to blood by her. The blood of her palm is still flowing. But she seems not to feel it and she slowly bend down to pick up the phone on the ground with her injured palm.
	After a few seconds, the phone has got through, "Amelia, it's me."
	The voice is calm, as if nothing has happened from her hand just now.
	After a pause, a shock appears in Jozo's cold eyes. And she asks again to make sure, "What are you talking about? Jamie has a baby. And the baby is your Dan’s?"
	She still thinks there is a way to remedy it although Dan tells her like that today. Then what Amelia says now will undoubtedly harm her confidence again.
	"Yeah, although I don't like Jamie very much, after all, she has my brother's baby. And they will definitely get married in the future ... Hello? Jozo? Why don't you speak? Can you hear me?" The cell phone is thrown on the ground but Amelia's eager inquiries keeps coming out. Jozo don't know how hard it takes her to restrain not to vent her temper to Amelia. She buries her face between her knees, and her shoulders can’t stop shivering with sadness and anger.
	She has planned everything. Even if Dan doesn’t want to marry her, she has a way to force him to marry her. But now, everything is out of her control!
	First it is Jamie. Then it is Jamie and Dan's baby. She can’t expect such a great change!
	She isn’t reconciled at all!
	Amelia doesn't know her inadvertent words has affected Jozo. After waiting a while for Jozo's voice, she shrugs and hangs up the phone.
	Early the next morning, the swelling Jamie's ankle is almost reduced. She doesn't go to work for several days but today she gets up early. She sends Dan to school with Dan and goes to CR.
	Seeing Dan, Secretary Sam comes to greet him with a stack of documents in his hands. He asks respectfully and politely, "Mr.William, the director of Moon is waiting for you in the VIP room. Do you want to go now?"
	"Well." Dan nods and then turns to Jamie behind him, "You go and prepare two cups of coffee for me." After that, he walks into the VIP room.
	She?
	Jamie widens her mouth in amazement and looks at Secretary Sam. When does she take over the job of Secretary Sam and start to server tea for him?
	"Miss Moore, come on quickly. Mr. William doesn't like to wait." Secretary Sam reminds Jamie when he sees that Jamie is still stunned.
	"Oh, okay." Jamie touches her nose embarrassingly. Then she smiles and turns away.
	In the VIP room, two men who have very different styles are sitting opposite each other with polite smiles on their faces. They all look calm and peaceful. But the torrent is secretly surging. The two men are competing against each other.
	"I don't know why does Mr. Jack come over here today?" Dan squints at Ryan. He is dissatisfied with his behavior, not to mention that this man is still eyeing at his woman and son. Just for this point, he can let Dan overestimate him.
	Because, in those five years, it is the man in front of him who replaces him. It does make Dan care about it a little but it is not enough to call it crisis.
	"I have no advice in fact. I'm only here today to discuss with Mr. William about the product launch of Moon." Ryan smiles lightly and is polite but alienated.
	"I remember that your launch of new product is over." Dan frowns gradually, and his deep eyes looks mystery as a deep lake, which is having a faint luster.
	"Yes, the press conference is over." Ryan says slowly with a glimmer of expectation in his eyes. "But our president decides to further promote this product and makes innovations based on the previous endorsements. We want to use two-person endorsements."
	Dan looks up at Ryan and says with a smile, "So, who is another spokesperson?"
	Ryan smiles and is about to say that name while Jamie pushes the door to come in.
Chapter 178 I’m Afraid I'm Going to Disappoint You
	Jamie put down the cup in her hand and glances at Ryan secretly. And she just smiles at him.
	The grin is just caught by Dan, and his black eyes flicks a bit of displeasure. He reaches out to take the coffee cup in front of him, but finds that it is not a coffee in the cup of Ryan. It is a glass of boiled water.
	His fingers holding the coffee cup cannot help but tightening. His eyes stays on Jamie's smiling face for a few seconds and his dark eyes turn gloomy, as if a gust of wind is appearing.
	Ryan takes the glass of boiled water in front of him as if he doesn’t know anything. He smiles at Jamie gently with joy in his warm eyes. "I don't expect that you will remember I can't drink coffee. And I think you may forget."
	Saying this, he looks at Dan who has no expression and his lips slightly raise.
	"You are allergic to coffee and I am allergic to perfume. How can this be forgotten?" For Jamie, the reason why she remembers is just because she is allergic to perfume and Ryan is allergic to coffee. For her, it is only a little matter.
	So she doesn't feel anything wrong when she just says it directly in front of everyone.
	However, the speaker is unintentional while the listener can catch the meanings. Jamie's unintentional words are heard by Dan and it is very indifferent.
	She remembers a small habit of Ryan. Does she like Ryan? So she repeatedly refuses him. Such thoughts gradually form in Dan’s mind. And once it is formed, it is difficult for him to deny it if he wants.
	As he thinks, Jamie does not seem to like him.
	The reason why she will agree to live in the manor is because of Ian. If Ian is not here, he’s afraid that she isn’t willing to stay in that place for a day.
	Only in Jamie, Dan will feel frustrated. He masters the economic life of the entire Country C. Countless people relies on his life. He is decisive and resolute. He is a myth that everyone respects him.
	However, he is defeated by a woman.
	And this woman doesn't love him in her heart.
	Jamie stands for a while and finds that the atmosphere inside has suddenly cooled. She turns to look at Dan beside her. He lowers his eyes. There is no expression on his handsome face. She doesn’t know if it is an illusion or not. Jamie actually feels a sorrow from his expression.
	Sorrow?
	As soon as this idea comes out of her mind, Jamie immediately denies it. She feels that she has this idea just because she is crazy. Who the hell is Dan? Will he be sad?
	Does this man, who never cares anything in his mind,know what sadness is?
	Jamie quietly throws out her tongue and suddenly feels that this idea is too horrifying. She may not think about it.
	It only takes about a minute for Dan to manage his emotions. Then he glances at Jamie, who is still standing there. His eyes show his coolness and he says coldly, "What are you still standing here? Go back."
	This is an ordinary sentence that is very ordinary. In terms of Jamie's usual carelessness, she will not find anything. But this time, she really feels something is wrong.
	It's different from Dan's usual anger that he will kick her ass because she does something bad. Although his tone is very calm, Jamie just thinks that the big boss seems to be angry.
	As for why he is angry, it is unknown.
	"Oh." A little grievance appears in Jamie's heart and she responds. Then she walks towards the door. When she turns to close the door, she glares fiercely at Dan who is back to her. He is really a mad man. Why does he vent his anger to her?
	"Tell me who the person you like is." Get in back to the point. Dan looks at Ryan and asks.
	"Jamie." Ryan is very straightforward. But Dan's complexion suddenly changes as soon as the sentence comes out. And danger appears in his eyes.
	"I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you. Jamie is our designer but not a model. So for your request, I refuse." Dan's voice is low and he refuses bluntly.
	He wants Jamie. Then he may think too much. Does Ryan think that he doesn’t know what they want? He wants to take this opportunity to get close to Jamie. But even if Jamie doesn’t have Dan in his heart now, he won’t give up of Jamie at all.
	Will he form the relationship for Ryan so kindly? Well, it is almost fine if he won’t break it.
	"No matter whether she is designer or models. As long as Jamie is willing, we can create the exhibition with the combination of the best garments and perfume for her identity of being a designer. We will promote the products to the whole country. The profit can be imaged. "Ryan sits upright, looking at the dangerous and mastery man who sits opposite to him. Ryan is also perturbed.
	Judging from the man's possessiveness and domineering style, as long as it is about Jamie, his style will change greatly.
	"Do you think that I will care about these money?" Dan looks at him coldly. His cold lips turn to a sneer, as if he is mocking his overconfidence.
	Although Ryan has expected it for a long time, he still frowns as he hears his words. He continues to look at Dan and says, "Mr. William, do you think it clearly? You and I understand the value of this. If we cooperate, it will a good thing."
	Dan doesn't wait for him to finish talking and stands up. He manages his clothes and responds, "If Mr. Jack thinks that I will cooperate with you for this small profit, you may just look down upon me too much. It’s okay whoever you want. Only for Jamie, you don’t even think about her! "
	After saying, he turns around to leave.
	"It seems that Mr. William really likes Jamie. For her, you can abandon the cooperation with hundreds of millions dollars." Ryan chuckles slightly and his eyes become serious. It seems that he underestimates Jamie's importance in Dan's heart.
	With cooperation of hundreds of millions dollars, if the situation goes well, the profits for the two parties will be more than now. But Dan says that this is a small profit.
	Is Dan just possessive for Jamie?
	Ryan's eyes shows a little complicated feelings. It seems that things have become more and more complicated and even it gradually deviates from his plan.
	"So what?" Dan stops and turns to look at him. What he says is extremely arrogant and domineering. It is just a few words, but it seems to have explained everything.
	He likes Jamie. So what?
	Jamie doesn't like him. So what?
	As long as she stays by his side for one day, he will not believe that she is so foolish that never see how good he is to her. He has that self-confidence that he will make Jamie fall in love with him completely. it’s better to be forever.
Chapter 179 She is Moved
	Dan knows that Ian is the bond that prevents Jamie from leaving. But if he wants to keep her by his side, he can only make her fall in love with him.
	It is better to fall in love with him like he does.
	"Does Mr. William dare to gamble with me once?" Ryan also stands up and stares at Dan's eyes. One of them is a dangerous and quiet man while the other just smiles and is gentle. The temperature inside the room like the combination of ice and fire. No one will lose at all.
	Dan doesn't respond but just looks at him lightly.
	Ryan doesn't care and says, "Mr. William just let Jamie to speak for this exhibition for a week. During this period, Mr. William cannot interfere with our work. If Jamie chooses to come back to you in the end, then I lose. Vice versa."
	"It's a really good way to gamble." Dan smiles quietly and his hands fall in his pocket. He gives Ryan a light look. "But, why do you think I have to gamble with you? And why do you think I will let Jamie go and leave obediently? "
	After talking, a cold and wanton smile appears in the corner of his mouth with a sense of coolness which can’t be ignored.
	Ryan frowns, watching at Dan disapprovingly, "Mr. William, you are forcing Jamie to stay by your side! You don’t respect her personal opinion!"
	Dan snorts and looks at him coldly, saying one by one, "Am I forcing her to stay by my side? You have to open your eyes and see if she is reluctant to stay by my side. Mr. Jack, if you really understand her, how can’t you know what kind of temperament she has? Can I keep her by my side if I force her? "
	He just conspires with Ian to keep Jamie. He just conspires with Ian to let Jamie stay in the manor honestly. Is he forcing her? Dan sneers. Even if he forces her, as long as she can stay here, he can do everything with all means.
	These words successfully make Ryan silent. As Dan says, he knows Jamie well and naturally knows that she is not the kind of person who will do things she doesn’t want to do because of the coercion and temptation of others. She likes freedom. Now she is staying in his side. He’s afraid it's because she is really tempted by Dan.
	After giving Ryan the illusion, Dan doesn't stay and turns to leave the VIP room.
	When he comes out, she sees Jamie grimacing at the door. She doesn't expect anyone to come out suddenly. She is scared and jumps to the side, almost screaming.
	"What are you doing here?" Dan raises his eyebrows and looks at her clearly.
	Although she is silly... she is quite cute.
	Jamie, whose intention is found, feels a bit embarrassed and glances at Dan in a hurry. She quickly lowers her head, "Nothing!"
	She won’t say it is because she is dissatisfied with his attitude so she vents her anger to a door here.
	Is this different from Bruce who will hold the pillar and kisses it in the rumor?
	Dan laughs suddenly, raising his arm involuntarily and rubbing the top of Jamie's hair. And the imperceptible tenderness turns out from his narrow black eyes.
	He thinks about what Ryan says to him just now, and he considers about it again.
	The door behind opens slowly, and Ryan sees the scene as soon as he comes out. Jamie blushes shyly and her cheeks are bulged slightly. She just let Dan rub her head and does not jump up to resist. Ryan is really absent-minded by her rare shyness.
	He has never seen that appearance of Jamie. She brings Ian aside. And she is a girl who is very confident and strong. Even if she is injured, she is so strong that she does not want to be weak in front of others. She is rare to be so shy. .
	But now ...
	"For your proposal, I will agree." Dan says coldly without looking back to Ryan behind him.
	Ryan is startled, and it is strange for Dan's sudden promise. He doesn't say anything but glances at them deeply. Then he steps into the elevator.
	"What proposal?" Jamie asks, frowning at Dan's strange words.
	"Do you want to know?" Dan withdraws his hand and put in his trouser pocket. He looks casual and indifferent. But he walks slowly toward his office.
	Jamie nods like chicken pecking rice behind him although Dan can’t see it. Of course she is really curious in her nature so she wants to know, "YES!"
	Dan walks to the desk and sits on the black office chair, reaching out to pull the collar and untying the two buttons under the collar. It makes a piece of wheat-colored healthy skin exposed. Through his white shirt, you can also see the sturdy abdominal muscles inside and it is really charming.
	Jamie only feels a surge of blood rushing up her head and she almost nosebleeds in front of him. Fortunately she has seen it many times so she can resist. She sniffs and moves her eyes calmly to elsewhere.
	He’s just a tempting devil. She, who is a real woman, is still here. Why does he make such an alluring action? Does he want to show off with her?
	"I’m in a bad mood now, and I don't want to tell you anymore." Dan leans back while his black eyes show his delights. He sees Jamie's expression change but he is really in a good mood.
	How can he not tell her just because of his bad mood?
	Jamie’s hands on the side are clenched into fists. She stares fiercely at the man with a smile in his lips. His expression is clearly showed that he is in a good mood but he just doesn’t want to tell her. It also expresses that she can’t do anything to him although he does so.
	Can he be more rascally?
	Jamie takes a deep breath and restrains the urge to beat Dan. She looks at him with a smile which looks gentle and amiable. It seems to be as beautiful as a flourishing flower. Her voice is also rarely soft. “Then I can wait until you’re happy... "
	Dan raises his eyebrows and squints at her. Well, is the little girl so calm? It is really not her style.
	"Take your damn mood and get away!" The style changes suddenly. Jamie quickly withdraws the smile on her face and instantly turns into a style like man-eating flower. She shouts at Dan loudly.
	After roaring, she stomps heavily and stares at him like an angry cat.
	Dan is helpless but shack his head. His black eyes fix on her slightly angry face and he says mockingly, "Can’t you learn from other girls to speak softly? Can you see which girl acts just like you? Can’t you be coquettish and pout with you small mouth? Should you be so manly?”
Chapter180 She is an Idiot in Love
	After speaking, Dan thinks of Jamie's appearance of stomping and pouting in front of him. Then the gloomy mood that Ryan has just brought to him just disappears.
	Thinking of this, he can’t help but thinks of Jamie has acted coquettishly to once in the hotel that day. It is extremely useful. But unfortunately it happens only when she is drunk. Dan thinks about whether to let her drink someday so that the situation can be happened again.
	Of course Jamie, an idiot in love, won’t think that she will change Dan’s any decisions and thoughts if she puckers her mouth. She just regards what Dan says as to ridicule her. But she secretly remembers that she will never act coquettishly and pout before him!
	This style is too weird and will scare Ian!
	However, Jamie doesn't know it yet. In fact, her coquettish and pouting are more effective for Dan than the kind of resistance.
	"You mean that I am not a lady and not gentle, right? Who those human are if they pucker and act coquettishly?" Jamie steps back in disbelief. Her expression shows that only Dan think that kind of person is normal.
	Dan's mouth twitches. His words are just said only for her. He has known Jamie for so long but he hasn’t seen her coquettish.
	Before that, he asks Derek to get a mouse and throws it into her room. He wants to see her crying with poor appearance and saying to him that there is a mouse.
	What about the result?
	Dan's veins pop abruptly for a few times. He remembers that finally he walks slowly to her room. When Jamie jumps out in shock, he can hold her as if he is passing by. However, he sees Jamie uses two fingers to take the tail of the mouse and comes out curiously. When she sees him, she says, "You still have a mouse at home. It's black and small. It's not cute at all. Also it’s different from what the TV programmer shows."
	Saying that, she uses another finger to poke a few times on the mouse which doesn’t know whether it is dead or alive. Moreover, she accurately throws it into the trash can. After that, she looks at his stiff expression and asks, “What’s wrong?"
	Dan raises his head. He thinks that Jamie is just not afraid of mice. But after his several experiments, he finds that she is not afraid of the natural enemies of girls like cockroaches and reptiles.
	At that time, Dan begins to doubt why the girls yell when they see cockroaches. Maybe they are pretending.
	Jamie is not afraid at all. Why do they need to cry?
	Although Bruce has suggested using snakes, he rejects it finally. He feels that a girl as strong as Jamie should have nothing to fear. If he continues, he might be discovered by her.
	She really dare not imagine the scene of her acting coquettishly towards to him, that style must be very ... thrilling!
	"In the past, Bruce often throws mice, cockroaches, or various reptiles into my room. I'm not afraid at all. Acting coquettishly? I really can't learn that." Jamie waved her hand and doesn't care about it.
	"Bruce?" Dan's eyes flick a little and he fails to understand what Jamie means.
	Jamie snorts and says indignantly, "Yes. He often throws those things into my room, thinking I don't know who he is. I just pretend that I don’t know and I attack him back secretly!"
	Drinking in the Blue Light bar with Duke, Bruce still hugs two beautiful women in his arms and enjoys his life. But suddenly he shudders, and cannot help shivering. The two beautiful women look at him in confusion.
	"It's fine. Come on. Let’s continue to drink." Bruce wants to lower his head and kisses a beautiful woman's face. But when he sees their heavy makeup, he stops. Another face without makeup appears in his mind and it still arouses his desire.
	He actually feels that the two beautiful women in his arms are inferior to the face that can only be described to a formal lady...
	"Well, who let him irritate me?" Jamie raises her chin and don't notice that Dan's strange expression. She still flaunts her achievement rather proudly.
	"But it's a little weird. Bruce doesn't seem to be the kind of person who dares to pluck hair on a tiger's butt? How dare he irritate me again and again?" After she is proud, Jamie begins to feel something wrong.
	If Dan supports her, why does Bruce have the courage to irritate her?
	When Dan hears her words, he begins to be not calm. His left hand unconsciously holds the crystal cufflink on the sleeve of her right hand and he lowers his eyes guiltily.
	"Bruce loves playing tricks. Don't you know? Maybe he just wants to play with you." Dan says in a calm voice. There is nothing strange on his face, and he really blames everything to Bruce.
	Anyway, Bruce already becomes a scapegoat for him so many times. It’s not a big deal for this time...
	
Chapter 181 Being kidnapped
	"Is it?" Jamie tilts her head doubtfully, and she always feels something is wrong. But what Dan says is reasonable. Because Bruce has not overdone anything except throwing mice and bugs into her room. Maybe he really wants to play with her.
	"Well. What are you still standing here? Hurry up and go to Moon." Dan worries that Jamie will discover a problem when he continues the conversation. So he quickly changes the topics and is relieved.
	If he let Jamie know that he is doing this kind of thing in order to make her coquettish to him, she will laugh at sky and say he is naive.
	"Why should I go to Moon?" Jamie's thoughts are led by him smoothly and she looks at him with confusion.
	...
	It is until Moon staff hands her the clothes and she walks into the locker room to change it that Jamie suddenly realizes that what Dan’s agreement and Ryan's proposal are. Probably this is it. Let her take Moon's perfume endorsement. No, to be more precise, it is to promote, not an endorsement...
	After all, Jamie is not a model or a star. So this time it is just publicity, not endorsement.
	The clothes she wears are the clothes she designed for the new product launch but she never let July try on.
	After obsessively listening to those people's suggestions on the shooting content, Jamie knows that it is an exhibition held by Moon in order to further promote their products. This time they do not use the supermodel July but adopts a double-people endorsement. That is, to promote through the lovers.
	The other issues are ready by Moon. Jamie only needs to wear this dress and hold the perfume to according to the routine they set.
	Probably for the first time to do this kind of thing, Jamie feels a little excited in her heart, and tension is inevitable. But when she knows that her partner is Ryan, the tension subsides instantly.
	After all, cooperating with a familiar person is better than partnering with an unfamiliar person. At least, she will not be nervous when facing Ryan.
	But she is more curious that her job is clearly to design. How can Dan think of sending her to advertise these things to others? She is also allergic to perfume. Don't they worry about what will go wrong in the period?
	Of course Jamie doesn’t know that, just as she is approaching Moon, Dan has sent Derek to sterilize the venue and props for shooting the propaganda film, making sure there is nothing but those perfume bottles will make Jamie's skin allergic. Then he feels relived to let Jamie take the shoot.
	For these, Ryan allows it secretly. Because he also worries about Jamie's skin. But he always can’t consider it more thoughtful than Dan’s thoughts.
	However, this behavior makes Moon's employees overestimate Jamie. She can make Dan be so exaggerated and considerate. Won’t she be the woman that Dan is very fond of?
	Today, the main thing is to be familiar with the environment and prepare for some affairs. Jamie’s lines are very few. She just needs to repeat those actions and practice it. There is no big problem.
	Those staff doesn’t dare to approach her because of Dan's management today. So she can have a quiet environment.
	At about six o'clock, Jamie tiredly says goodbye to Ryan, carrying her small leather bag out of the Moon’s building.
	As she walks out of the building, she suddenly remembers that Ian hasn't pick up Ian after school. She looks at the watch on her wrist.
	Ian waits at the school gate for about ten minutes and does not wait for Jamie and Dan to pick him up. From the vehicles passing by, all the people he knows or not will stop and ask if he wants to come together. He politely refuses and continues to wait at the gate.
	The uncle in the guard room is reluctant to see a child waiting here for so long. Therefore, he takes out a small bench for Ian to sit. Ian smiles sweetly and refuses the uncle's kindness.
	He lowers his head and considers for a while. Daddy will come to pick him up every day after work, so he never has to be picked up by the driver. Today Daddy is going to work with Mummy, and Daddy won’t forget the time. Then it is ... mummy.
	Ian's shoulders slouch and he raises his head. His soft and cute face appears a little helplessness. He pulls the strap of the schoolbag up and continues to wait.
	At this moment, a car stops in front of Ian and a black man wearing sunglasses comes out from the car. He bows his head and says to him respectfully, "Ian, Dan send me to take you home."
	Ian glances at the vehicle and then looks at the man in black. He looks indeed like daddy’s person so he nods. The man in black opens the back door for him so that he can enter.
	Ian sits in the back seat and the car starts.
	The car moves smoothly on the road. Ian's eyes rolls around and his eyes stops outside the window. But he sees a completely strange road, which is not the way to home.
	Ian's eyes turns serious and he smiles, "Uncle, this is not the direction of going back to my house."
	"Isn’t it? Ian, you must have a wrong memory." The man in black denies and stares forwards intently.
	"Uncle, you actually want to kidnap me, right?" Ian states, obviously seeing the black man's body froze. Ian wants to say something but suddenly his mouth and nose are covered by a handkerchief which has drugs that will make Ian unconscious for a while.
	Ian rolls his eyes in his heart and becomes fainted after consideration. But his small hand reaches into the side pocket of his backpack before he falls into a coma. He touches a positioning transmitter and presses it.
	The car drives to the remote suburb of City A. The car parks in an open area. The black man comes out from the driver's seat. His another partner hold Ian's back collar and walks out of the car, throwing Ian on the ground.
	The seemingly unconscious Ian moves his mouth slightly and he quickly returns to the former state.
	A man in black says to another man in black, "Call her soon and tell her that he is already in our hands." Then he hands him the phone and urges him.
	"What's the hurry? Are you afraid that he will escape?" The man in black glances at Ian who is lying on the ground and motionless. The model of his mobile phone is produced more than ten years ago. It is difficult to be discovered if they use it to convey information.
	"Hey, we have already got the people you want. When will the money be remitted? ... Okay, we will tie him up now. We can do whatever you want..." The man in black says to the phone for a while before he hangs up the phone.
	
Chapter 182 To Blame Herself
	It turns out that there are still others behind this matter. Ian considers in his mind that why will others attack in terms of his handsome and cute appearance. Maybe they are getting tired of living.
	Ian knows that Night.1 is nearby and with his boldness. He doesn’t scare then too much. He feels that those people takes the rope and tie him around for a few times. Ian moves quietly and feels disgusted in his heart. Are they not afraid of him running away by tying him so loosely?
	When they finish, Ian opens his eyes as if he has just woken up. He looks at the two men in black innocently and says in horror, "Who are you? Why do you tie me up?"
	The soft and cute face is accompanied by a dumb and innocent expression. Ordinary people will definitely feel pitiful if they see his appearance.
	But the two men in black are obviously professionally trained. They are unimpressed. They just sit aside and surround Ian in the middle. Then they close their eyes.
	They are waiting for the person to remit money and kill Ian as soon as they get the money!
	How can Ian not know what they are thinking of? His big eyes turn round again and he indicates Night.1 who stays in the dark not to take action first. He let him just wait and see how long will it take Daddy and Mummy to find him disappeared...
	When Jamie and Dan arrive at school, they hear security guard say that Ian is picked up. Instead of calming down, Jamie's heart jumps faster and faster, as if something bad happens. She let Dan call to home to confirm.
	"Are you sure that Ian hasn't arrived home now?" Dan's voice is cold and his eyes turn serious. His hand which is holding the phone tightens.
	Jamie doesn’t know what is said over the phone. Dan hangs up the phone and walks into the security room. He says to the security guard, "Get the surveillance video out immediately!"
	The security guard is also frightened by his momentum. Without much consideration, he quickly gets out the surveillance video for him.
	After watching the surveillance video, Dan's face turns worse and Jamie's eyes are anxiously fixed on him. Looking at Dan again, she is so anxious that her tears come out of her eyes.
	"Dan, there is news from the Ian’s positioning transmitter." Derek walks to Dan and hands him the phone.
	Dan takes the phone to look. There is a red dot on the landmark. It doesn't move. They seem to have been there for a long time.
	He quickly glances at the exact location and takes Jamie, who is still blaming herself, towards the car.
	As soon as he gets into the car, Dan immediately starts the engine and drives the car with the fastest speed. And the car quickly rushes out.
	Jamie's expression is calm but her pink lips purse heavily. And he doesn't know what she is thinking. But her eyes keep revealing her emotions at this time and her hands are trembling between the legs. And the whole person is filled with guilty and she is helpless.
	Dan sighs and his black eyes flick with serious anger. He stretches out his hand and wraps Jamie's small hand in his hand. He comforts her with his warm his voice. “It’s fine. Derek already let someone to find him. Don’t blame yourself. It’s also my fault. "
	He and Jamie both have responsibilities that they should not let Ian wait so long.
	But the worry in Dan's heart is not as great as Jamie because Jamie doesn't know there is Night.1 around Ian. He follows Ian so closely so Ian will be fine.
	It's just that he wants to know which one is so audacious and dared to attack his son.
	"Well." Jamie feels inexplicably relaxed for a while and a great sense of security surrounds her body. She looks at the big hand that wraps her palm and her eyes suddenly turns gentle. Her sights are tender, like bright crystal, like a charming star.
	In fact at the moment, as long as Dan looks to side, he can see the tender feeling in Jamie's eyes. But unfortunately he does not.
	At the same time, the phones of the two men in black rings and Ian looks at them with innocent eyes. They does not worry about Ian being here, pressing the answer button and putting it next to theirs ear.
	"What? Are we found?" The two men in black look at each other and then fix their eyes on Ian with dangerous meanings.
	Ian's lips twitches and the big eyes flash slyly.
	Daddy is still very fast.
	"Okay, you can drag them out. I will transfer him now ... You better manage it. Otherwise we will be found and die together!" The man in black threatens the man over the phone angrily and he hangs up.
	Ian's eyes flickers and his lips tighten. He looks at the two men in black. This appearance makes him look unpredictable unlike a child.
	"Why do you look at me? Believe it or not, I can dig out your eyes if you still look at me?" The black man grabs Ian's collar fiercely and carries him into the car beside him.
	After a while, the car starts and drives further away.
	And Jamie and Dan are indeed held back.
	The tall building that is about to be built next to the road suddenly collapses, cutting off the road and causing serious traffic jams.
	Although the traffic police are already controlling the situation, it is not a easy matter to clear those obstacles in a few hours and obviously this time the traffic jam is more serious. And it will take at least half a day to completely clear it.
	However, it is impossible for Jamie and Dan to wait so long, nor can Ian.
	Since that the man behind the matter is able to disrupt the traffic with such a big move and successfully drags Dan, this shows that the person has been paying attention to the movement of Dan and Jamie.
	Maybe, Ian is really in danger this time.
	Dan leans his head out to look at the front road. His eyebrows are wrinkled. Then he sits back and unfastens his seat belt. He says to Jamie, "Get out of the car. There is no time."
	Jamie doesn't dare to slack off at all and immediately untie the seat belt to opens the door.
	"Go over there." Dan looks around and his eyes stop at an open space on both sides of the road. He takes Jamie and go towards there.
	"What should I do now?" Jamie looks around and finally sees that the traffic jam is so serious. Not to mention those cars, even the scooters can’t get through. It is really a mess. Almost the traffic polices can’t control the situation.
	"I ask Derek to find someone and he almost reaches." Then, he looks up at the dark sky.
	
Chapter 183 The Man Behind the Matter
	Jamie follows his eyes and sees the helicopters getting closer and closer to them. It quickly reaches on heads. Dan pulls her back a few steps and the helicopter slowly lands.
	Jamie is a little stunned and swallows. It is a helicopter. Is this man so rich and domineering? If the road on the ground is impassable, then they can go by the plane. Can he be more excellent?
	"What are you doing? Go." Dan waits for the plane to be about a meter away from the ground and pulls Jamie to jump into the helicopter with his long legs.
	When the helicopter drives away, Jamie completely regains her mind. She looks back at the traffic below the helicopter, which looks like a long dragon. Overlooking the traffic jam on the road from this height, Jamie’s legs are still a little weak. But she can’t help but wants to see it. It’s a very exciting feeling.
	"Don't move. I don't care if you fall." Dan holds the exciting Jamie and leans over to fasten her seat belt. She can smell a faint fragrance of mint from Dan.
	Smelling the fragrance, Jamie feels that the fear in her heart has eased and she is not so scared. But she dares not look under the helicopter anymore.
	"Dan, Ian's position is moving." Derek sits opposite them, staring at the tablet of the phone and reporting.
	Dan takes out his mobile phone and clicks on it. Sure enough, the punctuation, which is still in a fixed position before, now is moving towards the location of mountain in city A, which is far away from the location just now.
	But no matter how fast it is, it is impossible to win the plane.
	The car is still moving all the way and is already farther away from the road. Ian is tied up and stays in the back seat of the car with a black man. The other is driving in the front.
	Ian's eyes are still looking around and he is analyzing the position of this place. He is thinking about what to do next.
	The man in black on the side stares intently at the front, and does not relax because of the distance, which makes Ian really feel wrong.
	The two men in black behaves like professional underworlds while from their dialogue, they are not.
	If they really just want money, then there’s another problem with the second call when they talk to the person on the phone.
	People who are purely for money do not speak to their employers in that tone, nor do they say so extremely that they want to go to hell together. And people who can waste their lives won’t care about a little money.
	Ian bites his lip, feeling more and more wrong with this matter.
	The car doesn't know drive for how long. After driving to the mountain, they stop in a cave.
	Obviously, it is carefully planned, and even the backup route is clearly arranged.
	This shows that people who want to catch him have been staring at him for a long time.
	Ian is taken out of the car by the man in black and taken to the cave.
	The road is a bit difficult to walk and there are some rocks on it. The man in black is very rude, almost dragging Ian all the way.
	Ian's face doesn't change and he tries hard not to be cut by those sharp stones. So he walks on tiptoe.
	When they reach the cave, Ian turns his eyes to look at the cave in front of him. It is a little dark, and the moonlight just can’t come in.
	"Oops." Perhaps the force of the man in black is too hard. Ian screams and falls on him.
	"Little boy, what are you screaming? Go inside!" The black man pushes Ian coldly to the ground.
	Ian is falling on the ground that is covered with gravel and his ass is uncomfortable. A tingling pain makes his teeth grin.
	Another man in black comes from the side of the car, holding some wood and tools to make fire. It turns out that it is already prepared.
	Such kind of person must not be underestimated.
	Because you don’t know will they be ready for the next step?
	After making a fire, the cave suddenly is lit up, and the flame shines on Ian's soft and cute face.
	Men in black wear sunglasses, and with the faint flame he can only see the bridge of their nose and lips under the sunglasses. Their hair style is the same, and they wear a red earring on their left ear.
	They are very silent. Except for few words that they swear at Ian, they barely talk. There is no expression on their faces, and they look a little stiff.
	Ian even feels that their scolding is their disguise. These two people are not like the vulgar desperado they seem to be but look more like...
	They have received special training!
	Ian has been training with Night.1, and all five of them have tried his best to train him. There is no slack for him although he is a child. Ian has been in contact with them for so long. He feels familiar with this feeling on the men in black.
	"Uncles, aren't you hungry? I'm so hungry." Ian turns his head and says to them. He pursues his mouth, which will make anyone feel pitiful no matter who sees him.
	They ignore Ian. One of them lowers his head and plays with firewood and the other looks at his action silently, as if Ian is transparent.
	"Uncles, why don't you talk?" Ian continues to ask.
	In fact, Ian doesn't want to know something form their mouths, but wants to understand something from their few sentences.
	But the two men clam up greatly that they don't even look at him.
	Ian pouts, and is about to continue. But he hears a rapid ring of cellphone.
	Ian doesn't know what the person on the phone says. Ian only sees the black man's expression frozen. He even looks at Ian like he is going to die. Ian is doubtful at him.
	Is there any terrible order issued by the person behind the matter?
	Ian is curious but he sees the man in black hanging up the phone and turning his head to look at him. He twitches his lips and finally makes an extremely ugly and stiff smile. He looks at him and asks, "What do you want to eat?"
	Ian is stunned and feels weird for sudden change of the man’s attitude. He is sure that it must have something to do with the phone call. But isn't the man's intention to kill him quietly? Why will he still ask him what to eat now?
	As clever as Ian, he is also confusing about their intention. What does that person want to do?
	Looking at the appearance of the man in black, although he is very reluctant, he still has to obey the order of that man. It seems that he will not be in danger for a while.
	
Chapter 184 Can You Sing Little Star?
	Since there is something to eat, Ian Moore will not be polite to them. He said a long list of dishes without pausing, which shocked the two men in black suit.
	They are probably thinking can Ian Moore's little belly can contain so many dishes?
	One man in black suit goes to find food for Ian Moore, while the other stays to keep an eye on him.
	Ian Moore has been staring at him for a long time. Now is a good chance. If Night.1 wants to kill him at the moment, it's just one minute.
	However, Ian Moore’s playful hearts rises and doesn't want to do that for a moment.
	"Hello, can you sing Little Star?" Ian Moore suddenly says. His soft cute face wears a sweet smile and his soft voice makes people feel lovely.
	The man in black shakes his head with a stiff face.
	Ian Moore rolls his eyes. He has a presentiment that even if he makes any request at this time, the man in black would not refuse. More specifically, he doesn’t dare to refuse.
	In order to test the idea, Ian Moore continues says, "but I want to hear it, you need to sing it now!”
	The man in black wants to scold him. But he thinks of the phone call just now, he immediately close his mouth. Then he tries to squeeze out a smile that is worse than crying to look at Ian Moore and says, "OK.”
	How could a man in black sing the Little Star? He secretly scolds the little child as a trouble. He would rather pick the stars for him.
	So there is a scene in the cave. Ian Moore’s rope is untied inadvertently. He takes the man’s phone, finds the Little Star from it, and begins to play it.
	With the music accompaniment, the man in black is expressionless and starts singing with a thick and dense voice. He not only goes out of tune but also sings many wrong words, but he has to only keep on singing.
	The scene is very funny at the time.
	"You sing wrong!” Ian Moore can’t help to shouting when hears that the man in black makes mistakes. Even primary school students can sing this song. The man is so useless!
	The man in black receives Ian Moore's disdainful eyes and touches his nose awkwardly. It was displeasure to be despised by a child.
	"Sing again!" Obviously now the roles are changed. Crinkling his face, Ian Moore is commanding the man in black and plays the music from the beginning.
	He looks down and pretends to play the song, but he slips into the phone contacts and looks at the record on it. There was only one mobile phone number, which is the landline number. Ian Moore has a look and remembers it in heart.
	"Twinkle, twinkle, little star..." The heart of the man in black is almost broken, but he still has to repeats the song, just like in an execution ground, spits out the lyrics slowly, dare not makes any more mistakes.
	With a cold face of the Night.1 watches in the dark. The young master is really optimistic. In this atmosphere, he could also ask the man in black to sing twinkle twinkle little stars to him.
	Is he too bold, or he has other ideas?
	At the end, when Ian Moore asks the man in black to sing again and again, the man in black could hold the rhythm of the song and has to take his emotions with it.
	Ian Moore looks at the mobile phone in his hand, stands up, turns around the man in black, and says, "Nice, Well done. You already have a good sense of rhythm. Go on."
	Such Ian Moore looks like a little teacher, as if he is pointing out his students.
	But afraid that he will feel sick when he listens to this song again.
	"Ah! " Ian Moore turns around. He doesn't know what he steps on. He jumps forward. His mobile phone is thrown out for several meters and smashes on the rocks.
	As soon as the man in black see it, he run to pick up the mobile phone, and see that the old mobile phone has been broken and all the parts have come out, the buttons have been broken, and the screen has also been broken. The miserable appearance can't be seen to use again.
	It is that Ian Moore doing it on purpose.
	Without cell phone, how yours get in touch?
	The man in black looks at Ian Moore with a gloomy face. The little face of Ian Moore, which is just gloating, is full of tears and begins to cry.
	"I don't do it on purpose..."
	Ian Moore is also clever. Knowing that the man in black may find out that he intentionally drops his cell phone, he quickly grins to show his weakness, which would block the words behind the man in black in black in his throat.
	Even if he may doubt him, Ian Moore has another reason, that is, he is a child.
	Can an ordinary child have such a heavy mind and strength?
	The man in black obviously put Ian Moore in the position of ordinary children, so he is destined to be played with by Ian Moore
	"You...don't cry.” The man in black has some doubts, but when Ian Moore cries, he feel that his doubts are superfluous, just a child. How could he think of the plan and destroy the mobile phone?
	So it can only be explained by carelessness.
	In addition, the phone call just now makes the man in black not dare to make troubles. Ian Moore’s crying is just like a disaster.
	"Uncle, would you blame me?" Ian Moore looks at the man in black through his fingers and asks pitifully.
	When the man in black twitches his mouth and says, "Nope.”
	"Thanks.” Ian Moore put down his small hand, which covers his eyes. There is trace of crying in his bright big eyes. Looking at the man in black, his eyes full of hope and says. "Uncle, keep singing twinkle twinkle little star!"
	Hearing this, the man in black almost fainted. Now he is almost vomiting when he hears song’s name!
	"Can not to sing?" The man in black struggles for a long time. Looking at Ian Moore’s soft angel face, he feels that such a child would be fooled by coaxing.
	Ian Moore thinks with his head askew, then seems like think of something and says, "But you need to find something for me."
	"What?" The man in black breathes a sigh of relief. He can do anything better than sing the twinkle twinkle little star.
	"It's said that you can summon the fairy if you gather seven fruits with different colors. Uncle, go and find seven fruits with different colors for me." Ian Moore nodded solemnly, quite satisfied with his proposal.
	Seven fruits? Fairy?
	What the hell is that!
	Thanks to the high professional quality of the man in black, he doesn’t speak some dirty words out. He secretly scolded what Ian Moore’s head full of messy things, and he has to leave the cave to find fruits, so no one looks at him.
Chapter 185 Be Sincerely Convinced
	"Of course, you don't have to worry about me running away, because I am a child, and now it's dark again, where can I run?" Ian Moore sees his thoughts and blinks his eyes innocently. It makes people think it's really a harmless child.
	The man in black thought for a while and thought Ian Moore makes sense, and how far a child could run even if he runs.
	So he says to Ian Moore, "You must not move." Then she stands up and leaves the cave.
	Ian Moore throw out his tongue, the expression on his face chills out for a moment, and watches the surroundings carefully. He doesn't sure if that person sends someone to stare at him in the dark.
	Night.1 knows what Ian Moore is worried about, shakes his head at him, he has checked, and had been observing the movements around him. His sharp senses and accumulated training allowed him to find out if someone had entered this area.
	Ian Moore nods gently, and a cunning smile appears on the corner of his mouth. Since there is no one, what are you waiting for?
	He walks to the shattered phone of a man in black and shook his head. He thought they were really cautious, maybe he was afraid of accidentally seeing and discovering the information inside.
	But this is a piece of cake for Ian Moore.
	It don't take long for him to find a calling card from the shattered phone. Fortunately, there is not much damage, and he still has a way to repair it.
	He sandwiches the card between his fingers, then flicks his finger, and throw the phone card in the direction of Night.1.
	Night.1 is surprised when he saw Ian Moore’s series of actions. Looking at the phone card in his hand, a sigh of relief appears in his eyes.
	He doesn't expect that in a short time, Ian Moore could control his strength and direction so well. He is quick, ruthless, and accurate, and his shot is neat. A child as young as five years old could be so powerful.
	This makes Night.1 convinced that they did not see the wrong person, let alone follow the wrong person.
	Ian Moore does have the ability to convince the five of them.
	After doing all this, Ian Moore smashes the phone to the ground and restores it to its original appearance, and then walks back to the cave when there is no problem.
	In fact, he can leave with Night.1 now, but he wanted to figure out who is behind him, so he decided to stay.
	Ian Moore holds his chin and thought, if that person really wants to treat him, he can do it directly, why is it so troublesome to transfer him.
	Moreover, the different attitudes and manners of the two men in black before and after are also very strange. It can be seen that the man gives orders to them, and they are not allowed to take action against themselves.
	Is it two people?
	However, not any people in City A know about his existence, and even if they know it, it is impossible for him to start.
	Is the problem with whom?
	Their second conversation is also questionable.
	Ian Moore certainly wouldn't think that the two men kidnapped him simply for money.
	The man in black who is sent by Ian Moore to buy food come back, but he only sees Ian Moore sitting there obediently, looks around, and say, "What about him? "
	Ian Moore listens to him, raised his eyes, and looks at him gleamingly. His face is innocent and simple, "You said that uncle? He gives me seven fruits, and then I can summon the fairy! "
	He also waves his hand in excitement.
	The man in black's eyes jumps fiercely, suddenly feeling a cold sweat rising behind him, crouching down and placing the bags with food boxes in front of Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore’s eyes lit up. He opens the bag, takes out a box, opened it, and looks at the shiny crystal shrimp dumplings inside. It is also polite. He takes a chopstick and put it in his mouth.
	He sounds while eating.
	"Uncle, I think you seem to be very busy." Ian Moore eats the gap and looks up at the man in black who is there like a wooden stake, and spoke casually.
	The man in black doesn't move, only feels that Ian Moore wouldn't do anything good if he asks suddenly.
	"Well, uncle, will you dance belly dance?" Ian Moore blinks his eyes wide, and looks at him innocently, but how his eyes looks, how evil.
	"..." The man in black is silent, and wants to reject Ian Moore’s unreasonable request, but when he thinks of the phone call just now, his scalp tingled.
	"Any of his requests, if you can't complete it, you never have to come back."
	This is the man's original words.
	Don’t return, not let them leave here, but let them never come back.
	"Child, can you change one?" The man in black squatted down and stared at Ian Moore, his smile stiff, but also because Ian Moore is not an ordinary child, otherwise he would have been scared and crying.
	"Uncle, don't you want to?" Ian Moore looks at him innocently, his eyes flashes with water mist, and looks at him pitifully.
	As if he dares to say something he doesn't want in the next second, Ian Moore would cry immediately.
	The man in black's mouth twitches, and he could only say: "Yes.”
	"So what are you waiting for? Go jump for a while. It's a good jump. There is a reward." Ian Moore claps his hands and looks at him expectantly.
	The man in black actually really ties up his shirt and ties it above the abdomen and starts to dance. He shows a large piece of strong abdominal muscles. At first glance, he is a person who practiced his family all year round.
	There is a surprise in Ian Moore’s eyes. If such a tall man, if he is really a member of a certain force, why would he still has belly dance, and he does well?
	Ian Moore hurriedly claps his hands and applauds, "Good, great!"
	This picture is as happy as it looks.
	A big man with big arms twisting his abdominal muscles, the hand that originally held the gun is swinging on both sides, how this picture makes people laugh.
	If it isn't that he doesn't have a mobile phone in his hand, his backpack is confiscated again, and Ian Moore has to record it and turns back to let Jamie Moore also has a look.
	A ring of cellphone rings, one after another.
	Ian Moore is stunned. How come there is a mobile phone?
	The man in black immediately stops when he heard the ringtone, then takes out his phone from his trouser pocket and answers.
	"What? Okay, got it." The man in black said to the mobile phone, looking at Ian Moore who is more and more dangerous.
	Ian Moore groans, and as the man in black hung up his phone, Ian Moore immediately stands up and runs toward the cave with his short legs.
	
Chapter 186 Gamble
	He has a premonition that if he is catches by the man in black at this time, the consequences will be…
	Look at the expression of the man in black, the man seems to give them an order to start against him.
	Ian Moore’s speed is very fast. Before the man in black comes near the cave, the little figure rushes out of the flash and run down the hillside outside.
	"Damn it!" The man in black doesn't expect Bunny to resist suddenly. He comes back and runs after him.
	Another man in black goes back to the cave and holds several fruits of different colors, but he doesn't see people in the cave. He thinks of something, throws down the fruits and runs out.
	Ian Moore’s speed is very fast, but no matter how fast she is, she is not as fast as an adult man with long legs. A few strides come to her.
	"Son of bitch, do you believe I'll kill you now?" Without the order of the upper layer, the man in black is reckless, grabs Ian Moore’s back collar and says viciously.
	"Uncle, I can't understand what you are taking about." Bunny is still smiles sweetly. He looks at him softly, but there is a chill in him eyes.
	"You…" The man in black wants to scold, he finds something on his stomach. He looks down subconsciously, and his pupils suddenly constrict!
	It's a small silver pistol, right against his belly, ready to go!
	The man in black sneers and looks at Bunny sarcastically. "Toy pistol? If you have the ability, shoot please."
	Ian Moore’s soft and sweet smile quickly subsides. Instead, it was endless cold. Look at the man in black, it is like looking at the dying man, "Are you sure?"
	"A little boy, don't be here… Hum." The man in black wants to laugh at her. Suddenly, he feels a stabbing pain in his thigh. He can’t make a sound until he stops.
	Looking down, he is shots in the middle of his thigh. The blood is flows down. Because it is black pants, it is not obvious. The only thing we can see is that the blood flow down his thigh to the ground and quickly dye the mud under his feet red.
	A loose finger of the man in black, Ian Moore struggles and falls on the ground. She steps back, with a cold condensation on her small face. Look at the man in black, him eyes are like a king look down at a mole ant.
	Ants.
	The man in black is bits his teeth. When he touches his trouser leg, Bunny knows what he is going to do. Before he takes out the pistol hidden in his trouser leg, Ian Moore quickly puts a posture and mends the gun towards to the man in black.
	The sound of bullets passes through the flesh, especially pleasant.
	The man in black is shocked. They don't expect that the five-year-old they kidnapped is so terrible!
	Don't blink when shooting. Be quick and accurate.
	The man in black is shot twice. The bone of his right hand is hit. He can't even use his strength. His thigh is still bleed. Every shot of Ian Moore is purposeful, not a random waste of a bullet.
	"Son of bitch!" The man in black quickly takes a pistol out of his trousers with his left hand, and then aims it at Bunny with the black muzzle.
	Ian Moore pick up him eyebrows. He looks at the man in black with cold eyes and frowned. Then he opens him mouth and show a row of white teeth. He says, "Uncle, do I tell you that I don't like people point guns at me?
	"Sniff, then you can try whether your bullet is fast or mine." The man in black catches the pistol and hurt his right hand. He could only grasp it with his left hand. His breath is cold. He looks at Ian Moore with a little fear.
	Such a small child has such a good shoot skill. If he grows up in the future,
	He will have no choice.
	So we must destroy him before he grows up!
	The man in black seems to understand the man's orders.
	"Then try it." Ian Moore’s little face is not scary. He raises him chin and looks at him confidently.
	In the dark night, a hand tightly clenched. If it isn't for Ian Moore to ask him not to go out, he would has rush to takes Ian Moore to a safe place.
	It's just look for death!
	The man in black obviously receives special training from childhood. Even to this point, he can't be despised. Although Ian Moore hit him twice before, it is because he gets it when the man in black relaxed his vigilance.
	If it is so face-to-face, one-on-one, with Ian Moore’s immature shoot method, we can only die!
	This is to gamble with him life. If you want to shoot, you will lose!
	Night.1 is impossible to allow Ian Moore to do such dangerous things. He even regrets giving the silver pistol to him. He just wants to defend himself. How could he do this?!
	Do you want to die?!
	Night.1 was anxious and wants to go out of the dark, but in the acceptance of Ian Moore that wipe his reassuring eyes to stop, eyes with an order can’t be refused.
	Ian Moore asks him not to interfere.
	That is to say, Bunny has to gamble with the man in black.
	Night.1 frowns and thinks that whether he should let Ian Moore bet so once.
	It's not that Night.1 didn't trust Ian Moore so much, but this gamble method, either you die or I live. Ian Moore is tries with the fate of five people. If he dies, five of them can only thank for their death.
	Even if Ian Moore is smart, he can't compare with a person who has receives professional training.
	The chance is too slim.
	Night.1 sigh, eyes tightly stares at Ian Moore’s position, have be ready to find Ian Moore has a trace of danger, jump over for him to block the preparation.
	Ian Moore and the man in black are almost two meters apart. The gun is faces each other. The cold and horrible breath is spread in this area, and the cold and dark flame is burn.
	The man in black looks at Ian Moore’s eyes and dare not slack off any more. He holds his hand tightly with his left hand to make sure that Bunny can hit the target in a short time.
	"Who are you?" Asks the man in black.
	It's also true that it doesn't look like the mental quality and ability a child should have, but him appearance is clearly a small fart child.
	What kind of organization is this?
	Ian Moore looks at him innocently and innocently with a wink at the corner of him mouth. It's this look that deceives the two men in black. He doesn't notice it at all.
	"Uncle, your pants are off." Ian Moore’s smile is still sweet and looks harmless.
Chapter 187 Daddy, are You in Pain?
	But when it comes to this, the man in black can no longer believe that Ian Moore is a harmless boy.
	"Cut the crap and get started." The man in black is cold, the gun in his hand is ready to fire, no one knows when the bullet will pop out of the chamber.
	Ian Moore squeezes his little mouth and looks at the man in black with ease, apparently he is despised.
	Skittish, disdain, these feelings gatherers in his eyes, but let the man in black man has a sense of panic.
	He does not like to admit it, but the way Ian Moore looks at him. It does give him some chills and made his fingers tremble.
	Now all the man in black can see is Ian Moore’s eyes, which is full of emotions, which is like big invisible hands, holding his heart and shaking.
	The man in black slightly distract, after a second to find that he is gambling life with Ian Moore, a moment of distraction may be going to kill him.
	But when he opens his eyes, he sees a bullet shining with cold light straight at his chest. It seems to slow down a lot!
	Even so, the man in black can't avoid it.
	The bullet goes straight through his chest without spilling a drop of blood.
	The man in black looks at Bunny in astonishment, he is so shocked, his pistol fell to the ground with a slight thud.
	The pistol has been pointed at his own chest.
	Because of the location, Ian Moore sees it clearly, but Night.1 does not see, and thought, is Ian Moore shots.
	"It's taboo to lose your mind when you're fighting the enemy." Ian Moore still smiles sweetly and softly, and his words drifted into the ears of the man in black.
	The kid with soft and handsome face in the eyes of the man in black, like the general death, let him die easily.
	In the duel of life, if the man in black does not die, then Ian Moore must die.
	The Night.1 shakes his head gently, sighing with some felicity.
	Ian Moore is too early exposure to these, which they do not want to see.
	They always think that under their protection, Bunny can live a life without worry.
	But now, still let him face these alone, perhaps their thought is too good, think Ian Moore will be willing to be protected by them, but they do not know, he will grow.
	But the way of growing up, too cruel.
	The man in black falls to the ground, his eyes wide open under the sunglasses, and do not know how he has died.
	In fact, Ian Moore just uses Night.7 taught him the psychology of war, plus the man in black is injured and weak, so Bunny effortless aims at his chest, and then shoots himself.
	It is harder than just shooting and killing him.
	Ian Moore puts the pistol away, wipes the sweat from his forehead, and breathes a sigh of relief.
	This is really a bet on life, if the man in black willpower is a little stronger, now it is estimated that he died.
	Luckily, I don't get my hands covered in blood.
	Ian Moore looks at his soft little hands and smiles, for the sake of mommy and daddy, he would not let himself get a drop of blood on hand now.
	That's why he takes the risk.
	"Baby!" Jamie Moore’s voice comes from overhead, a sudden gust of wind blew under Ian Moore’s feet, he sees a helicopter flying among the rocks and sand.
	And the tearful face of Jamie Moore’s with tearful eyes.
	As his heart warmed, Ian Moore holds out his hands to Jamie Moore, smiling sweetly, "mommy."
	At that moment, two cold bullets seem to break through the air and hit towards Ian Moore’s position, one after the other, they are sure to kill Ian Moore.
	As the helicopter descends, he sees a man in black lying close to Ian Moore, holding a black pistol points at his position.
	"No" Jamie Moore’s face turns pale with fear and starts to jump, but somehow she backs away and falls back into the helicopter.
	Before Jamie Moore reacts, she sees just in his side of Dan William jumps, this time the helicopter is only about ten meters from the ground.
	Jamie Moore immediately puts out her head to see that Dan William’s figure fast like ghosts, on the ground rolls a few circles to Ian Moore side, with his own body tightly hugs Ian Moore prone on the ground.
	Jamie Moore’s lips parts in shock, she can see clearly on the plane that Dan William has not dodged two bullets, one through his shoulder and the other right in his arm.
	Eyes immediately some hot, nose is acerbic, Jamie Moore also does not wait for the helicopter to land completely, immediately jumps from above, follows by Derek William.
	Due to body instability, Jamie Moore accidentally falls when she arrives in the land, grazes the knee and arm, but she seems unaware of it and runs to Dan William and Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore is protected in the arms of Dan William, two bullets are stopped by Dan William, so he does not get any harm.
	He is just very distressed.
	He does not expect that it is not he who has saved himself at the last moment, nor is it Night.1, but belated Dan William.
	He doesn't expect to get hurt, also he doesn't expect another man in black to be lurking nearby.
	He is too careless to give them a chance.
	Ian Moore’s eyes slightly cold, vows to find out the man behind, and then puts his father's injuries back to him!
	"Daddy, are you in pain?" Ian Moore looks at Dan William slightly pale pretty, the eye sockets are hot and wet.
	He seldom cried, sometimes for the sake of acting and not really.
	But now he really wants to cry.
	"No, daddy feels good." Dan William touches his little head and pulls a smile out of his mouth.
	Even in this situation, he can smile with a face of pure grace, charming to the extreme.
	But the pallor of his lips betrayed him.
	How could he not in pain.
	But Dan William really does not feel much, just feel he cannot let Ian Moore distressed, even if his consciousness has begun to chaos.
	He knows that if anything happened to Ian Moore, she would feel bad, he would feel sad deep in his heart also, so if it is himself who injured, at least it would have made Jamie Moore’s heart ache less.
	"Dan William, how are you?" When Jamie Moore runs to their side, his brain has been in a blank state, the whole person some delirium.
	"Daddy, daddy!
	"Dan William..."
	As he closes his eyes, he hears the two voices.
	Another man in black is solved by Derek William, the helicopter carrying Dan William, Jamie Moore and Ian Moore goes to the hospital.
	
Chapter188 Look after Dan William
	Jamie Moore stares at the operating room, looking at the red lamp. There seems to be some confuse in her eyes and some sadness.
	It happens so suddenly that she is overwhelmed by surprise.
	First Ian Moore is kidnapped, and then Dan William is injured.
	All of these have left her brain in a state of standby.
	Ian Moore goes to the restroom, leaving Jamie Moore in the empty passage. The light shines on her, giving him a sense of loneliness.
	Jamie Moore doesn't know where the pain comes from when she sees Dan William getting injured. She just feels anxious and worried; she can't calm herself down for a long time.
	On the other side, in the staircase, Ian Moore looks at Night.1 with such cold eyes for the first time, without any emotion.
	Night.1 looks directly into his eyes with silence. He has already known what Ian Moore will say to him next.
	"When the bullets come to my daddy and me, why don’t you prevent them? Night.1, I believe you have the ability to stop it. Give me a reason."
	Ian Moore looks at Night.1 with disappointment.
	Night.1 knows that Ian Moore will realize his little trick sooner or later, but he doesn't know that it will be so fast.
	Yes, he can prevent that black man before the bullets are fired, but he doesn't.
	In other words, he is on purpose.
	"No reason." Night.1 lowers his head, and replies respectfully. There is no emotion in his face. It seems that he doesn't plan to explain.
	Jamie Moore sneers softly, "No reason? It's OK, let Night.7 replace you. I don't need a subordinate who is not loyal to me. "
	Ian Moore is really angry this time, he says nothing more and turns away.
	Ian Moore’s base line is Dan William and Jamie Moore, no one can hurt them. Otherwise, no matter who they are, he will make their life miserable!
	But Ian Moore isn't ruthless to Night.1; he just let Night.1 go back, which means that he will no longer trust him.
	Night.1 sighs slightly, standing there and leaning against the wall, and then he takes out a cigarette to light and smokes heavily.
	In his mind, a picture of ubiquitous blazing flames gradually comes up. No one can escape from the house surrounded by fire.
	It is his nightmare.
	When Ian Moore comes back to the operating room, he sees that Jamie Moore is glaring at the lamp in the operating room. He feels a sharp pain in his heart. He walks over and gently hugs her, saying, "Mommy, don't worry, daddy will be fine."
	"Well." Jamie Moore touches his hair, and there is an indelible worry in her eyes.
	After three or four hours of operation, Dan William is pushed into an advanced ward.
	The bullets don't hit the vital part of his body. One of them goes through his back. Fortunately, it doesn't hit his heart, so there is no danger to his life; and he just need to stay in the hospital for further inspection.
	"The patient's wound is on his back and arms; he can't touch water during this period. Just wipe him with a towel." The doctor told Jamie Moore, and she listens and remembers.
	"What? Wipe his body?" Jamie Moore can't believe when she hears these words, why need to wipe? And why is her?
	"You’re the wife of him, aren’t you? You have children, what else to be shy? Well, that's all I have to say. Just ring the bell if you have any questions." The doctor takes a look at her, and then looks at Ian Moore again, and then he shakes his head, turns around and leaves the ward.
	Who can count the shadow area of Jamie Moore’s heart?
	"Mommy, daddy gets hurt because of me. If you don't help daddy, I will snub you." Ian Moore shakes Jamie Moore’s arms and sadly looks at Dan William, who is lying on the bed.
	If Mommy doesn't help daddy, it's not a big deal. He's an expert at housework. There's nothing he can't do.
	"Not, is Mommy like that ungrateful person? Just...” Jamie Moore looks at Dan William, who is lying there motionless with a pale face, still handsome as a picture, and swallows saliva with her small face red.
	You know, the man is so attractive even when he is in a coma. She is afraid that she can't control herself!
	"Does mummy worry that she can't control herself?" Ian Moore sees through Jamie Moore's mind, mainly because the expression on Jamie Moore’s face is so obvious that it's easy to see through.
	Jamie Moore’s face suddenly becomes redder, and gives Ian Moore a look of anger, "Who says that? Does your mommy look like a woman with no morals? I'm just worrying about hurting him. "
	Ian Moore really wants to nod and say yes, but under the threat of Jamie Moore, it's better to save his life.
	Mommy, your expression clearly says that you want to sleep with daddy. Why be shy?
	He believes that daddy will be happy to sleep with mommy.
	Jamie Moore looks heroic and goes to Dan William and reaches for the temperature on his forehead. It's cold. It seems well.
	Have a fever is always hot.
	Ian Moore leaves the ward, leaving the room for Jamie Moore and Dan William. He is mainly worrying that his mother may be embarrassed to work because of his existence.
	It's almost early in the morning. Ian Moore goes back to the manor. He is going to come back at dawn.
	Jamie Moore keeps beside Dan William’s bed and forces herself not to fall asleep, so she props up her eyes with her hands, then stares at Dan William’s handsome face, trying to use this to drive away the sleepiness.
	But the effect is not very good. Jamie Moore’s eyelids fall together, her head can't help nodding. It seems that she will fall in the next second.
	Boom, Jamie Moore’s forehead hit on the edge of the bed and she suddenly feels a tingle. She is so painful that is no longer sleepy.
	She touches her painful forehead, reaching out to explore the temperature of Dan William, and then remembers what the doctor said and swallows saliva.
	Thinking for a while, Jamie comes into the bathroom. Then she comes out with a white wet towel in her hand, then she goes to the bedside and opens the quilt, then she closes her eyes, lifting Dan William’s clothes, and wipes his body.
	In order to not hurt his wound, Jamie Moore wipes very slowly and carefully. It's just that the closed eyes of Jamie Moore are completely opened after wiping.
	While wantonly appreciating the muscles that Dan William exercises all the year round, she mooches him by the way.
	Wow, it's so nice!
	Jamie Moore squints her eyes. She's not an indecent woman, but with such a handsome man around, who is stationary and is under her control, Jamie Moore feels guilty if she doesn't make sexual advances.
	
Chapter 189 Why Hasn’t Your Daddy Woken up Yet?
	Well, she was too kind after all.
	If Dan is awake at the moment, he must feel it funny when looking at Jamie’s expression.
	Although he has not woken up, his consciousness is very clear, and he can feel that there a hand touching his body, and he can hearing some sighing.
	And Dan feels unhappy. He thinks that he will not forgive that person after he wakes up.
	After wiping Dan’s whole body, Jamie wipes the sweat on her forehead, puts aside the towel and stretches a lazy waist.
	Now, she can take a rest for a while.
	Then, she lays down on the edge of the bed and falls asleep on her arm.
	In her dream, she is spoiled by Dan again.
	The next morning, the sun shines through the screen window into the ward, so most of the wards light up.
	Jamie lies by the bed with her face on its side, sleeping quietly and elegantly, like a white gardenia.
	The sun is shining upon her curling lashes, which quiver slightly like a butterfly, casting a shadow over her eye sockets; and her nose and lip are hidden between her hands. She looks so childish and lovely that she seems to be a fairy suddenly descending to earth.
	The sun is getting hotter and the temperature in the room is rising, too, but Jamie doesn't wake up.
	Suddenly, the door of the ward is opened, which makes Jamie frown in her sleep.
	Then she hears Ian’s voice carrying a kind of blame, “aunt, please be careful, daddy needs to rest, and you will wake up him.”
	“Sorry, I'm so excited.” Amelia apologies quietly, which makes Jamie wonder that why she becomes so friendly.
	Jamie’s eyelids twitch a few times, and then she slowly opens her eyes. Since she has just woken up, she is a little hazy.
	When Ian walks into the ward, he sees that Jamie is waking up. Then he walks at a brisk pace toward Jamie and kisses he, “Good morning, mommy.” Then he hands the bag to Jamie, which contains Jamie’s clothes.
	“Good morning, baby. I have not washed my face.” Jamie rubs her eyes, yawns, takes the bag, and walks into the bathroom as if she hasn’t seen Amelia.
	Amelia does not feel it strange that Jamie is also in the ward. She goes to look at Dan and finds that Dan has recovered a lot. But he is still in a coma, perhaps he is sleeping.
	“Ian, how can your daddy not wake up? Is that OK?” As Dan’s sister, Amelia worries about Dan.
	And she has never seen such appearance of Dan. In her memory, Dan has been strong and domineering. He rarely goes to the hospital even though he is sick.
	He's lying here, which means he's badly hurt.
	“It's all right. The doctor says that daddy needs a rest and that he will wake up soon.” Ian sits on the soft chair beside the bed. He also worries that Dan cannot wake up. But even if he does not wake up, he cannot pinch his father like his mother.
	Jamie pinches Dan means that she really worries about him. What an excuse!
	“Well.” Amelia covers Dan with a quilt. Suddenly, she thinks that she has forgotten to buy some fruit. Then she talks to Ian, “Ian, I’ll go out and be back soon.”
	“OK.” Ian smiles at her and sees that Amelia goes out of the ward.
	In fact, he does not want his mom to meet with Amelia, because he knows that they cannot get along well with each other.
	Ian rolls his eyes. But it is a pity that he does not know why his mom would break off with Amelia. Otherwise, he can help to solve the problem.
	Jamie takes a shower, changes her clean clothes and feels comfortable.
	When she comes out, she does not see Amelia, but she says nothing. She goes to kiss Ian.
	“Did you help wipe my father’s body?” Ian smiles and asks.
	Well, he really wants to know how his mom was feeling when she wiped his dad’s body.
	Jamie’s eyes flicker, and then she looks around the ward. She does not know how to answer Ian’s question.
	If she says yes, Ian will laugh at her for flirting Dan. If she says no, Ian must cry and complains that she lies to him.
	So all answers are wrong...
	Then, Jamie holds Ian in her arms, and glares at him, “What are children asking these questions for? You want me to beat you?”
	“No. I know you want to change a topic.” Ian looks at Jamie curiously.
	“Do you say no? Do you bring breakfast to me? I stay up all night to take care of your dad but you sleep in the house.” Jamie pokes her finger into Ian’s head.
	Ian bites his lips. Doesn’t his mother complain anything? Does she stay up all night? But what is she doing just now? Is she thinking anything about life?
	“But I also come here without having breakfast. I worry about my dad.” Ian says with a grievance and he touches his belly. He looks poor.
	Jamie laughs out, pinches his little face and says, “Do you feel wronged? Your father will be served when he wakes up. Let’s go. I will take you out to eat something delicious.”
	“Is that really all right?” Ian hesitates. Dan is still lying in the bed. If he goes out to enjoy delicious food, isn’t it too cruel?!
	“It’s fine. Nothing serious.” Jamie pats Ian’s paws and carries him out of the ward without putting him down.
	“Mom, let me down, it’s so embarrassing...” Ian feels shy.
	But Ian has forgotten that he is only five years old.
	Dan is lying on the bed consciously. He hears clearly what Jamie and Ian talks about. He feels very anxious and even wants to wake up to catch them back when he hears that they will leave them to enjoy delicious food.
	But Dan is very cunning. And he knows that he can’t wake up. And there is nothing bad lying on the bed.
	Dan regards it as a way to catch up on sleep.
	As soon as Jamie goes out of the ward with Ian, Amelia comes back with some fruit. Then she feels angry when knowing that they are out.
Chapter 190 It is not the Best Time
	Dan is lying in the bed because of Ian. But she does not take care of Dan and go out. What an indifferent woman!
	Amelia gives Jamie a label with an indifferent woman, and then she puts the fruit on the table.
	“Well!” Amelia thinks that she can call Jozo to take care of her brother if Jamie is out, which can help improve their friendship.
	Then, she calls Jozo.
	Jamie comes to a restaurant with Ian. And it is time for lunch. She orders a children’s meal for Ian.
	After enjoying their delicious lunch, they go out of the restaurant.
	Ian touches his belly and feels satisfied. He takes a bag for Dan’s lunch. If he wakes up, he can just eat it.
	“Let’s go back.” Jamie squints and looks up at the hospital. She is a little worried.
	Oh, what’s wrong with her recently?
	Jamie enters into the hospital and walks to the VIP ward where Dan is in after getting out of the elevator.
	“Well, you are here.” Bruce and Duke come out from the ward and greet with Jamie and Ian.
	Last night when Dan and Jamie found that Ian was kidnapped, they did not tell Bruce and Duke. They are told by Derek and then they come to the hospital immediately.
	“What are you doing here?” Jamie frowns, thinking that they are really well informed and have come here so soon.
	“Dan is injured, so we come to visit him.” Bruce turns to look at the door of the ward. He dares not to look at Jamie’s eyes.
	He is such a man who is unable to hide himself. So he worries that he may say something wrong and that no one can help him.
	“You’d better not go in now. It's useless because Dan does not wake up.” Duke says and looks at Jamie seriously.
	Jamie is surprised. It is the first time she has ever seen Bruce say so many words in such a sentence. Jamie has a strange feeling about both of them today.
	Ian sees Night.7 waving to him behind a wall, and then he shakes Jamie’s arms and says, “Mom, I want to go to the toilet. And I will come back soon.”
	“Go ahead.” Jamie nods.
	When Ian leaves, Jamie puts her hands around her chest and frowns, saying, “What do you want to do? Why don't you let me get in?”
	“I do not want to stop you, but I don’t think it’s the best time for you to go into...” Bruce answers quickly, saying what he wants to say.
	Duke wrenches Bruce’s arms, interrupting the conversation. Bruce shouts in pain.
	Jamie squints. Duke’s behavior makes her more suspicious.
	Dan is still lying there. They even try to stop her to get in to take care of Dan. They are so suspicious.
	Looking at Jamie’s suspicious glance, Bruce even wants to whip himself on face.
	Then Jamie looks at them for a moment. Suddenly, she gets through between them with her small body, though the space is a little bit narrow.
	Is it the way that they try to stop her?
	“Wait!” Bruce wants to pull Jamie back in hurry. But Jamie moves so fast that she arrives at the door of the ward.
	Duke shakes his head, looking at Jamie’s back helplessly. For they have tried their best, so no matter what happen in the future, it has nothing to do with them.
	Jamie opens the door of the ward and wants to get into. Suddenly, she stops walking, standing there with a daze in her eyes.
	In the ward, besides Dan, there is another person.
	Jozo sits on the wheelchair near Dan’s bed, and wipes his face gently, like a little girl who is taking good care of her own lover.
	The sun comes in through the window and shines on them, but it is very harsh for Jamie.
	Jamie feels surprised and just looks straight ahead.
	Jozo bends over to kiss Dan for a moment. It can be found that her face turns red. She seems to fall in love with Dan.
	Jamie blinks her dry eyes, not knowing whether to get in or leave.
	In fact, she is not happy. Even if Dan is still in a coma now, she thinks that this is a kind of disrespect for Dan.
	The reason why she is unhappy is that Dan is Ian’s daddy.
	Isn’t it?
	Jamie shuts her mouth and looks at them dully. She should have thrown Jozo out, but now she realizes that she has no right to do that.
	It seems she has no other relationships with Dan except that she is Ian’s mommy.
	And in what identity can she throw Jozo out?
	Jamie bites her lips and turns to look at Dan for a moment. Then, she closes the door silently and leaves.
	When she turns around, she does not notice that Jozo, who has been smiling shyly, suddenly looks up and smirks toward Jamie.
	Jamie, you are unable to compete with me.
	Jozo thinks, “Although Dan dotes on you and loves you, as long as you do not know that and he does not tell you, you will never be together.”
	Jozo smiles for a while, and then looks down. Then, she reaches out her hands to touch Dan’s face.
	“Dan, if you like me, isn’t it better than loving her?” She whispers restlessly.
	Dan, who is in coma, can feel that someone is kissing him, and he thinks that it is Jamie. He wants to open his eyes, but he just becomes more and more unconscious...
	Jamie leaves the hospital; she doesn't even know what she is angry about.
	She even does not know that she would be so jealous when other women approach to Dan.
	Then her phone rings, and Jamie answers directly. She specks angrily, “Hello?”
	“Jamie? What’s wrong with you? Are you angry now?” It is Ryan. Jamie’s anger makes him feel surprised.
	
Chapter 191 Being Ruined
	In his memory, Jamie is seldom angry.
	She is always optimistic and happy, occasionally being cold to people, but she is seldom angry.
	When she knows that it is Ryan, she tries to control her anger and calm down.
	“I am fine. I just see two “pig” kissing...What’s the matter?”
	Only does Jamie compare Dan and Jozo to two pigs, then she feels comfortable.
	She is so magnanimous that she will let it go.
	Ryan knows that it is not so simple, but he does not continue to ask, “Do you forget that there are rehearsals? How can we start if you, the leading lady, is absent?”
	Then, it comes to her that she needs to deal with the product publicity of Moon Company. Now she is a little bit reluctant to do that.
	If she has not gone to pick up Ian so late yesterday, Ian would not have been kidnapped. If Ian was not kidnapped, Dan would not have been shot and injured, and he is still lying in the hospital.
	She sighs slowly and wants to refuse, but yesterday, she had signed her name on the contract. If she does not go, she will be in breach of contract.
	She cannot afford millions of liquidated damages. What’s more, Ryan does it good for her by choosing her to do the publicity. Thus, she cannot refuse.
	“OK. It takes me twenty minutes to get to the company.” Jamie rubs her brow with an imperceptible languor in her voice.
	Getting the anomaly in her tone, Ryan frowns and says, “Where are you now. I will pick you up now.”
	Jamie looks around and sees a sign above the green belt and tells him her location, “I am in the park near the central hospital.”
	She is not far from the hospital. Standing here, she can just see the window of the ward where Dan is in.
	It seems to be far, but it is also near.
	Ryan arrives at the park soon. And Jamie happens to go out and sees his car. Then Jamie goes there without hesitation.
	Jamie does not worry about Ian. Since he is a good boy, he will go back to the ward after he comes back from the toilet.
	When Ian is talking with Night.7, he sneezes and rubs his small nose. Does he catch a cold?
	“I have never seen you so sad. Do you break up with your boyfriend?” Ryan feels heartbroken that Jamie looks sad and has a faint black rim under her eyes. So he makes a joke.
	What’s wrong with her and Dan?
	“No, if I want a boyfriend, there's a bunch waiting for me, will I be lovelorn?” But the more she explains, the more embarrassed she becomes, and she forces herself to smile.
	Her smile to hide her sadness smile looks ugly.
	But she does not know that the way she hides herself makes Ryan feels that something must be wrong with her.
	But he does not plan to talk with Jamie about this topic directly. And this is the reason why Jamie likes to chat with him.
	Because Ryan is a gentle person with a good personality, even though he can see what really happens to you, he won't ask you directly.
	Because he knows that he will hurt someone if he asks those questions directly, and that the one who has forgotten those pains may be reminded again if being asked.
	Ryan pretends not to know and then mentions other topics. It will be better for Jamie to share with him indirectly.
	He is a good listener.
	“Yeah. I remember that you received lots of gifts in England. And you sold them to earn money because those gifts took up a lot of space.” Ryan says.
	Then he wondered that she was such a woman who did not admire money and sold those expensive gifts without hesitation because those gifts took up too much space.
	One of her craziest lovers is Katt.
	He is not only the boss of Jamie, but also likes Jamie. Every day, Katt would pick Jamie up to the company, and he asks someone to send gifts to her every few days.
	To be honest, Ryan is jealous of him.
	Because Katt can do whatever he wants, but Ryan can’t.
	But the only thing that makes Katt feel better is that Jamie will sell those things as long as they are not used. And then Jamie will use those money to buy delicious food for Ian without any hesitation.
	That proves that Jamie does not like Katt.
	However, what about Dan?
	Ryan looks serious gradually. Thinking of that cold and handsome man, he grips on the steering wheel tightly and gets lost in mind.
	“Ryan? The light turns green. What are you thinking about?” Jamie shouts at Ryan loudly.
	“Well? I'm sorry. I just remember something and forget that I am driving.” He smiles apologetically at her and then continues to drive.
	“What are you thinking about; you look so serious?” Jamie asks him casually, but subconsciously.
	“I just recall the life in England.” Ryan looks around and seems to miss something.
	If he could go back, he would do anything.
	Jamie seems to hear nothing. She just looks ahead. Cars of different colors pass them, and she feels unhappy.
	Jamie is one of those people who don't want to talk when she's unhappy, and would rather be alone for a while, and then she may feel a little better.
	But she still can't understand why she is unhappy.
	It seems like the Chinese cabbage that she has been raising for a long time has been hogged by a pig.
	Dan is the “Chinese cabbage”, and Jozo is the “pig”.
	In the hospital, Ian sits on the stairs with a notebook on his legs, with his meaty hands rapping on the keyboard, and his eyes glues to the progress bar on the screen.
	“Young master, we have already checked. The phone card that goes with the phone is made by personal order. If the phone is broken, the contents will be automatically removed and there will be no trace left.” Night.7 looks straight at Ian and tells him the truth.
	
Chapter 192 Nice to Meet You
	Night.7 thinks that Ian is so cute. If she isn’t doing a report, she will go to kiss him.
	It seems that Ian is born to be loved by women.
	“No.” Ian looks at the English words on the screen and bites his lips. No matter how he checks it, the phone's card is blank, and nothing could be found, not even the call records.
	Who the hell wants to kidnap him?
	If they are only for him, Ian can play with them, but this time, they hurt his father, so Ian will not forgive them. He promises to find them out.
	“Night.7, do you find out who wants to kidnap me?” Ian turns off the computer and asks.
	Night.7 shrugs her shoulders and gives a negative answer, “They seem to have expected that we would search, so the clues have been deleted, and...” She pauses, with a certain severity on her face, “When I want to have a further search, those people can hide me every time. Isn’t it a coincidence?”
	It seems that they know what Nigh.7 and Ian will do in the next step.
	“You mean there’s a mole?” Ian props up his chin, squints, and says.
	“I don't doubt them. We've trained together since we were kids. They can't be spies.” Night.7 firmly shakes her head. It seems that she completely trusts other four people.
	Ian smiles, “I don’t want to doubt them, either.”
	Both of them keep silent. Then, suddenly, looking at Night.7, Ian asks, “Night.7, are you sure that there are only five people left in the 18-people group?”
	Night.7 does not understand why Ian would ask such a question, but she still truthfully answers, “Yeah. We saw that other five people died.”
	The fire burned everything in the Gilbert’s house, including those five people. In the end, they run away from the fire luckily at the cost of serious injure.
	The fire is always their shadow and nightmare.
	Ian nods and talks with Night.7 several words. And then he gives the computer back to her, and walks to the ward.
	Night.7 stares at the computer for a few seconds, thinking about what Ian just said.
	Night.7 decides to investigate the details.
	After Night.7 leaves, a figure came out slowly from behind the door of the empty stairwell. The man stares at the place where Ian and Night.7 has been sitting.
	Then, he disappears behind the door.
	Ian puts his hands in his pockets coolly. Today, he wears a pair of jeans with a small shirt with a cute pattern. He looks handsome and naughty, and those nurses stare at him.
	Standing at the door of the ward, Ian pushes the door. He does not see Jamie but only sees Jozo sitting near the bed.
	Who is she?
	Ian frowns, takes a deep breath and enters into the ward, smiling.
	Jozo looks up and sees Ian coming in. Though she has seen the photos of Ian in the survey data, she is still very surprised at the first sight of Ian.
	Everyone who knows Dan will feel surprised if he sees Ian.
	They look like each other.
	Jozo blinks her eyes, trying to hide the hatred in her eyes.
	But the hatred has been seen by Ian clearly.
	“Hello.” Jozo smiles at Ian softly. Her voice is so sweet that it seems that she is afraid of scaring Ian.
	Even if she hates Ian, Ian is Dan’s son. Thus, if she hopes to be accepted by Dan, she has to get along well with Ian.
	Ian’s psychology is taught by Night.7. As an invisible and unemotional killer in a five-person organization, Night.7’s psychology has become so skilled that it can control someone's mind and kill him.
	Under the guidance of such a master, Ian must be great. Otherwise, he would not be able to control that man’s thought and kill him when he was fighting against the man in black.
	In retrospect, Ian’s little heart is still beating. It is very exciting
	So when Ian sees Jozo for the first time, he knows that the woman does not like him and that she has to pretend to like him and to talk with him softly.
	Ian squints, smiling. She looks around the ward, but fails to find Jamie.
	Wasn’t Mom pissed off by this bad woman? How can she let these monsters get together with daddy?
	“Nice to meet you.” Ian smiles and calls Jozo as “aunt”.
	Her smile gradually disappears and she turns to be angry, looking at Ian.
	She thinks that Ian is as bad as Jamie.
	“What’s your name?” Jozo takes a deep breath and asks.
	“My name is Ian Moore. Why are you in my father’s ward?”
	Ian answers politely, trying to be polite, though he dislikes Jozo’s sight.
	……
	When Jamie and Ryan arrive at the filming location, those props have been prepared. The first location is at Great Sea Park.
	The entire Great Sea Park, including the activity areas around the park, has been rented by the Moon Company, and visitors are not allowed to enter.
	The aim is also to maintain a sense of mystery for the product exhibition.
	Jamie is absent-minded. And she seems to be absent-minded when the director of planning tells her notes.
	“Are you okay, Miss Moore? Would you like to take a break?” The planning director is a very handsome man, and he seems to have a good impression of Jamie.
	In A city, there are lots of beautiful actress, they are all beautiful and have sexy bodies.
	But even without makeup, Jamie is exactly the same as those who wear heavy makeup. She has a natural, clear and clean temperament, which is pleasing.
	Jamie’s frowning eyebrows loosen, and she smiles at the planning director politely and says clearly, “It does not matter. Don’t stop filming because of me.”
	The planning director seems to like her much better.
	“Well, if you have any question, just let me know.”
	“All right.” Jamie nods. Then the director goes to see whether Ryan’s clothes are ready or not.
	
Chapter 193 Filming
	Everybody here is very busy, including Ryan. Then Jamie picks up the clothes on the table and goes to the dressing room.
	The contents of the filming are very simple, which should all be expressed with the eyes. As a couple, the eyes of the leading actor and actress must be affectionate and intimate when they are looking at each other.
	There are three bottles of perfume, and they need to be photographed in three different locations three times.
	The first bottle is mint green perfume.
	Jamie and Ryan are standing in the park. They shall look at each other far away and then slowly approach. At this time, Ryan will take out a bottle of perfume with deep eyes, which carry some helplessness and pain.
	The aim is to express that the young does not cherish the love when being young, and that they fail to be together when they turn to be old.
	Admittedly, the designers of the perfume are very creative.
	But Jamie does not know what the feeling of “loving but can’t owe” is.
	Jamie wears a mint green chiffon dress with a tight waist and an elegant bow at the back. She also wears low-heeled white shoes that make her calves look paler and longer.
	The outfit adds to Jamie’s playful image as a carefree college freshman.
	It seems that she is at the age of eighteen.
	Ryan wears a white shirt and black casual pants, and the white shirt only buckles the second button. His legs are slender and straight, which are different from Dan’s strong and powerful legs.
	His trousers are folded up to reveal a fair ankle, and he wears a pair of British leather shoes, exactly like a schoolboy.
	He approaches Jamie slowly, gently and softly at every step and his eyes looks sad and affectionate.
	The scene is beautiful, with the color of slight mint green everywhere, but there is no perfume in the air.
	Because inside and outside, it is thoroughly sanitized, and there is no perfume left.
	To make them feel something, the crew gets some clever ideas with the scene.
	The floor under their feet is a special luminous floor made by the staff.
	“Jamie, your eyes should look hesitated and reluctant. Imagine that Jack is the one that you love but can get together with him...” The director says, looking at Jamie’s slightly stiff face on the screen.
	Hesitation? Reluctance?
	Jamie’s eyes are blank.
	“Stop! This one does not work. The scene and emotions need to be expressed through eyes.” The director shouts. And Jamie, who has nearly walked the middle, is forced to stop.
	She listens to the director and takes notes carefully.
	She is a person of principle, since she has chosen to do the job, she must do her best.
	“Well, carry on from there!”
	Everyone stares at Jamie and Ryan on the glow-in-the-dark floor.
	The scene is very beautiful. The only lights shine on them, and the floor under their feet is like a flowing Milky Way.
	What is more striking is that Jamie’s skirt is also fluorescent, and Ryan’s white shirt is inlaid with a ring of fluorescent thread. Under the light, they look particularly beautiful.
	The staff carefully moves the light to the two people. In addition to the faint fluorescence on their bodies, the most eye-catching thing is the perfume bottle that Ryan is holding in his hand.
	It seems that the filming will be finished successfully.
	However, Jamie’s deep eyes suddenly look tired and her shoulders are drooping.
	“Stop! What happen?” Because Jamie is a designer of CR Group, the director does not want to say anything. He just asks patiently.
	“Director, let her take a rest. Jamie does not look well.” Ryan talks with the director, and he worries about Jamie.
	But she does not know that her absent-minded look makes Ryan sad.
	“Well, let’s take a rest for twenty minutes.” Then, the director goes to ask those people to rearrange the scene.
	“Ryan, I want to go to the toilet, I am so sorry.” Jamie looks at Ryan. She thinks that she would not come here if she has known that she is in such a bad mood.
	But she does not know that she is in such a bad state that she could be absent-minded during the filming.
	She seems to be affected by the scene when Jozo kisses Dan.
	“Go ahead.” Ryan wants to touch her hair. But he thinks of that Dan also touched her hair that day. Then he withdraws his hand.
	Jamie takes her bag and goes to the toilet.
	When she goes to the toilet, she finally realizes why she is in such a bad mood.
	She almost forgets her monthly menstrual cycle,
	Fortunately, since last time, Jamie has formed the habit of putting sanitary napkins in her bag, so she has avoided the embarrassment of asking someone else to borrow them.
	In the toilet, she puts a piece of sanitary napkin on her underwear, which makes her even more uncomfortable.
	No girl would like that.
	Even Wendy, who has been a tough woman, curses her menstrual period every day and says that it had better not come for a lifetime. And Jamie laughs at her that she cannot get a baby if not having her menstrual period.
	Jamie is wearing a skirt, so it is convenient for her. And luckily, the underwear does not leave a lot of blood.
	“Well, do you know who Jamie is?
	When Jamie is about to go out, she hears her name being mentioned. Thus, she does not want to go out and sits on the toilet seat to listen carefully.
	It is said that the toilet is the best place to gossip.
	Men, women and children all like to come to the toilet to talk about life and the world.
	And such things happen to Jamie a few times.
	And she likes to do it.
	“Is she a designer of CR Group? It is said that her works is superb. And almost all the rich ladies know Jamie?” A woman says. Her voice sounds envious.
	“I also know her. She is injured in the last CR Group nomination meeting, and she is sent to the hospital by Dan, the president of the CR Group. They must have a special relationship.”
	“We all know the relationship between a boss and a subordinate.”
	“Well, why does she come to film the publicity video? With the help of Mr. William, it is easy for her to film a movie.”
	“We do not know how she hooks up with the most famous bachelor in A city. She is so lucky that she can hook up Dan by designing several clothes.”
	
Chapter 194 Apologize to Me
	"Yes, maybe she is just skillful in bed. If she serves well, naturally she doesn’t need to worry about anything."
	"Yes, it may be right. Maybe Dan likes this kind of woman who seems self-contained. I can do that too."
	"Maybe she has betrayed herself for getting this filming. Hah hah..."
	The volume of these girls’ discussion is getting louder and louder, and they don’t worry about being heard by others.
	The protagonist they are discussing is in the toilet cubicle.
	Jamie listens to the malicious words from outside the door and squeezes her fingers.
	Everything she owns today is not from Dan. She is relying on herself. All these are earned by herself step by step. She has gone through numerous hardships before success.
	She does not expect that there are so many people who talk about her in this way although she is not a star or a public figure.
	Does she feel wronged?
	She used to stay up all night for three days and nights for FS's generous salary, just to shock those interviewers who look down on people. She locks herself in the room and almost gets prostration when she comes out.
	When she hands the design draft over and is about to succeed in the final process, she is targeted by an unscrupulous interviewer. She beats the interviewer to the ground to protect herself.
	At the same time, she loses her opportunity.
	Her palms were once very tender. But after she arrives in England, she keeps holding the brush and drawing all day long to make a living. The fingers holding the pen are covered with a layer of callus, which is not easy to be noticed if you don’t touch it carefully.
	She is a spoiled girl. What can she do? She can only do what she is good at, that is, painting.
	She has experienced the most difficult day. When she was still pregnant with Ian, she did not go out to paint because of the heavy rain which continued for a few days. Therefore, she had no income for a few days.
	After a few days by eating only bread and cream, she was so hungry. But fortunately, Ian was very strong in her and he never bothered her at all.
	That was the only motivation Jamie could hold on.
	After that, she went to FS with her only hope.
	She was spoiled by Dan. She was used to keeping her self-esteem and she was also used to being proud. She couldn’t beg a company that rejects her.
	But that time, she really bowed her head and abandoned all her self-esteem and pride. She stepped into FS again under the unkind eyes of the employees.
	It was Katt who admits her.
	Katt is different from those who are interested in her, but he is the only one who affirms her works.
	With his protection, Jamie seems to work smoothly in FS. But how can she win those treacherous guys without any experiences?
	It is said that there must be an important transformation in life. That transformation will affect you in lifetime. Jamie thinks that she probably begins to transform from that time.
	She transforms from a silly girl, who can’t take care of her own life, into a real Jamie.
	How can she be defeated? There is no one she can rely on behind.
	She loves every piece of her works, and she treats them as her own life.
	Therefore, she will never allow anyone to defame her works in this way.
	The voices outside are still going on. Jamie stands up and opens the door to go out.
	Those people don't expect that she is inside. Thus they widen their mouths in surprise, and subconsciously move back to make room for her.
	Jamie walks slowly to the washstand and put her small hands under the faucet to wash slowly.
	She looks up and sees the face of the girl who speaks most loudly just now. She also looks at the others again and smiles with her eyes full of contempt and arrogance.
	She doesn’t fight, but her dignity exposes. She looks like a queen who is looking down on her subjects.
	A few of the girls wants to run away under her sights but they can’t move under her gaze.
	"You just had a good talking" Jamie shakes her hands and takes a tissue from the side. Then she wipes her hand slowly.
	She has a pair of white and tender hands.
	"No, no. Miss Moore, you mishear it..." Jamie finds that she is the girl who had just said that she betrayed herself to Dan although she can paint.
	She smiles and turns around, and then walks towards the girl and stares at her.
	The words coming out from the beautiful and small lips are full of irony.
	"As you said, if you can paint, you can go on others’ bed. Lady, you seem to have a lot of experience in this issue. Why don’t you share with us?"
	The girl's face becomes pale. She stares at Jamie and doesn’t dare to retort although she is angry.
	Jamie really has her identity that she is a designer of CR. She is also named at the nomination meeting. The clothes she designs are still the targets of all women.
	She believes that as long as she says that she is Jamie, no woman will dare to disrespect her.
	More importantly, she also has a strong relationship with the CR president. In case she really irritates her, she will offend the CR president.
	However, she does offend Jamie but not because of Dan.
	"Miss Moore, we don’t do it on purpose. So don't affect the filming for this trivial matter." One girl sees her partner suffering embarrassment so she places her blame on Jamie as if she has done something sinister.
	Not on purpose?
	Jamie chuckles and glances at the faces of them, "Well? So, it's not deliberate that you slanders me and insults me behind my back."
	"We just said a few words about you. You don’t suffer anything, don’t you? Can you deny that what we said is true?" The girl can’t help raising her voice and retorts loudly.
	"Just a few words?" Jamie turns indifferently and looks directly at the girl, "Well, I will give you a chance to vent you anger now. How is it?"
	"What?"
	The girls don’t understand the meaning of her words and look at her with confusion.
	In front of the toilet, there is a lawn, which is very close to the filming location. But it is shadowed by trees.
	Jamie stands opposite to the girl just now. She raises her brows with her eyes looking cold. Moreover, her lips show a smile confidently.
	"I will give you a chance now. Let’s have a competition. If you win, I will quit the filming. If I win, you must apologize to me in front of everyone and apologize to my paintings!"
	She speaks clearly, gently and powerfully, with an inviolable and noble look on her small face.
	"How do we have the competition?" The girl responds without fears.
	"Don't you say that I only own my business today by betraying myself? Then let's compete on making clothes." Jamie says with her arms around her chest.
	
Chapter 195 The Competition
	Making clothes?
	The other girls look at her in disbelief. How can they make clothes if there are no cloths?
	"Are you kidding ..." The girl flinches a little. Making clothes? She is not Jamie. How can she do that?
	"Or, you can join together. As long as you can take pieces of cloths from me, you will all win."
	What Jamie speaks amazes them.
	These girls suddenly understand.
	What she means is that they shall use the fabric on each other's clothes to make a new dress based on the original one.
	It is so ridiculous, isn’t it?
	"The time is limited within half an hour. Let's get started." Jamie's mouth twitches, and her index finger touches them slightly. "Do you want me to tell the director that you just slandered me? Or do you want to compete with me?"
	The salary of Moon is high, and of course these girls cannot give up.
	Within such a short time, even if Jamie is skillful, it is impossible for her have such ability to make a dress for them and wear it on them!
	She just wants to scare them. They aren’t afraid of her.
	Thinking about it, a few girls discusses about it. For fairness, they let a girl who has studied costume design to compete with Jamie.
	"So, it's time to start." Jamie's eyes lift slightly, and her petite and soft body quickly reaches the two girls. She stretches her hand out to tear the girl's cloth, and the girl's dress is split into several pieces from the waist.
	"Ah!" The girl doesn't expect that Jamie would be so vigorous. And before she can react, she sees Jamie's fingers twitching and moving like butterflies while tearing a few pieces from her clothes.
	The girls watching from the side are also stunned. They even don’t know that someone is approaching.
	Jamie’s delicate and elegant face looks calm and peaceful. And from time to time she takes out the pearl clips added by the stylist in her hair and clips them on the girls’ clothes. Moreover, she even adorns the dress with accessories on her hands.
	Her fingers moves fast, but she is not in a hurry at all, as if she has practiced it for thousands times.
	Her movements are beautiful, like a dancing elf, which makes others unable to divert their attention.
	Time is almost up. Jamie narrows her eyes slightly and takes a hairpin out of her hair to fix it. Then she straightens her waist and moves back.
	Everyone seems to hold their breath because the newly-made dress on the girl makes them fail to turn their eyes away.
	When Jamie and the girl are competing, a lot of people gather here.
	Everyone is stunned. They can’t imagine that Jamie actually makes a new dress in less than half an hour!
	CR's new designers really cannot be underestimated.
	Ryan stands in the front of these people and looks at Jamie, who has a radiant confidence on her face, with deep love in his eyes.
	The girl is so shocked that she can’t recover for a long time.
	She is wearing a conservative goose yellow dress before, but now it is transformed into an irregular separated dress by Jamie.
	The upper cloth is directly torn into a shirt by Jamie, and the hem of the shirt is beveled. Because time is limited, Jamie directly pulls the line from the inside, so it seems to have more folds which are sticking to the waist and exposing a small part of the waist. It outlines the girl’s slender waist.
	Even the sleeves are torn directly to the sleeveless one and the fabrics originally on the sleeves are fixed with a pearl clip and are folded into a collar. The original regular dress becomes an irregular top.
	What's more amazing is that if Jamie tears off the upper cloth, then the lower part of the dress will fall. But Jamie uses the fabric ripped from the original dress and makes her a belt.
	The hemline of the dress is also inevitably torn. But Jamie just adds the arc of it. Thus, it looks light and at the same time it does not make people feel rigid.
	There is no waste of any amount of fabric. She only modifies and adds some decorations based on the original dress.
	Jamie glances around to catch the reactions of the onlookers, and raises the corners of her mouth. There is a cheerful smile.
	What really makes her proud is not how amazing this dress is, but is the fact that she wins the dignity and reputation for herself.
	"Are you convinced?" Jamie walks to girl with a faint look and asks in a light tone. But she has arrogance that cannot be ignored.
	The girl immediately recovers, and the onlookers around her also gradually recover from the surprise. They don’t know who begins first, suddenly the people present bursts into thunderous applause.
	The girls standing in the inner circle lower their heads in shame and embarrassment. What they said just now seems to slap back on their faces and makes them embarrassed.
	Jamie doesn't beat them, but she just tells them with her strength that she can’t be slandered by anyone easily.
	If someone wants to defame her, he’d better think about the consequences.
	She’s much more independent than the past Jamie, who would say something embarrassing with a sharp tongue to others when she creates some troubles or when someone irritates her. At that time, she was a little girl who was backed up by Dan.
	"Do you still remember our bet? Since that you lose, you can fulfill your promise."
	As soon as her words come out, the onlookers guess what kind of the bet it is.
	Ryan's eyes flickers. He looks at Jamie, who is not far away, feeling a bit complicated.
	Jamie is not the kind of people who would argue with the staff for a trivial matter. She does this because someone offends her taboo.
	She is so dare to love and hate, and she never cares anything that she doesn't care. She will desperately protect what she does care.
	The several girls stand in a row unwillingly. They lower their heads and bows. They bite the bullet and say, "I'm sorry. We shouldn't vilify you secretly!"
	Well!
	It turns out to be this reason!
	Everyone immediately understands that it is because these few girls make things hard for Jamie that this competition finally happens.
	"You can go to the personnel department to settle your salary later and you aren’t allowed to come tomorrow." Ryan walks to Jamie's side. He looks at the girls coldly and orders.
	The girls’ faces turn pale and look up at Ryan in panic.
	"Ryan, I'm just competing with them. Why do you fire them? Is the Moon so traditional that it isn’t allowed employees to compete in private?" Jamie pulls his sleeve and smiles indifferently.
	If these girls lose their jobs because of her, then she is totally wrong.
	Ryan knows what she means. And he knows that Jamie understands why he wants to fire them.
	With a sigh in his heart, he says, "You should thank Miss Moore. In the future, don't forget that you are employees of Moon and your behavior represents the entire company. In the future, I don't want this kind of thing to happen for the second time.
	"Yes, Mr. Jack." the girls respond and then leave with their heads down. And the others on the scene also disperse.
Chapter 196 So Why does He Allow Jozo to Kiss Him?
	Ryan's words are not only spoken to those girls but also to everyone.
	In this way, no one will dare to defame Jamie as before, even behind Jamie.
	But what convinces everyone more is Jamie's own ability.
	"Let's go. Isn't the filming about to start?" Jamie smiles at Ryan. Her eyebrows and eyes are beautiful and her smile is bright. She is delighted and very comfortable.
	"Okay, let's go." Ryan doesn't ask her about what happens and returns to the spot with her.
	...
	This filming ends very early. It won't be ended so fast, but it takes a relatively short time because only a part of it is filmed.
	Ryan takes Jamie downstairs quietly to the hospital and drives away.
	It has to say that he is very smart and never asks anything. He will only accompany her.
	Jamie walks to the door of the ward and struggles for a long time before she regains her courage to enter.
	Jozo is still inside, glaring at Ian.
	Dan is already awake and leans against the wall, rubbing his eyebrows. His just-awaking look is lazy and casual, exuding a fatal temptation. The slightly messy black hair makes him look wild and sexy.
	There is no expression on that handsome face. Only when he sees Ian, his bright black eyes would become tender.
	Hearing the movement, Dan slowly turns his head and sees Jamie standing stiffly at the door. Frowning at her, he says in a deep voice, "Why are you standing there? Come here."
	"Oh." Jamie glances at him and responds with her soft voice. She moves to the bed, facing Jozo's slightly hostile gaze. She walks to the position Ian makes for her and sits down.
	"Miss Moore, I haven't seen you for a long time." Jozo smiles softly, looking like a white lily which is gentle and soft.
	If Jamie doesn’t know her nature, she might have been deceived.
	"Yes." Jamie answers quietly, and stops looking at her.
	"Where did you go?" Dan looks up at her with his cold, mysterious and serious eyes.
	"I went to take Moon's promotional video." Jamie replies honestly. In fact, there is a hint of idea to irritate Dan in her heart.
	So why does he allow Jozo to kiss him?
	If Dan knows her thoughts, she’s afraid he will grab her for a fight. Because he thinks that it is Jamie who kisses him.
	Dan's face quickly turns bad and he watches at Jamie with danger lingering in his eyes.
	Damn. He is lying here while she goes to take Moon's promotional video for Ryan without a burden?
	It's really great.
	"Miss Moore is really versatile. You have a good talent in design, and you can show up on the screen like a star, which helps Dan so much. I am not as helpful as you are." At the end, Jozo signs softly while putting her finger on the legs.
	How will Jamie miss her little trick? She can understand that her words are actually attacking her by innuendo. Jozo refers that she shouldn’t show up in the public while she is a good designer. And the last sentence she says really reverses the identity of the host and guest.
	Then she becomes the hostess, and Jamie is the superfluous one.
	"Daddy, I want to ask you a serious question." Ian, who hasn't spoken for a while, suddenly looks at Dan and says seriously.
	"Yes." Dan nods and looks at him.
	"Is this aunt a daddy's relative?"
	"No."
	"Does this aunt have a special relationship with Daddy?"
	"No."
	"Then why does this aunt stay at here all the time? She has been here for almost a day."
	With Ian's questioning, Jozo's face gradually turns bad.
	Bad guy. His words are so sharp. He clearly wants Dan to drive her away.
	Dan stares at Jozo. The coldness in his eyes is obvious. He knows that Jozo has been here since he has awakened. But when he sees that she has been chatting with Ian, she doesn't let her go.
	But now ...
	"Jozo, go back." The sentence is short, which is in line with Dan's silent character.
	Jozo feels unhappy. She puts her leg in front of Dan and says softly, "Dan, I have taken care of you when you are injured. I have experience and it will be more convenient if I am here."
	Jamie can’t help chuckling. And she sighs that she has no idea about whether Jozo is smart or not.
	Jozo knows how to make use of the previous affection. But she doesn’t know if Dan will fall for this.
	Ian purses his small mouth. He doesn't show his dissatisfaction although he is unhappy. What Jozo says is clearly embarrassing them. If Daddy really let her stay, he will run away with mommy secretly!
	Dan has so many bad pursuers that they really reduce his charms!
	"I don't want to say it the second time." Dan's expression is so indifferent that it overflows a precious beauty.
	Things he decides rarely change, and obviously, Jozo is not the exception.
	Dan is not stupid. The existence of Jozo has made Jamie and Ian have a different attitude towards him. If this continues, it will be bad for everyone.
	As Jozo saved him at the cost of her legs before, Dan doesn't let Derek drive her away. He is completely benevolent enough.
	Jamie sees that Jozo is pushed out of the ward by Alma. And Jozo even gives her a provocative glance before leaving.
	She doesn't understand why this woman is so proud at her at this time?
	Moreover, she seldom sees that Dan would tolerate a person so much, and rarely sees other women approaching him.
	But Jozo is an exception. He allows her approach and has been talking to her patiently and tenderly with a look that Jamie has never seen.
	Never seen? No, it seems has. She has seen it elsewhere.
	That's right, Jamie feels unhappy. It is still because Dan's attitude towards Jozo.
	She might have a fever to think so.
	Quickly go away! Jamie tries to drives the idea away from her mind. But her mind becomes even more chaotic. It is just like a box of flour that is poured with water, which is all mixed together.
	There is no way to think about it well.
	Ian feels delighted in his heart and adds another point to Dan. Looking at the two who have been silent for a while, he begins to roll his eyes.
	"Mommy, it’s time to bed. Go brush your teeth and wash your face. Then we can sleep together." Ian pulls Jamie's clothes, and his smile is harmless.
	Jamie doesn't understand what Ian says, thinking he is urging her to go to bed quickly. So she rubs his little head and goes to the bathroom.
	When Ian sees Jamie entering the bathroom, he takes off his shoes and crawls to Dan's side. Fortunately, the bed is big enough for four people to sleep.
	"Daddy, I tell you ..." Ian approaches Dan's ear, and they whispers happily.
	Jamie comes out and sees Ian lying next to Dan. His two little fleshy hands grab the quilt and only a small head exposes. There is a cute smile on his face.
Chapter 197 Bunny Wants to Sleep with Daddy and Mummy
	Dan, who lies next to Ian, is reading a book. His beautiful fingers are holding the book. When he turns the page, it makes a pleasant rustling sound.
	With this look, the indifference, which shows up when he works with a pen and makes decisions, disappears. His entire body is filled with a gentle and warm atmosphere. Jamie can’t help but glancing at him for several times.
	Jamie twitches her lips and looks at Ian. She asks, "Bunny, are you going to sleep with your father tonight?"
	Ian looks at Jamie with his big eyes. He snatches the covers off, and beckons Jamie, "Mommy, come here quickly. Bunny wants to sleep with mommy and daddy."
	What? Sleep with mommy and daddy?
	Jamie's mouth twitches more severely.
	Can’t the boy feel her and Dan's attitude? Who actually indulge him to have this bad habit of holding her and Dan to sleep?
	In fact, Jamie is ashamed to be on the same bed with Dan.
	"Mommy can sleep alone." Jamie walks to the sofa and sits down, nesting on it.
	Fortunately, the sofa is soft enough, and it will be fine if she sleeps here.
	However, Ian glances at Jamie with disgust, and says, "Mommy, aren't you afraid that you will do something to dad in midnight because of your wild nature in sleep with mommy and daddy?”
	"Who tell you I will?"
	Bad boy. You have already stood by his side in such a few days!
	"Why doesn't mommy dare to come here? Dad won't do anything to mommy anyway." Then he stabs Dan's arm.
	Dan's faint gaze wanders around Jamie and then he nods.
	It seems that he is mocking Jamie with his eyes in that she doesn't have any charming figure!
	Jamie's anger increases finally. She throws away the pillow in her hand, striding to the bed and moving in to pull the quilt.
	"Don’t you have eyes? Are you blind?" she is still showing off her proud chest and sneers at him while turning her head away.
	Self-esteem! Self-esteem! Her self-esteem!
	He actually thinks that she doesn’t have a charming figure. Anyway, they are separated by Ian. She isn’t afraid that he can do anything to her.
	She dares to kick him down if he dares to touch her.
	Ian and Dan glance at each other and blink tacitly. Then they turn off the lights and fall asleep.
	Jamie turns her back to them. Although Ian is between them, the diffuse from Dan's body can still be smelt. She covers her face in the quilt. There is all his unique fragrance in the whole quilt.
	It's very fragrant, as if it can hypnotize her. Jamie's eyelids are getting heavier and heavier and her consciousness is gradually becoming unclear.
	In the confusion, she seems to feel a hand protruding toward her hand. The hand is dry and warm, giving an endless sense of security.
	Dan still has injuries behind his back, so he can’t move too heavily. He hasn’t done anything yet. Jamie, who is few distances away from him and has restless sleep, rolls into his arms somehow.
	His sexy throat rolls up and down. And then he holds his lips tightly and reaches out to embrace Jamie's slender shoulders with his black eyes narrow comfortably.
	…
	In the early morning.
	This night, Jamie sleeps well and even forgets that she is holding on to the other side. When she opens her eyes, her heart almost collapses.
	She remembers that she is sleeping well on the other side. When does she get into Dan's arms?
	Jamie glares at Dan who is still asleep. She is held in his arms. A pair of powerful arms tightly hugs her slender shoulders. From her position, she can see his jaws with beautiful lines when she looks up at him.
	Jamie reaches out her fingers and gently squeezes a few times on that face. She is anxious when she squeezes, fearing that Dan will suddenly wake up.
	His face is a little bit cold, and there is hardness like a rhombus. It is uncomfortable when she squeezes but the touch makes her feel good.
	Why does he have such perfect skin?
	Jamie grunts in her heart, but she doesn’t stop.
	At this moment, a big hand suddenly grabs her thin white wrist. Her heartbeat suddenly misses a beat. He looks straightly at her, which leaves her nowhere to escape.
	She doesn’t know when Dan is awake. His big hands clasp her little hands. And his long, narrow black eyes are deep and bright, as if it is filled with the stars.
	He hooks his lips, looking at Jamie's helpless face and asking deliberately, "What are you doing just now?"
	Oops!
	There is an embarrassment on Jamie's face, because she has done something guilty just now, she becomes timid and at him
	Oh my god! Why does he wake up at this time?
	"I did nothing. I see something on your face. I can clean it for you." Jamie smiles embarrassingly and intends to clean something from his face by patting it. But under the sight of his narrow eyes, she can’t finish it at all.
	He raises his eyebrows and doesn't let go of her hand. Instead, he leans forward in front of her. His voice is low and magnetic, "Jamie, why did you stare at me just now?"
	It is a rhetorical question.
	In an unsure tone.
	Dan doesn’t know if he has blurred vision. In Jamie's eyes, it does have some hints that she is a little bit moved.
	It’s very small and very subtle. Dan is glad that he wakes up suddenly. Otherwise he will miss it.
	Does this mean that she has already begun to like him and let go of the man in her heart?
	Jamie's face turns red. She unconsciously dodges his sights when he stares at her. Her eyes even have tears, and her white teeth clench her lower lip tightly. She is disturbed for a few seconds.
	She doesn't know that her subconscious little movements intangibly confirm Dan's thoughts.
	Dan has a secret but he won't tell Jamie.
	This secret is not about his love for Jamie. He loves Jamie, which is no longer a secret.
	No one knows this secret, but Dan knows it all.
	That is, Jamie bites her lower lip subconsciously when she is seen through or is nervous.
	Dan remembers this little action for a long time. For many times, Jamie's little action is more real than anything she says.
	It seems to be true.
	Dan's lips raises and his eyebrows turn gentle. It is full of affectionate feelings and a little excitement of joy.
	"How can I help you get rid of the dirt on your face if I don’t look at you?" Jamie replies while she pretends to be calm. But the sound of her heart beats constantly has already betrayed her.
	"Well." Dan chuckles a few times. She can’t hear any indifferent feelings in his laughter and he seems very happy. "Jamie, are you afraid of being found out? You're so anxious to explain?"
	Unexpectedly, Jamie jumps up from the bed. But before she is able to jump down, Dan presses her into his arms.
	She looks at him angrily. But when she comes into contact with his cold eyes, she dares not to look at it directly.
	She feels butterflies in the stomach and now she really wants to slap herself to be in a coma.
	"Dan, let me go!" Jamie shouts angrily, but she can’t get rid of his strong and muscular arms.
	
Chapter 198 Why Do You Lie on My Brother's Bed?
	She is a little flustered and is afraid that something will be discovered by him. She wants to be free but her brain is blank.
	No. Why should she be so scared? She has been hugged by him before. Why does her heart beat so fast this time?
	It’s terrible!
	Dan sees all her expressions, and slowly lifts her small chin, forcing her to look at him. His eyes seem to have with endless emotions, which cover Jamie like a net and make him fail to escape away.
	"Tell me, what are you afraid of?"
	His voice is low but is attractive. His tone seems to be a little gentle as if it has a bewitching function.
	Under the gaze of his eyes, Jamie can’t move at all.
	What is she afraid of?
	The answer is about to come out. Jamie opens her lips and she is about to say her own answer.
	At this moment, the door of the ward suddenly opens and Amelia walks in. She sees Dan and Jamie on the bed and is frozen for a moment.
	Then she points at Jamie with an unbelievable expression. She glares at her unacceptably, "You, why are you lying on my brother's bed? What were you doing just now? Why are you so shameless?"
	Her attitude seems to shoot Jamie through by her beautiful eyes. And the scornful look of accusation shows the meaning that Jamie has done something evil.
	Jamie is a little speechless. When Amelia just interrupts her words, she forgets what she is about to say. She raises her eyebrows and is annoyed.
	Dan's expression is not much better than her. Originally Jamie's answer is ready to come out and it is almost in the next second. The girl who is arrogant will admit it but Amelia comes here at this time...
	It has to say that Amelia just jump on the gun this time.
	"Amelia." He yells in a low voice with narrow eyes flashing sharply, which make Amelia wince.
	What she is most afraid of is Dan's serious look although he looks peaceful. Countless cold pressures presses down on her, and she dares not refute it.
	But the indulgence in her bones prevents her from letting Jamie go so easily.
	In addition, Dan is obviously biased towards Jamie, which annoys Amelia.
	She walks to the other side of the bed and grabs Jamie's thin arm to pull her down the bed with force.
	Jamie doesn't expect Amelia to do this suddenly. Fortunately, her reaction is timely and her feet lands steadily to avoid the embarrassment of falling to the ground.
	"Go out, you such a bitch. Who let you come in? Get out!" Amelia tugs Jamie and pushes her out of the ward unceremoniously with unimaginable force.
	Jamie is barefoot on the ground. Although the weather is not cold, she still feels cold and it hurts.
	"Amelia, have you done?" Dan straightens up. His face looks pale and the wounds on his back and shoulders are still faintly painful. He endures the pain of broken bones and his eyes are sharp and warning while he looks at Amelia.
	"Dan!" Amelia is dissatisfied and stomps to rebut.
	Dan doesn't give her this opportunity, and coldly opens his mouth, "If you are enough, go back. Don't behave badly here!"
	Amelia's face is bad. She doesn't expect Dan to be so strict with her. Although he used to be serious with her occasionally, he never shouts at her so severely.
	Behave badly?
	Does she behave badly?
	Then she will behave badly today!
	Amelia's force on Jamie’s arm is stronger. Even Jamie, who is good at bearing the pain, can’t help frowning her eyebrows.
	Amelia may intend to take a piece of fresh from her and it really hurts her!
	"Amelia, put down your hands!" Jamie steps on the cold floor and her white feet shrink a little. She feels Amelia's force to increase a little and she is annoying.
	Her other arm is caught by Dan, preventing Amelia from pushing her out.
	"I won't let go! How can you attack me?" She almost forgets Dan is grabbing Jamie. Amelia seems to be cruel that she has to pull Jamie out.
	Suddenly, Amelia uses a hard force. Dan’s hand, which holds Jamie's wrist, is driven by her. The wounds on the shoulders and back make a slight tearing sound, followed by Dan's gasp.
	Jamie looks back and sees Dan's suddenly pale face. And his lips are blue. Won’t he hurt the wound?
	"Dan!" Jamie doesn't care if she will hurt Amelia anymore. She flips her wrist and struggles away from Amelia's hand. When she is free, her wrist turns a little red.
	Amelia's face is pale and she is trembling. She helplessly watches the doctors coming inside in a daze. She doesn’t expect that her naughty behavior will cause Dan's wound to be tore again. He is now sent to the operating room.
	"Amelia, how stupid you are? Your brother is sent to the operating room again. Are you happy?" Jamie leans against the wall and her eyes are swiftly sweeping across Amelia's face.
	Dan's injury is serious because no one can survive and be safe after being hit by two bullets at the same time.
	Although it doesn’t hurt the vital part, Dan hurts his right shoulder and he can’t use his right hand to hold things for a short time.
	Jamie knows all these, but she doesn't expect that Amelia can cause his wounds being torn as soon as she shows up. If she hasn't grown up with Amelia since childhood, she would doubt whether Amelia is Dan's sister because Amelia just has nice breast shape but has no brain!
	But ... can it really hurt Dan with such a little force?
	Amelia purses her lips and she rarely refutes her. She knows she is responsible for the mistake this time, and she is very guilty. But her guilt can’t make up for anything.
	When the lights in the operating room are off, Jamie's eyes looks up and the door opens. Dan is pushed out.
	He is pushed back into the ward.
	Amelia is unwilling and wants to follow up. But Derek stops in front of her, and he says coldly, "Amelia, Dan needs to rest."
	Amelia is dumbfounded. Does Derek mean to stop her from seeing Dan?
	Jamie gives her a light look and walks into the ward.
	"What about her? Why can she go in?" Amelia points at Jamie who has just entered, staring at Derek angrily.
	If it's not Derek who is standing in front of her and stopping her now, she has already intruded!
	"Jamie is the exception." Derek answers officially.
	Exception? Amelia widens her eyes in anger, looking at Derek who is stopping her from getting in. She has no other choice but to stomp on the foot and leave angrily.
	Derek moves away and stands by the door of the ward.
	"She's gone. You can get up. Your acting is really good." There is a silence in the ward for a while, and then Jamie's humorous voice comes out.

Chapter 199 How Do You Find It?
	Dan, who still looks pale on the bed, opens his eyes leisurely and his lips raises. He looks at her gently, "How do you find it?"
	Jamie snorts dismissively and takes a big apple from the side. When she opens her mouth and is about to bite, she finds that she doesn’t brush her teeth. Then she puts down the apple although she is reluctant. She says, “Your clothes are not messy all the time and even the position of the bandage remains unchanged. If your wound really recurs, will the doctor not take your clothes off and change the dressing? "
	Dan's black eyes flick with amazement and he watches her with a little imperceptible affection, "Go on."
	"Then for those doctors. If you really go into the operating room again because of the wound recurrence, why don’t those doctors tell me to let me take care of you in the future when they come out? They even leave without a word. What does that mean? "
	Jamie raises her chin proudly. She is worried at first. But when Dan is pushed out, these worries become skeptical thoughts.
	She looks helplessly at the man lying on the bed and scolds him in her heart. He can come up with this kind of idea to scare Amelia. How helpless is he with Amelia?
	"Well." Dan smiles in a low voice. He doesn't expect the girl to be quite careful and clever that she can find it.
	He is hurt because the wound has been torn a little bit but it isn't very serious. It is just to scare Amelia so that he goes into the operating room again.
	After this time, Amelia probably dares not to come over again.
	Thinking of this, Dan is a little bit helpless. If it is for others, he can let her out like what he does to Jozo, or let Derek throw her out.
	Well, for this younger sister, the young lady who is spoiled from childhood, he, her brother, is also the one to be blamed.
	Dan lowers his eyes to think about it. Does he spoil Amelia?
	"As for Amelia, it’s her normal character. You don't have to care about her behavior." This unintentional explanation makes her a little stunned.
	But soon that feelings change into ironic one. Of course, Amelia is his sister. Even if she comes to provoke her again, what can she comment to her?
	Jamie looks up at Dan for a few seconds. Then she gets up and goes to the bathroom to wash herself.
	After washing, she takes out the washing utensils and helps him wash. His right hand cannot move, and he is unwilling to move his left hand. Jamie has no choice but to help him by herself.
	Dan knows why she changes her expression because of his words just now. And he is a little bit agitated now.
	Facing this delicate and indifferent little face, he actually has a bit of guilt.
	After severing the boss to finish his breakfast, Jamie takes her bag and is about to go out.
	"Where are you going?" Dan looks up at her unpleasantly. Is she going to company? Her boss is still lying here. What can she do at the company?
	"Mr. William, you have put too much attention on me. Should I report to you about where do I go?" Jamie's footsteps move faster and she walks out of the ward.
	She doesn’t notice Dan's horrible face behind her. And she walks over Derek towards the elevator.
	"Derek, follow her." Dan's words contain a bit of anger.
	This damn girl. Her courage is really getting bigger!
	"Yes." Derek responds, following Jamie skillfully. For the matters like monitoring the whereabouts of Jamie for his boss, he is really getting more and more proficient...
	If he is found, Derek even can image his dark and endless future.
	Without filming activity today, Jamie leaves the hospital. She stops a taxi on the roadside and leaves the hospital.
	Where Jamie goes is another hospital.
	It is the hospital where Jack and Celina are in.
	There are too many things recently and she almost forgets the existence of these two people.
	The Moores is not much better. The leader is lying in the hospital. The Moore lacks their leader at the moment. Dan's deliberate targeting from time to time even puts the already dangerous Moores in a danger.
	However, it is not Jamie's ultimate goal to bring down the Moores.
	Strict security...
	Although someone is guarding at the door, Jamie reports her name and those people let her in.
	Jack is awake but is still very weak, lying there without moving. His appearance is far from the astute image that Jamie has seen in the past. But what is this called?
	Miss Moore laughs without kindness.
	This is called retribution.
	She is not Jack's biological daughter. Jack has poisoned her mother. Naturally, she can't be stupid enough to come here every day to visit the murderer who kills her mom.
	For Mia, she hears that she disappears. The police have not found her until now. The Moores has only two daughters. So even Jack is lying in the hospital during this period, it is lonely here. The relatives, who curry favor with the Moore, have only been here for a few times.
	In the eyes of the outside world, the Moore is almost gone now.
	Who will come to please them as before?
	There is no kinship in any rich and powerful family. Sometimes it only talks about the benefits, especially in her family. Hasn’t Jamie seen enough?
	"Dad, what's wrong with you? How do you hurt so badly? Look at you. You look so old!" Jamie holds the smiles on her face and walks to Jack. She stands in front of him and has a play with exaggeration.
	Jack sees Jamie coming. Hearing what she says, she just says it to mock him while she says so calmly. All his temper comes up again for a while.
	"You’re a filial daughter! What are you talking about? Your father has been lying here for so long. As a daughter, don't you even know to visit me?" Jack glares at Jamie.
	Jamie puts away her exaggerated expression and says thoughtfully, "Oh, I can’t remember things well so that I forget it."
	Jack hasn't planned to hear good words from Jamie. But he doesn't expect her to say so directly. Does she forget?
	She really dares to say so!
	There are noisy voices next to him. Jamie looks up and sees Celina who wakes up. She doesn’t know when she is awake. She is staring at Jamie with her bloody eyes, as if she will strip her in the next second.
	"Wow, aren’t you my stepmother? I rarely come back. So, are you very touched?" Jamie is a little puzzled, since Celina doesn't actually scold her by pointing at her nose when she sees her as usual. It seems a bit strange.
	This is not the style of this shrew.
	Celina hums as if she can’t say anything. A trace of annoyance shows up on her face.
	Can't she speak?
	Jamie blinks and asks, "What's wrong with my stepmother? Why does she seem happy?"
	As soon as this sentence is spoken, Celina stares at her with hatred and hostility.
	Jack sighs and looks at Jamie with a complicated feeling. He is very helpless to this daughter. "Your stepmother hurt her throat because of the explosion and cannot speak for a short time."
	
Chapter 200 Good and Evil Must at Last Have Their Reward
	Really?
	Jamie's eyes lights up. She doesn't know who is so kind to bring the explosion to the Moore. It doesn’t explode in others’ house but the Moore’s house?
	Ian, who is sitting in the classroom happily in class, suddenly feels a chill and he shivers. His big eyes blinks and he looks at the bright sky outside the window. Then he scratches his head.
	He mutters, "It’s so strange. It's not cold today. Why do I shiver...?”
	"Aunt Celina, how the saying goes. Good and evil must at last have their reward. Maybe you have done something evil." Jamie looks at Celina and shakes her head very regretfully. Others may think that they have an intimate relationship between the mother and daughter.
	Celina's red eyes show her hatred to Jamie, and she is trembling angrily for Jamie's words.
	Finally, she is so angry that she becomes faint.
	"Dad, why is Aunt Celina fainted?" Jamie sees her fainting and feels ecstatic. But she pretends to be innocent.
	"Enough!" Jack is very irritable, as if he doesn't want to continue this topic, "Celina will wake up after a while. But Jamie, I have something to ask you."
	Jamie?
	Jamie frowns. Jack used to call her by full name all day and night. Today he is very abnormal.
	"If you have anything, just say it." Jamie takes a stool and sits down without a word.
	Jack is a little dissatisfied with her behavior but he seems to be accustomed to it, "How is your relationship with Mr. William now?"
	How can it be?
	In fact, when Jack goes to Dan’s manor to find Jamie that day, he finds that Jamie and Dan have a love relationship. But he wants to check it with Jamie.
	"Why do you ask about this? It’s bad!" Jamie's face is not calm, but her tone is perfunctory.
	As expected, Jack won’t tell her anything. The only thing he can say is about the interests of the Moore.
	"You also know that our family is already unstable now. So I'm afraid that if it goes on like this, it will ..." Jack explains, but he is observing Jamie's reaction.
	However, Jamie doesn't care about all this, and she nods peacefully, "Then?"
	"You are also the daughter of our family. You don’t want to see the Moore to go bankrupt in this way, right?" Jack also gets used to it and answers calmly.
	Jamie knows in her heart what he is thinking about. He just wants to use her to save the Moore.
	"Of course I can't watch the Moore to go bankrupt. I don't know what dad wants your daughter to do?" Jamie pretends to be worried.
	Jack is a crafty man. Hearing this matter is likely available, he continues to guide her. "As long as you help the Moore in front of Mr. William, he will certainly not hurt your dignity."
	Jamie sneers in the bottom of his heart. "What self-confidence does dad have to thinks so? I'm nothing for Mr. William."
	"I can see that Mr. William has interests on you. As long as you demand, he will promise you!"
	"But Mr. William is not willing to care about me now. How can I demand?" Jamie says this deliberately, wanting to see how Jack will react next.
	As expected, Jack glances at Jamie with some disappointment.
	Jamie still looks wronged, lowering her head.
	"Then, I'll give you an idea. It's possible to work out!" Jack looks at Jamie for a while.
	"What?" Jamie sees him wink at her and lean closer.
	Jack says a few words near her ear. Jamie's complexion gradually becomes bad.
	Jamie looks at Jack coldly. "Do you let me to sleep with him and please him?"
	Jamie doesn't feel so uncomfortable in her heart. She only feels that it is really ridiculous. She feels very lucky that this man is not her biological father!
	Jack doesn't even realize that her eyes shows hatred, and he still talks eloquently, "No one can bear these. If you take the initiative to dedicate yourself, he will definitely not refuse you. Then he can take the Moore to a rich situation, which is really wonderful!"
	Jamie sneers in the bottom of her heart. He uses her when she is useful and throws her away when she has no value. His family is really interesting.
	Under the circumstances, he still wants to use her. Does he really live too well?
	"Dad is good at really kidding. Don't you say that I will be nothing without the identity of the Moore? Then how can Dan like someone who is nothing?" Jamie's eyes look indifferent.
	"Jamie, are you reluctant to please Mr. William?" Jack's smart eyes are fixed on Jamie and he is waiting for Jamie's answer.
	"I’m not unwilling." Jamie answers slowly, "Dad, then you can wait for the good news from your daughter."
	Jack is a little stunned. As long as the goal is achieved the Moore will be saved, everything isn’t a big deal.
	Jamie doesn't stay there for a long time. Jack, who has achieved his goal, just talks with her for a while and lets Jamie go back.
	After leaving the hospital, Jamie is not in a hurry to go back to Dan. Thinking about the words that Jack has told her just now, she feels sick.
	Can this kind of person be more disgusting?
	Let her please Dan? Why doesn’t he make sweet dreams and go die with his fantasy?
	Jamie considers for a while and decides to call Chris.
	After the phone is connected, there comes Chris's sexy voice, "Jamie? Why do you call me suddenly? Do you miss me?"
	"Yeah, I miss you." Jamie's gloomy mood is suddenly cleaned, and her voice is also cheerful. She is just like a little girl who is coquetry with her loved ones.
	"Is Jack bothering you again?" Chris suddenly realizes something wrong and asks.
	"No, how can it be. Do I call you for such trivial thing?" Jamie wanders slowly on the street, not telling Chris what he has just said.
	She is afraid that they will worry about her in France. But she can’t help but want to make a phone call and wants to hear their voices.
	And for his dad, he is very busy. Every time he finds the time to visit her and Ian, he would hurry to return.
	In Jamie's impression, his father is a handsome uncle. Chris's handsomeness comes almost entirely from his genes, and she even inherits Adele's genes.
	
Chapter 201 He Is a Very Gentle Man
	He is a very gentle man, but he keeps calm when making any decision.
	He wants Jamie to go to France with him and live with them, but Jamie refuses.
	So, the distance between the families lengthens.
	"Dad is missing you every day and wants you to come back. We miss you so much that we’re sick." Chris's voice has a trace of sorrow and blame.
	"What? Are you sick?" Jamie's hand tightens worriedly when she hears it.
	"No, it isn’t. It’s called lovesickness." Chris is a little puzzled, thinking about whether it is right.
	Oops!
	Jamie almost smiled and smirked. Was this elder brother a teasing monkey?
	"Chris, lovesickness is used to describe men and women." Jamie explains to him patiently.
	"For men and women? I'm a man, you're a woman. Is there any problem?" Chris says with a trace of doubt.
	"Emm…"
	Jamie doesn't know how to explain it with his words. So she can just say, "Yes, this is lovesickness ..."
	"Jamie. If you really encounter something, don't fight against it alone. I still have man over there. You can come to find your brother if you have any troubles." Chris's voice becomes soft and he carefully tells Jamie.
	"Brother, who is that man you are talking about?" Jamie walks to the commercial street but doesn't walk in. She just stands outside and chats with Chris.
	She looks around habitually. She seems to have an illusion that she sees Jozo.
	Putting away the doubts in her heart, Jamie walks straightly over there.
	"This is a secret. If you want to know it, you'll have to find it by yourself." Chris is still keeping Jamie guessing and keeping it confidential.
	"..." Jamie pouts. Since that Chris doesn't want to say, he certainly has his intentions.
	After a few chats, Jamie hangs up the phone and is still getting closer and closer to Jozo. But she doesn’t know that a car passes by suddenly. And when she looks at it, there is nobody there.
	"It’s so strange. Do I get the wrong person?" Jamie thinks she may recognize it mistakenly, and she doesn't think much about it.
	_
	Jozo comes out with Alma, but Alma is just called by her to go to a store to buy things. Jozo doesn't want to wait for her, so she comes in the mall by moving her wheelchair.
	She doesn't do it for anything else. The reason she escapes from Alma is just to finish the appointment.
	Jozo moves her wheelchair to an intersection and is about to make a turn. But she doesn't expect a person coming head-on. Therefore accidentally she rushes straightly on him.
	"Ah!"
	The two collides together, but fortunately the man reacts promptly and he stabilizes the wheelchair so Jozo avoids falling off the wheelchair.
	Jozo is also in shock. But the strong fragrance of perfume makes her frown.
	"Ah! July! Are you okay?" A girl in casual clothes runs over anxiously and asks.
	July straightens up and looks at Jozo. She asks, "Lady, are you okay?"
	"It's okay." Jozo thinks that she is familiar and she looks at July carefully.
	This lady seems to be a famous model of Dan’s company.
	"It’s better that you’re okay. This is my business card. If you think you have any problems, please contact me." July hands Jozo a business card of her own.
	Jozo doesn't speak but just nods.
	July and her assistant don’t stay for too long and leave first.
	Jozo looks at their back. She raises her right hand that had been on her side. There is a small pendant hanging on it.
	This is just accidentally caught by her finger when July hits her. Originally, this thing is clasped tightly around her waist by July. However, the force is so strong that it is caught by her.
	This lady and Dan had a gossip before. And she hits her today. She will definitely settle accounts with her in the future.
	Jozo throws the pendant in her bag at random, and moves her wheelchair to leave.
	In a relatively remote and quiet cafe on the commercial street.
	Jozo moves her wheelchair to the designated location in the cafe as agreed with the man.
	The location is very biased. When Jozo gets there, she finds that the person is already waiting there. But because of the light, she can’t see his face clearly.
	"This is a good seat." Jozo is sitting opposite the man. The stool in her position has been removed, so that it becomes convenient for her to settle the wheelchair.
	There is a trace of doubt in Jozo's beautiful eyes. This person seems to have investigated her.
	"It’s good if Jozo thinks that it's convenient." The man's voice seems to be deliberately lowered. Obviously he doesn’t want Jozo to know who he is.
	Jozo doesn't care either. She picks up the coffee on the table and takes a sip. She says, "Tell me what benefit you want from helping me."
	After being silent for a while, the man suddenly breaks the silence. "I don't know what Jozo can do for me."
	Jozo can feel the man's gaze, which makes her dislike.
	"I only have one request, that is, to completely destroy the relationship between Jamie and Dan!"
	Hearing the direct words of the man who sits opposite, Jozo is even more curious about this man. She doesn’t expect that they would hit it off easily.
	"Deal!"
	The purpose of this person is Jamie, and she only wants Dan.
	In this way, they are still friends on the same line.
	"Jozo doesn't need to think too much. We are destined to be different people." The man says coldly.
	Jozo is shocked in her heart and begins to sweat. This man, why can he understand her mind...
	"I believe Jozo is a smart person and hope that we can cooperate happily."
	"What do you mean?"
	But the silence on the opposite side is terrifying. Has the man on the other side already left?
	She takes out her mobile phone to take a picture.
	The man has really left when she doesn’t know.
	Jozo is even more curious in her heart. This man can leave so quietly ... Who is he?
	She doesn’t know anything about the man, but it is obvious that the man knows her well...
	…
	When Jamie returns to the hospital, she sees Dan leaning on the bed and looking at the documents.
	The man who works conscientiously is really handsome!
	Jamie's heart is touched and it beats violently a few times. Her small hand rests on the doorknob and fails to regain her mind for a while.
	She ... She does think that Dan looks very attractive to her!
	But she has to admit that this scene reminds Jamie of high school’s life, Dan accompanied her from time to time to study at night although in most of time he was teaching her. She slept on the table happily. But every time when she waked up in the next morning, what Jamie saw was that all the homework have been done.
Chapter 202 She Is Just ... Absent-minded
	From then on, Jamie became more and more dependent on Dan, and it was Dan who finished her homework alone in the future. And she occupied his bed without any psychological barriers and she slept well on it.
	At that time, she didn’t think Dan was so attractive.
	Why?
	Dan has already found Jamie standing by the door, thinking about leaving her alone for a while. But after a long time, he doesn't see her coming in, so he looks up.
	Actually she is in a trance.
	Dan feels it funny. And only she can stand in a daze and forgets to come in. What a foolish girl.
	It is for only a moment that Jamie is absent-minded and she quickly recovers. But she sees that Dan is looking at her and his black eyes reflect a little interests on her, which makes her embarrassed.
	She is just ... absent-minded.
	So stupid she is. How will she be distracted here?
	"Come here." Dan raises his lips and puts the papers aside, waving at her.
	On the table next to it, a large stack of documents is brought by Secretary Sam from the company.
	Jamie secretly scolds herself for being so stupid and she comes over while moving her pace. Seeing the steaming meals on the table, she frowns. Hasn’t he eaten yet?
	Wait a minute ... She haven’t eaten yet either.
	"Are you going to have the meal?" Jamie thinks that his injury is caused to save Ian, and she leaves so arrogantly just now and leaves him alone. The more she thinks about it, the more she feels that she is wrong. So she smiles pleasantly and looks at Dan...
	Dan snorts. Does she still remember whether he eats or not?
	He doesn't speak and Jamie just regards it as his answer. Then she picks up the porcelain bowl on the table, which contains medicated rice porridge, a bowl of rice and some light dishes. They are all nutritious.
	Jamie doesn't forget that his right hand is injured. So she mixes it with the spoon in the porcelain bowl a few times to let the heat from the porridge dissipate. It won’t be so hot. Then she takes a bit and sends it to Dan's mouth.
	Dan still doesn't speak and just stares at Jamie's eyes with his dark and narrow eyes. He doesn’t move and doesn't open his mouth.
	Jamie can’t bear it under his sights and her fingertips tremble. She thinks secretly that what’s wrong with this man again. She feeds him by herself. Anyway, he has to open his mouth.
	"Mr. William ..." Jamie just wants to persuade him but finds that Dan's eyes look a little bit cold. Subconsciously, she immediately changes her words, "Dan ..."
	Sure enough, his eyes suddenly relax.
	Jamie's mouth twitches. Well, well. Does he want to be so arrogant?
	"Dan, have some porridge." Jamie holds the spoon near his lips and has some expectation on her small face, expecting him to eat it quickly because her hands feels sore ...
	Dan glances at the medicinal material in the spoon, frowning a little bit disgustedly. He finally opens his mouth. "Too hot."
	Jamie's mouth twitches again, and the porcelain bowl in her hand almost can’t be held by her. She glances at the porridge on the spoon. How will it be hot after it is ignored for a few times? It almost turns into a warm temperature.
	It's really hard to serve him.
	So Jamie puts the spoon on her lips to blow for a while and sends to him again. But Dan still refuses to open his mouth.
	Jamie is a little bit angry right now. Is he really teasing her?
	"You’re so impatient." Dan glances at her lightly. His eyes instantly remind Jamie of the scene of him rushing to hold Ian in his arms. The anger in her heart is instantly extinguished as if it is covered by cold water…
	"What do you want?" Jamie's attitude softens, looking at him with a pair of clear eyes, and then she asks.
	Dan's heart is moved by her eyes. But he still doesn’t forget to tease her, "Why do you send it to me without trying the temperature? What if it burns me?"
	He is unreasonable! If Ian is here, he’s going to disdain Dan's unreasonable behavior!
	The fool Jamie does not live up to Dan's guidance and she really feels herself stupid. If Dan is really burned, it will be her fault. She is now guilty for his wounds.
	How will this fool girl understand the tricks in Dan's mind? She takes a small sip of porridge and tries the temperature. She knows that the temperature is just fine. So she sends to Dan's mouth in a silly manner, "It’s not hot.”
	Dan looks at her dumb look. The arc of his lips rises up even more. Looking at the puffy face in front of him, he is almost unable to restrain himself from squeezing it. Fortunately, his reason stops him.
	He opens his mouth and eats the medicinal porridge in the spoon. He even licks his lips after eating.
	Jamie's fingers trembles, and she feels that the blood in her body will continue to flow into her head. He is too ... too attractive!
	She calms herself down and feeds him another spoon.
	If Ian is there, he will definitely shake his head while being pitiful and saying that Jamie is stupid. He will laugh while covers his small mouth, saying that they are not ashamed.
	Jamie is, stupidly sending herself to the big boss...
	The porcelain bowl is not big and Dan doesn’t eat a lot. After such a process, until the porridge in the bowl is eaten, then he looks at Jamie putting the bowl down with a little pity.
	But they have a long time. Dan is not in a hurry. It is like boiling a frog in warm water. It turns out to be just the opposite of his wish if he is too anxious.
	"Why does it still have rice?" Jamie only says her doubts at this time. Dan doesn't eat too much. It's too wasteful to prepare so much. She is still hungry.
	"That's for you." Dan takes the file from one side. He glances at it lightly and answers.
	"Oh." Jamie nods happily, and then she picks up the porcelain bowl with white rice. She looks at the dishes and suddenly her face wrinkles. Why is it all vegetable dishes?
	She doesn't like vegetable dishes. She likes meat, meat!
	"What's wrong?" Although Dan's eyes are on the file, he still pays attention to her from time to time. Seeing that she is not having the meal now, he asks.
	"It's okay ..." Jamie bites her chopsticks involuntarily, but her eyes show her reluctance. Eating vegetable dishes is too difficult for her.
	Dan glances at the dishes on the table. His eyebrows lightly frown. He doesn’t find something troubles just now. But now, she is likely depressed because she doesn't eat meat.
	"Derek, let them prepare a new dish. It shall have meat." Dan turns his head and says to Derek outside the door.
	Derek's hearing is good, and he can hear it at a certain distance from the door panel. He murmurs, "Yes”. Then he comes to prepare it.
	Naturally, it is impossible for Dan to eat the food prepared by the hospital. The food is made by specially-assigned person.
	Hearing his words, Jamie relaxes her wrinkled little face finally and secretly looks at Dan who is next to her. She finds that his face looks calm. His eyes stop on the file. There is tender on his lightly eyebrow peak, which makes him seem to be easygoing.
	
Chapter 203 Do You Remember the Demonstration Just Now?
	Boom! Boom!
	The sound of the heart beating is so obvious that Jamie fails not to pay attention to it.
	Jamie is a little depressed while covering her chest. How will the heart has been beating so fast recently? Is there something wrong with the heart?
	Dan keeps silent for Jamie's small movements. He raises his lips and decides a plan in his heart.
	He knows that it will be impossible for Jamie to express her love. This little fool. Maybe she doesn’t find that she already falls in love with him.
	After Jamie finishes her meal, she takes out the laptop Ian brings to her from the manor and begins to make a drawing, which is a picture of the clothing style.
	Dan is reading the document which will be set aside after he reads. He doesn’t need to sign.
	The atmosphere in the room is quiet and easy-going. No one makes a sound, resulting in a good atmosphere of peace.
	No one knows how long it takes. Dan has read the documents on the table and he is playing a pen between his fingers. When Jamie stretches out, some lights flash in his dark eyes.
	"Come here," he calls lazily.
	Jamie glances back and puts the laptop which is on her lap on the table and stands up to walk towards him.
	Because of the long work, her legs are slightly paralyzed. As if there are countless ants biting her legs, which is uncomfortable.
	"What's the matter?" She walks over to him and sits by the bed next to him. But she sees him giving her the pen in his hand.
	"Can you imitate?" He asks.
	Jamie is a little stunned, holding the pen in her small hand and shaking her head.
	"I can teach you."
	While saying, Dan stretches out his arms around Jamie's thin waist, making her closer to him. He grabs her small hand with her right hand and arranges the pen to a right position.
	Although his hands can’t use force, it is still easy to teach her to imitate his signature.
	He takes a draft paper and wraps her small hand tightly with his big hand. And then he signs his signature on it. Although the force is usually weak, the handwriting seems to be nice, natural and smooth like floating clouds and flowing water.
	Jamie's petite body is almost nestled in Dan's arms and she shrinks into a small ball, which takes up little space. For convenience, she takes off her shoes and is held by Dan in his arms with her back attached to his chest. She can clearly feel the powerful heartbeat coming from the place of his chest.
	One beat and another beat. Jamie's heart is messed up by him.
	The heart, which has been quiet, is even more excited.
	"Do you remember the demonstration just now?" Dan's voice is very low and charming, like the sound from a cello.
	Jamie's head is near his throat, and she feels the slight trembles from his throat.
	"What?" She is thinking about something else. How can she remember it?
	"Look." Dan sighs softly. Fortunately, at this time he is covered with a quilt. Jamie is wearing a pair of shorts. The quilt can partly reduce the touch of their skin. Otherwise Dan is really worried that he will not be able to control himself here.
	He has a weak willpower for Jamie.
	Originally he just wants to teach her to imitate his handwriting and signs the document. Now, it is him who suffers a lot.
	Jamie doesn’t dare to be absent-minded, watching Dan slowing down his speed. He holds her little hand and moves on the scratch paper.
	Jamie always thinks that her hands are cool at all times, so the hands of others must be cool. But it seems that she does not find that Dan's hands are very warm until today.
	Held by his hands, even her whole person is warmed up.
	Dan's speed is very slow. He’s afraid she can't see clearly at any step. His name has many strokes, but it is not too complicated to write. It is a bit complicated for Jamie.
	"Try it." He lets go of her small hand and says.
	Jamie is a little lost, watching his hand moving away and pouting. She doesn’t know why she likes the feeling when he holds her hand like that.
	He suddenly lets go her hand, and she feels a little bit unhappy.
	Um ... What should she do?
	Jamie's eyes roll around when Dan can’t see her. Then she grabs the pen and begins to copy his handwriting on the scratch paper.
	
Chapter 204 Maybe This Is A Kind of Obsession
	Jamie Moore withdraws her hand after finishing the last straw. She looks at the handwriting on the draft paper, and she is very satisfied with this.
	But Dan William is not satisfied with this, because what she writes doesn’t resemble the words he writes at all.
	Then Dan William grasps her small hand to writes on the draft paper again.
	"Do you understand it?" He asks.
	Jamie Moore nods. She looks at his imitation of handwriting seriously as she writes on the scratchpad.
	"No." Dan William shakes his head and looks at the beautiful font on the draft paper. No one would believe that this is Dan William’s signature.
	"Come on, please. Look at my gesture, and you should pay attention to every stroke..." Dan William wraps the small hand of Jamie Moore with his big hand, and then he writes on the draft paper.
	Because the signature should be wrote in a continuous way. He can't teach her one stroke by another stroke, thus he could only write in a slow way.
	But Dan William doesn’t know that Jamie Moore writes it wrong on purpose, and she doesn’t imitate Dan William.
	Maybe the reason is that Dan William’s hands are warm.
	Is that true?
	Jamie Moore turns her head, and looks at the attentive expression of Dan William. They are very close to each other, and Jamie Moore even could feel the warm breath of Dan William spraying on her neck. If he turns his head at this time, they would kiss with each other.
	Jamie Moore forgets that Dan William is teaching her how to imitate his signature. She looks at the face of Dan William, and even loses her mind for a moment.
	"Have you got it?" Dan William withdraws his hand after finishing the last straw. He looks at Jamie Moore, and then he finds Jamie Moore, who should look at the draft paper, is looking at him.
	Dan William blinks his eyes. He finds that Jamie Moore is looking at him in a sweet way.
	This is the second time that Jamie Moore looks at him in a daze.
	It’s different from the last time when he wakes up. So he should see it more clearly this time. Because Jamie Moore doesn’t hide this time, and she even doesn’t notice that he is looking at her.
	There is move and love in her eyes, isn’t it?
	Dan William has seen such sights in his own eyes for several times. When he looks at Jamie Moore, he would look at her in such a way.
	Since Dan William finds Jamie Moore likes him, how could he bear it?
	He puts down the pen in his hand, and then he turns Jamie Moore’s face to himself with his hand. Then he holds her face, and then kisses Jamie Moore.
	He feels that Jamie Moore’s lips are very soft, and it is just like jelly.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t know what is going on. She feels that someone is biting her lips, thus she opens her mouth subconsciously.
	Dan William takes this advantage to kiss Jamie Moore heavily. He kisses her heavily, and she almost loses her breath in his kiss.
	Dan William is very skillful in kissing. Jamie Moore almost loses herself in his kiss, and she is in a dizzy.
	How could he kiss her suddenly?
	"Well..." Oxygen, oxygen!
	Jamie Moore hums. It seems that Dan William wants to swallow her. She can’t bear this, and she even lacks oxygen, thus she couldn't help but pushing him away.
	Dan William realizes that Jamie Moore feels uncomfortable. He stops kissing her, and puts his forehead against hers. He looks at her with deep dark eyes, and breathes heavily.
	Jamie is no better than him. She is short of oxygen for a long time, thus she breathes the fresh air quickly. Her delicate little face is very red, and she looks very attractive now.
	"Don’t you know how to change breath?" Dan William presses his lips, and it seems that he is in a good mood. But when he sees Jamie Moore even can’t change breath during the kiss, he decides that she should practice hard, thus she will make a breakthrough.
	If Jamie Moore knows his thinking, she will scold him heavily.
	"You..." Jamie Moore’s face is very red. And she could not speak anything. She could only hit him with her little fist. She hits him lightly, and there is no threat at all.
	"How could you kiss me without permission?” Jamie Moore stares at him, and she doesn’t realize that she is lying in his arms, and their posture is very ambiguous.
	"Someone stares at me for a long time, and she even loses her mind when she looks at me. I think you love me, am I right?” Dan William looks at the woman in his arms, and then holds Jamie Moore tightly.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Does she lose her mind just now?
	It’s seems that she is staring at him just now. But how could he know she loves him?
	Jamie Moore looks at the rosy lips of him. She swallows saliva in her mouth. It seems that she really likes him.
	It’s obvious that Dan William is very complacent. This girl has a idea on him. This means that she doesn’t hate the kissing from him. What’s more, she even expects this.
	"So do you admit this?"
	Jamie Moore loses her mind. As long as she hears the voice of Dan William, she gets back her minds.
	She is in a daze. Why? Why does she like Dan William?
	Why does she like the warm temperature of his hand?
	Why…
	Does it because…
	Jamie Moore stares at Dan William, and she looks at Dan William in an unbelievable way. Is it true that she likes Dan William?
	"Yes, it’s all right. I’m sure that you love me.” As soon as she realizes this idea in her mind, the voice of Dan William lingers around her. Dan William says in a soft way, and now he looks very attractive.
	
Chapter 205 Dose she like Dan William?
	She always thinks this in her mind, but now she should say it out. These words are just like a magic spell that strangles Jamie Moore heavily.
	Dose she like Dan William？
	Dose she like Dan William？
	Jamie Moore is frightened by her own idea. She looks at the Dan William who wears a smile on his face. She wants to leave here subconsciously!
	But how could Dan William let Jamie Moore leave so easily?
	She wishes.
	Before Jamie Moore leaves the arms of Dan William, she is pulled by him, and then she falls down on his arms again.
	They stay close with each other. Her face is against his chest. She could smell the fragrance of his body.
	Thus Jamie Moore’s face is very red.
	She is in a panic at all.
	"Don't move. You will find how fast your heart beats." Hearing Dan William’s voice, Jamie Moore stops struggling. She follows his words and keeps quiet.
	Splash! Splash!
	Her heart beats heavily.
	Jamie Moore covers her face. This is her heartbeat, and it's so fast and violent. It seems that he wants her to admit the fact that she likes Dan William.
	It happens too suddenly, and Dan William wants her to admit her thought. Even though she is very brave, she can’t bear it.
	“I’m sure that you love me.”
	You love me.
	You love me.
	This sentence explodes in Jamie Moore's mind suddenly, which makes her even more at a loss.
	She likes Dan William - This sentence resounds in Jamie Moore’s mind. Her face is very red, and it seems that blood will drip from her face.
	Dan William knows the thinking of Jamie Moore from the expression of her. Fortunately, he doesn't let her go. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for her to admit her ideas.
	"Jamie Moore." His voice is deep and charming, and he gently moves away the little hands that are covering her face. He looks straight into the eyes of Jamie Moore, thus Jamie Moore has no place to hide.
	"Please look at my eyes, and then tell me - Do you love me?"
	It seems that his eyes are magical and charming. Jamie Moore, who is in a trance, calms down suddenly. She looks at his eyes, and that sentence penetrates into her heart bit by bit.
	Does she love him?
	She loves him.
	Jamie Moore loves Dan William.
	"I love you." Jamie Moore nods obediently. She says the most real feeling in her heart under the gaze of Dan William.
	Dan William’s heart jumps heavily. The smile on his face becomes more charming. He asks, "Who do you love?"
	“I love you.”
	She feels that her heart jumps abnormally in recent days. Is that because she loves Dan William?
	In the past, Jamie Moore could escape and cover it up with other things. But at this time, she could not escape. No matter for Dan William or her heart, she could not escape any more.
	She loves Dan William.
	Jamie Moore is in a daze. After thinking for a while, she gets her sense suddenly.
	"I......" Dan William hugs her gently in his arms. He holds the small hands of Jamie Moore, and he looks at her sweetly. He opens his mouth, and he wants to say something to Jamie Moore.
	"No!" Jamie Moore pushes Dan William away suddenly. Her clear eyes suddenly become complicated. She bites her lips, and tries all her efforts to hide the grievances in her heart.
	How could she say the true feelings in her heart out suddenly? Does she love him?
	"What's the matter?" Dan William frowns. He is a little bit confused. It seems that Jamie Moore is not in a good mood, and now she is different from that shy and silly girl just now.
	He could feel that the emotion of Jamie Moore is related to him.
	However, Dan William thinks that he had never done anything bad to her. How could she…
	"Dan William, you really think too much." A moment later, Jamie Moore says quietly, and her voice is very cold.
	"Do I like you?" She raises her head and looks straight at the confused eyes of Dan William. She sneers. "Just now, it's just a play to match your pride. You think too high of yourself."
	The word of Jamie Moore just likes a sharp sword that stabs on the soft heart of Dan William relentlessly.
	He asks her just now - Who does she love?
	She answers - she loves him.
	It’s the first time for him to hear these words from her - He loves her.
	But how could the words change suddenly?
	Dan William opens his eyes suddenly, and his beautiful face is cold and fierce. The atmosphere around him is also very cold.
	Jamie Moore shivers when she looks at his eyes. She could feel that Dan William is very dangerous now.
	She takes a step back subconsciously, but she is held by one hand of Dan William. Then Dan William pulls her into his arms vigorously.
	Dan William holds the delicate chin of Jamie Moore tightly. And there is a cool smile on the corner of his lips. He looks very cold. "Do you think I treasure the love from you?”
	"You are as the same as those women. Why do you think I love you?”
	His words resound in the ears of Jamie Moore.
	It's like hardening poison, which tears Jamie Moore’s heart up hardly. Then the poison punches in her body until blood oozes out.
	Tears fall down from her eyes uncontrollably. He hurts her so much with such a bad word.
	Tears fall on the back of the hand of Dan William. Dan William’s eyes blink and then his body shivers slightly.
	But he calms down with the reason in his heart. He loosens his hand hardly, thus Jamie Moore is thrown to one side. Jamie Moore feels pain on her chin.
	"Don't think that I kiss you for love. If not for Ian Moore, you are not worthy of staying beside me."
	The cold voice of him resounds above Jamie Moore’s head. Jamie Moore bits her lips, and she is in a daze, thus tears fall from her eyes quickly.
	Dan William clenches his fist and wants to keeps a little respect for himself. He doesn’t want to be an idiot. He still wants to wipe tear for her after hearing those words.
	Why does Jamie Moore think she could hurt him?
	She depends on that he loves her.
	What if Dan William doesn’t love her?
	Dan William really wants to hold her shoulder and tell her, if I don’t love you, you are nothing in my eyes!
	“Get out now!”
	He closes his eyes, and then says in an extremely cold way, thus Jamie Moore feels very painful.
	How could she be so painful?
	"I let you out!" Dan William says in a loud way, and his voice is full of impatience.
	Jamie Moore stands up from the bed, and then she puts on her shoes in a trance. She picks her bag up, and leaves without stopping.
Chapter 206 You Think Too High of Yourself
	It’s the first time for Dan William to get angry with her.
	Jamie Moore knows that Dan William is very angry.
	Her heart beats heavily, and she feels very painful.
	Dan William frowns heavily after Jamie Moore leaves. He is not so cold now, and there is a real sadness and loneliness in his black eyes.
	The words of Jamie Moore hurt him heavily. It hurts him more than the face that she doesn’t like him and refuses him.
	Maybe she doesn’t know that her words are just like a sharp blade that can easily pierce the chest for those who loves her deeply!
	Dan William feels tired and powerless suddenly. He has been falling in love with her for a long time, and he has been waiting for her for such a long time. Now he hears this sentence - You think too high of yourself.
	He looks at the bed. The bed is a bit messy, and he even could see the trace of tears on the bed.
	All these tell him clearly that she cried here just now.
	It’s him that let her cry.
	Dan William feels bad when he thinks of the tear of Jamie Moore, and he touches the draft paper beside him.
	There are not only a few signatures of him, but also some beautiful font of Jamie Moore. It’s just like a joke.
	He grabs the paper without thinking, and then he throws it into the waste basket at will after rubbing it.
	When Jamie Moore leaves the hospital, she is still in a trance. She feels that her heart is so painful that she can hardly breathe.
	She feels that her eyes are dry, and the cold wind has dried the tears on her face.
	The phone rings suddenly. She takes the phone out of her pocket, and then answers the phone, “Hello?”
	It’s a call from Wendy. She wants to ask Jamie Moore to eat delicate food. But when the phone is answered, she finds that the voice of Jamie Moore is a little bit different. Her voice is very strange, and it seems that Jamie Moore is crying.
	"Jamie Moore, what's the matter with you? Is there something bad happens to you? Or does someone bully you?" Wendy is in a hurry. There are only a few people in country C who can bully Jamie Moore. But her voice is strange. Is she really bullied by others?
	"Wendy..." Jamie Moore loses her mind when she hears the caring words of Wendy. Then she suddenly feels very bad, and she cries loudly.
	"Where are you now? I'll come to see you at once." Even though it’s working time, Wendy wants to find Jamie Moore immediately.
	Now Jamie Moore is in such a bad mood, and that means that something bad must happens to her.
	She has been a good friend of Jamie Moore for several years. Wendy thinks she knows Jamie Moore well. There is a kind of "telepathy" between her and Jamie. She is very sensitive to the thing happens to Jamie Moore.
	"I am..." Jamie Moore reports the address of the hospital to Wendy. She promises that she will stay in situ, thus she waits Wendy in downstairs of hospital.
	She squats down, and holds her knees with her arms. One could only see that her eyes are full of tears. She looks at the front unconsciously, and it seems that she is an abandoned dog.
	Wendy drives quickly. The company is not far from here, thus she arrives at the hospital in a few minutes. And then she finds that Jamie Moore squats on the side of street, thus she almost gets mad immediately.
	She walks to Jamie Moore, and pulls Jamie Moore to the car, and then she starts the engine, leaving here.
	Wendy takes Jamie Moore to her apartment. She hands a cup of warm water to her, and says, “Have a warm drink now."
	Jamie Moore looks very sad. Only that man in the Country C could make her like this.
	Jamie Moore holds the cup quietly. She drinks the water after hearing Wendy’s words. The warm water flows down to her throat, but she feels even colder.
	"Now you can tell me everything. What happened to you?" Wendy sits next to her and says softly.
	"He is cruel to me." After a few minutes, Jamie Moore murmurs, and her voice is full of grievance and sadness.
	Maybe even Jamie Moore herself doesn’t find the emotions in her words. But as a spectator, Wendy knows it clearly.
	Wendy is surprised. Is this because of the bad attitude of Dan William?
	"What happens?" Wendy asks. She thinks that Dan William always treats Jamie Moore so well. When he shows a bad attitude to Jamie Moore, Jamie Moore must do something bad or say something bad to him.
	We can't blame Wendy for thinking so. Wendy sees clearly the way that Dan William treats Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore confesses everything happened to Wendy, and she doesn’t hide everything. The more she says, the more aggrieved she is, and the more tears falls from her eyes.
	"Jamie." Wendy suddenly understands the reason why Dan William is so angry after hearing the words from Jamie Moore. It’s really for this stupid woman.
	She could say all these words to anyone, but she says all of these to Dan William.
	As for Dan William, her words have no difference from those of poison. Maybe Dan William is really hurts by these. Otherwise, he will not treat her like this.
	Thinking of this, Wendy even wants to poke Jamie Moore's head, and then breaks it off. If she hadn't known her for so long, she would really think that she wants to say those words sincerely.
	But she has known Jamie Moore for such a long time. Wendy knows that Jamie Moore is just an idiot. She is really an idiot in love!
	Wendy looks at Jamie Moore for one minute. The more she looks, the more suspicious she feels.
	Jamie Moore is so aggrieved…Does she love Dan William?
	Her eyes brightened in an instant. She throws the pillow in her arms, and then pulls out the pillow in Jamie Moore's arms. Seeing that Jamie Moore is in a trance, Wendy says what she thinks in her heart.
	"Now you care so much about the attitude of Dan William. Do you love him now?"
	In the past, Jamie Moore will deny this immediately.
	But now, she can't deny it. It's really funny.
	"Since you like him, why are you hesitating?" Wendy claps her hand, and she thinks that there is nothing between them.
Chapter 207 Ask for an Insult
	Since she loves him, there's nothing wrong with them.
	Jamie Moore takes a deep breath. She lowers her eyes, and there is a bitter smile on her face.
	"Jamie, maybe you could apologize to him, and he will forgive you." Wendy persuades her again.
	"No." Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then rubs her eyes with her hand. “I don’t want to ask for an insult. He doesn’t love me. It's useless even if I like him."
	Wendy is confused. Jamie is such a silly woman. How could he not love you?
	"Think about it. You say such a bad word to Dan William, which hurts him deeply. Even though he also says something bad to you, isn’t this for the word from you?"
	Jamie Moore lowers her head, and she looks stubborn. She knows that her words would hurt people.
	However, Dan William's words are more hurtful than hers, is she right?
	Wendy signs, and she could only persuade her to such a degree. If Jamie Moore continues like this, no one can do anything about it.
	…
	Jamie stays in Wendy's apartment for a few days. She doesn’t go to the hospital. The filming of Star is still in progress. When she needs to finish her work, she would go to the designated place to complete the filming task of that day.
	Ian Moore often comes to see her these days, but he doesn’t know that Dan William and Jamie Moore had quarreled with each other. He just thinks that Jamie Moore wants to live with Wendy, thus he doesn’t doubt this.
	This should thank to the tacit understanding of Dan William and Jamie Moore, and they also know that this kind of thing can't be discovered by Ian Moore.
	The filming continues for a month. In these days, sometimes Jamie Moore would be in a trance, and sometimes Jamie Moore would forget the action. Except this, the filming continues in a smooth way.
	In these days, Jamie Moore doesn’t go to the hospital, and she even doesn’t know the injury of Dan William. However, there are so many people taking care of him, and he would be OK.
	They are like strangers after that day.
	Jamie Moore is also gradually used to thinking of Dan William when she has nothing to do. Even when she is filming, she will take Ryan Jack as Dan William mistakenly...
	Today, Jamie Moore does not need to film for company, thus she stays at the department of Wendy. She eats the snacks of Wendy, and holds the beloved pillow of Wendy in her arms. She is watching micro blog.
	She finds this pillow from the internet, and then she sends it to Wendy. This pillow is as the same as a small cat. It's a long meow pillow. It's lovely and soft. No wonder that Wendy, who is a strong woman, loves it.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t stalk many people on micro blog. She knows most of people on her stalk list. Some of them are the colleagues of her in the UK, and some of them are friends and family, and some of them are the newly friend of her.
	Jamie Moore has owned lots of fans recently. All of this is for the filming these times.
	Jamie Moore also likes to send some self-portraits to Weibo. Usually, only her friends will comment under the Weibo, but this time, she finds there are hundreds of extra comments under the Weibo.
	It seems that this feeling is very good. She likes this feeling - Someone will care about her life.
	She stays at home for several days. Now, Jamie Moore, who always likes quiet, feels that it's good to have more people around her.
	The phone rings suddenly. It’s the call from Wendy.
	Jamie Moore looks at the screen, and then she puts the computer down. Then she answers the phone, and says with a smile, “Hello, Wendy, I told you that I own tens of thousands fans recently...”
	"Oh, my dear friend. Don’t pay attention to your fans. Have you received the invitation from the alumni association?" Wendy says hurriedly.
	It seems that she is on the car, because Jamie Moore could hear the sound of the car trumpet.
	"Invitation?" Jamie Moore is confused. Does she receive this invitation? She doesn’t know it.
	"Have you looked at your WeChat?" Wendy explains patiently.
	Jamie Moore feels embarrassed for a moment. Then she opens the WeChat on the computer. She doesn’t have many friends on WeChat. So what she receives is news and other push messages, or some several private messages.
	Then she finds that she really receives an invitation.
	She opens the email. She finds that there are date and some symbolic words on it.
	She finds that it’s the first time for them to hold the Alumni Association.
	“Have you seen it?”
	"I see it. It’s on the Friday night, and it’s hold in the Garden?" Jamie Moore looks at the invitation for several times, and then she blinks.
	"You don't have to film for promotional films tomorrow. Let's go to the invitation together tomorrow." It seems that Wendy is very excited about this.
	"Do you interest in such a thing? Don't you hate this kind of party the most?" Jamie Moore asks in disbelief.
	"It's hard for us to organize an alumni party. Of course we should go there!" Wendy says in a shy way. "Besides, will he go..."
	He refers to Duke Filed
	Jamie Moore signs lightly. Wendy is an outgoing girl. But when she meets Duke Field, she changes into another people.
	But then she reminds suddenly that if Duke Field goes to the invitation, it means Dan William will also go to invitation. Will they meet each other?
	Jamie Moore is not ready to meet with Dan William. So she doesn’t want to see him now.
	She is afraid that Dan William will say something bad to her again.
	"Wendy, will he go that day?” Jamie Moore hesitates for a moment, and then she asks.
	After thinking for a while, Wendy says, “No, I heard that he has gone on a business trip and he will not come back for the time being."
	He just leaves the hospital. Does he go on a business trip immediately?
	Jamie Moore worries about it. But she signs when she hears that Dan William doesn’t go to the invitation. At the same time, she is a little sad.
	-
	In the evening of the Friday, Jamie Moore cancels the filming with the Star. Because the two companies need to cooperate with each other, thus they will not force her to do something. So they allow postponing the filming quickly.
	It’s Friday. So they finish work early. Wendy returns to the apartment quickly, and then she takes Jamie Moore to choose clothes.
	After changing clothes, the two girls go to the Alumni Association immediately.
	They go by car, but there are a lot of cars on the street at this time. Fortunately, they leave home half an hour earlier, or they could not arrive at the appointed time.
	In the Garden.
	Wendy and Jamie Moore walks into the Garden according to the address on the invitation. They refuse the help of the waiter. Jamie Moore has come to this place for several times, so they don’t need the help from waiter.
	Soon they find the place where the party is.
	It's in a box of the center of the Garden. It's very quiet, and there are many unnamed flowers in the box. So when they enter the box, they could smell the fragrance of the flower.
Chapter 208 Truth or Dare
	Wendy and Jamie Moore open the door of the box, and they find there already has some people in it.
	They are all the classmates of them.
	"Jamie Moore, Wendy, come here to talk with us.” Seeing Jamie Moore and Wendy walks into the room, a girl asks them to sit beside her.
	Wendy looks around at the box. She is a little sad when she doesn’t find the figure of Duke Field.
	Jamie Moore pulls her to the table, and then sits down.
	"It's a shame that there are still someone come late." The man next to the girl looks at the number of people in the box, and then he complains.
	It is the sponsor of the Alumni Association. Jamie Moore remembers that his name is Barton Bob, who is the former senior.
	Some of them are from the same class as Jamie Moore, and many of them are senior schoolmates. Because they all have a good relationship, thus they all receive the invitation.
	"Maybe everybody is very busy. They all make time to come here.” A man besides Barton Bob says with a smile.
	"There are still some people leaves. Let’s wait for a moment.” The girl sitting next to Jamie Moore says.
	They haven’t seen each other for so long time. Now Jamie Moore could find the difference of those people.
	For her, the alumni party is nothing, and she would not come here if Wendy doesn’t want to go here.
	She keeps silent, and she drinks juice quietly.
	After a while, a sound of footsteps comes from the outside, and then the door is opened.
	Jamie Moore sits in the door of the box. When she hears the sound, she doesn’t turns around. Instead, she puts the crystal cup on her lap and presses her lips.
	The box becomes quiet because of the arrival of these people. Jamie Moore hears the surprising voice of people around her, and it seems that they have seen some unbelievable things.
	Jamie Moore turns around to look at Wendy, and then she finds that Wendy looks at the front with surprise. Her eyes are bright, and she almost has saliva on the corner of her lips.
	Seeing this, Jamie Moore suddenly reminds of something. She looks up, and then she almost loses her breath.
	At the gate of the box, Dan William wears a black suit vest, inside of which is a black shirt. It’s rare for Jamie Moore to see him wearing a suit vest, thus she is in a daze for a while.
	Jamie Moore turns her eyes. She shivers when she finds Dan William walks in with July Summer beside him. Fortunately, there is not much juice in the cup, or it would spill out.
	Wendy also finds Dan William comes in with July Summer beside him. She withdraws her eyes from Duke Field, and then she looks at Jamie Moore worriedly.
	She really doesn't know that Dan William would come. If she knows that he would come here, and he even comes here with a woman, she would never let Jamie Moore come with her.
	The shock in Jamie Moore’s face only keeps for a few seconds, and then she returns to normal. It seems that nothing has happened.
	Because Jamie Moore is in such a mood, thus Wendy worries about her so much.
	It would be OK if Jamie Moore doesn’t like Dan William. But now she loves Dan William, so she must mind this. What’s more, they just quarrel with each other, so it would be worse.
	Dan William and July Summer sit opposite Jamie Moore. There is still a seat beside Wendy, thus Duke Field and Bruce Hill walks to that seat.
	Wendy’s heart jumps heavily when Duke Field walks close to her.
	"Jamie Moore." Bruce Hill wants to sit beside Duke Field. But when he finds Jamie Moore sits beside Wendy, he walks to the seat beside Jamie Moore.
	“Can I sit here?” Bruce Hill says with a smile.
	There are only a few girls present, and some of them have married. But there are still a few single women. The girl who sits beside Jamie Moore is a single person. How could she bear this?
	She gives her seat to Bruce Hill without any consideration.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. Then she picks up the glass to drink juice. She tries all her effort to sallow the unspeakable weirdness in her throat.
	She doesn’t want to raise her head. She doesn’t want to see Dan William and July Summer who sits opposite her.
	He even brings outsiders to the Alumni Association, and only Dan William will do this. Jamie Moore feels a little sad after seeing this.
	All people arrive at the place soon. However, Jamie Moore is immersed in her own world, and she does not integrate into the atmosphere. Other people decide to play some games to activate the atmosphere.
	What they played is Truth or Dare. Although it sounds boring, in fact, it’s interesting. They even play another game before this game, but Jamie Moore can’t follow them. Wendy just pulls her mind back before this game starts. She reminds her to look at the wine bottle on the table.
	Compared with other people, Jamie Moore is a little absent-minded. In order not to let everyone disappointed, she tries all her effort to plat the game.
	Even Bruce Hill finds that there is something wrong between Jamie Moore and Dan William. Thus he doesn’t force Jamie Moore to say hello to Dan William, and he doesn’t ask Jamie Moore to improve the sense of existence all the time.
	Jamie Moore holds the crystal cup in her hands all the time. There is a layer of sweat in her hands, and her heart jumps heavily. She feels she is more nervous than usual, maybe this is because Dan William sits opposite her.
	When the wine bottle stops, she looks at Dan William unconsciously. But Dan William doesn’t look at her, and he never looks at her for a moment. He holds a glass of wine and tastes it leisurely.
	Jamie Moore is a little stuffy. She feels very uncomfortable as if she is blocked by a wad of cotton. She feels very uncomfortable.
	What's more, Dan William never says the words “I love you” to her. She still remembers what he said to her that day. Even though she stands in front of him barely, she is not different from those women outside...
	Jamie Moore pulls her minds back when she finds someone pulls her. She turns around, and then she finds Wendy is smiling at her.
	Her hearts jumps. Then she looks at the table following the eyesight of Wendy. Then she finds the round mouth of the bottle is pointing at her.
	What?
	Jamie Moore is a little confused. It’s obvious that she can’t follow the mind of other people. Now she looks silly and cute. She doesn’t wear any mark-up. Her eyes are clear and bright, and it seems that her eyes are full of charming. She doesn’t do this deliberately it, and she looks very beautiful now.
	All man presented here wants to know more about Jamie Moore.
	Wendy signs when she looks at the reaction of those man and Jamie Moore. Only Jamie Moore doesn’t know how charming she is now.
	"Cough," Barton Bob coughs for a few times. He reminds other people that it’s not good to staring at a girl like this. Then he looks at Jamie Moore and says with a smile, “Jamie Moore, it’s your turn now. Truth or Dare, you can choose one."
	Jamie Moore suddenly knows what they are playing. She tilts her head, and then says, "Truth."
	The eyes of those men brighten suddenly. Another man asks before Barton Bob say something, “Is Jamie Moore still single?"
	"Yes." Jamie Moore nods without hesitation.
	Hearing this, those men all rekindles the fire of hope.
	Jamie Moore is recognized as the most beautiful girl when she is in high school. At that time, all the boys who want to stay with her could circle around the campus.
Chapter 209 Do You Love Someone
	All single boys present here love Jamie Moore when they were in high school. Now the goddess is in front of THEM. Who can resist this adoration?
	“Do you love someone?” A man asks hurriedly.
	Jamie Moore's breath is sluggish, and she looks at the direction of Dan William unconsciously. But she finds that Dan William is touching the hair of July Summer. He lifts the hair hanging from July Summer's cheek to the back of her ear. He does this in an intimate way, and it seems that they are lovers.
	What about her?
	Jamie Moore holds the wine glass tightly. If there is no Ian Moore, he will never let her to enter the manor, and he will not treat her so well.
	"Yes." She replies frankly, but she looks at the person who asks this question..
	The answer sounds like a thunderbolt among those people.
	Dan William holds the wine glass tightly. His eyes are dark, and no one could know his mood.
	Seeing this, Bruce Hill is very excited. In his eyes, Jamie Moore and Dan William even have a child, so they must love each other. What’s more, Dan William treats Jamie Moore very well. Who does she like except Dan William?
	Wendy also finds there is something wrong. Then she asks, “How could you love him?"
	Jamie Moore frowns and thinks. Is it because Dan William treats her so well? Or does she like the hug from Dan William? Or is it because he will always stay around her when she is in danger?
	"Because he is gentle, and his arms are very warm." Jamie Moore says seriously. These are the two places that attract her most. She feels much secured.
	She will not worry about anything when she is held by his big hands.
	Dan William holds his hand tightly. And his eyes are full of anger. Gentle? Warm?
	What appears in his mind is the picture of Ryan Jack and Jamie Moore. He always treats Jamie Moore in a gentle way.
	Does she love him?
	Dan William feels cold in his heart. He drinks the wine in his glass, and it seems that he is hiding something.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field looks at Dan William. They never think that Dan William has such a gentle and tender side. Now Jamie Moore is in such a love relationship.
	"And who do you like?" Finally someone asks the question that everyone expected.
	However, Jamie Moore nods, and says with a smile, “This is another question, am I right?”
	The eyes of other people become dim. It's a pity for them to miss this opportunity.
	But they still have opportunities. They believe that they will get the answer they want.
	The game continues. The wine glass stops at the position of Wendy. She finally chooses Dare.
	The Dare - She should sing Little Apple with a man presented here.
	Jamie Moore laughs when she hears this idea. Because Wendy chooses Duke Field to sing with her. She can’t imagine Duke Field, who is always a cold man, sings this divine song.
	It’s lucky that Duke Field doesn’t refuse to sing with her. Instead, he stands up to sing with her.
	When they finish the song, the infatuation and intoxication of Wendy's eyes fades completely. No one finds she likes Duke Field, and Duke Field also doesn’t find this.
	Wendy always keeps calm. If she hadn't told Jamie Moore that she loves Duke Field, Jamie Moore will never know that she loves Duke Field.
	Wendy walks to Jamie Moore. There is no expression on her face. She sits with Jamie Moore calmly.
	When the bottle is about to point at Jamie Moore, the bottle suddenly turns around, and then the bottle points at Dan William.
	The smile of Bruce Hill is just like a cute cat. He looks at Dan William with smile. But when he finds the coldness in Dan William’s eyes, he almost loses his action. It’s lucky that he holds it steadily.
	He thinks that he sits beside Jamie Moore, thus Dan William will do nothing to him.
	This is why he wants to sit beside Jamie Moore.
	But Bruce Hill doesn’t know that he will be killed badly.
	"I will ask the question! Let me ask! Is the people you love here?" Bruce Hill asks quickly.
	Dan William looks at Bruce Hill, who has an expectant expression, “Do you want to know this?”
	Bruce Hill shivers...
	There are sweats on his back. He dares not to look at the eyes of Dan William. He shouldn’t ask this question. Everything is gone!
	"We also want to know this. Would Mr. Dan mind this?" Barton Bob finds there is something wrong, thus he comes to rescue.
	"Of course not." Dan William opens his mouth, and then he says coldly, “Of course, she is here.”
	Jamie Moore feels sad. She looks at July Summer who always keeps a smile on her face since she walks into the room. She is confused. Does he love this kind of girl?
	Wendy minds Jamie Moore for several times, but Jamie Moore doesn’t aware this. Instead, she lowers her head, and no one knows her thinking. She feels that Dan William is so miserable.
	Those people immediately rule the married people out, leaving only a few single girls and Jamie Moore, and July Summer beside Dan William.
	For a while, no one could guess the woman in Dan William’s mouth.
	Only Dan William knows the answer.
	Dan William gently shakes the liquid in the glass, and he has changed another cup of wine. What in the glass now is golden liquid. Under the dim light, it makes people feel a little dry in the throat.
	Jamie Moore licks her lips unconsciously, and then she drinks juice in the glass.
	She doesn’t know how charming she is in the eyes of other people.
	"Who does Mr. William like?" Finally, someone ask what Bruce Hill wants to ask. Thus Bruce Hill relieves. In this way, will he not die too badly?
	Even Jamie Moore also worries about this. Even though, he says such bad words to her that day, she still wants to know whether that person could be her.
	"The answer is obvious, am I right? Dan William does not answer them, but he asks. He still holds the glass in his hand with the same posture. His eyes are very dark, and no one dares to look into his eyes directly.
	Even though they want to know the person in Dan William’s mouth, they dare not to ask him.
Chapter 210 If You Are Ill, You Should Go to the Hospital
	Is it obvious?
	Does he mean the Miss beside him?
	Jamie Moore holds the cup tightly. And the smile on the corners of her mouth is a little bitter.
	"Come on. Don't worry. Let's go on." Seeing that the atmosphere is wrong, Barton Bob comes to rescue immediately.
	Maybe someone want to ask Jamie Moore question, thus it’s the third time that the wine glass stops at the front of Jamie Moore. She chooses Truth, and she answers some small questions.
	But at the end part of the game, the game becomes to drink wine. If the wine bottle stops in front of somebody, this person should drink three bottles of wine.
	"Jamie Moore, you have such a good drinking capacity.” Someone says. After drinking three bottles of wine, Jamie Moore’s face turns red, and now she is very attractive.
	But later, someone helps Jamie Moore secretly. When the wine bottle is about to stop in front of Jamie Moore, the bottle will turns around at the last second every time.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t have a good drinking capacity, and the drinking capacity of her is just poor. She still has some consciousness after drinking several cups of wine. She feels a little hot. The temperature on her face and the smell of smoke and wine in the box makes her very uncomfortable.
	She stands up, and she is ready to bathroom after saying goodbye to others.
	There is a separated bathroom in the box of the Garden. Jamie Moore doesn't want to stay in the box, so she takes an excuse to come out for fresh air.
	Jamie Moore comes out of the bathroom, and there is still water on her hands. She keeps patting her face to wake herself up.
	But this is useless. Thus she walks to the railing, and she wants to blow the wind.
	"Jamie Moore?" A voice breaks this beautiful picture. Jamie Moore opens her eyes. She drinks wines just now, and now she looks very charming, which could attract other people.
	She turns around, and then she finds it’s a man in the box. After thinking for a while, Jamie Moore finally remembers the name of this man.
	Colin is the chairman of the student union when he is in school. He has a good family background and he is handsome, bur he is a male chauvinism.
	"What’s the matter?” Jamie Moore looks at him politely, and then she asks.
	"Be my girlfriend." Colin says directly. He raises his chin, and he looks very proud, as if he is sure that Jamie Moore would agree this.
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become cold, and then she looks at Colin, “Haven’t you take medicine?”
	Colin is choked. Then he realizes that Jamie Moore is scolding him, thus his face turns blue.
	In his eyes, Even Jamie Moore is beautiful, she is just a woman. It’s lucky for her to be his girlfriend. How could she do this?
	"Yes or No? You’d better follow me." Colin says in a force way.
	Jamie Moore almost laughs. Is this this too silly?
	She rolls her eyes, “If you are ill, you should go to the hospital!”
	Colin holds the arms of Jamie Moore, and his face is very dark. It seems that he is saying that Jamie Moore doesn’t know good or bad. The words he utters are even worse. "You're just a woman. Why are you so proud here? It’s lucky for you to be my girlfriend!"
	Jamie Moore sneers, and she looks at Colin who holds her hand tightly. Then she says in an impatient way, “Have you kicked by an ass? Let me go!"
	"What can you do?" Colin is not polite any more. He puts his hand on Jamie Moore's delicate face and wipes it. The greasy touch immediately makes his mind ripple. Then he looks at a pair of hot eyes.
	Jamie Moore is the goddess in the eyes of most boys in the school. Everyone will be attracted by this delicate face. If Jamie Moore becomes his woman, it would be a good thing for him...
	Colin has a good calculation in his mind. He looks at Jamie Moore as if Jamie Moore doesn’t wear any clothes, which is very disgusting.
	Jamie Moore feels very disgust when she thinks the eyesight of Colin. She throws away his hand heavily. Maybe she drinks too much alcohol, thus her strength is much smaller than before. It seems that she acts as playing hard to get.
	Colin looks around, and then he kisses heavily on the neck of Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore weaves her head to deviate the touch from Colin. She is in a hurry, thus she raises her leg to kick the lower part of the body of Colin.
	Her strength was much smaller than usual, but the lethality is still there. Colin lets Jamie Moore go suddenly for the kick from Jamie Moore, thus he bends down painfully.
	Jamie Moore is afraid. She looks like a frightened fawn, and runs forward quickly. She dares not to look back, and she just runs forward.
	"Bitch!" the expression of Colin is not very good. He chases up without caring about the pain on his lower part of body. He catches up Jamie Moore in a few steps.
	Jamie Moore is held by him. He holds her in a strong strength, and she feels that her arms have broken, thus she frowns.
	Jamie Moore feels a little dizzy. She looks at Colin who walks closer to her in a frightening way, and she is very afraid.
	She clenches her teeth, and then she bites on the hand of Colin heavily!
	"Ah!" Colin throws her away for pain. Jamie Moore falls on the ground for the action of Colin. She holds her body by putting her hand on the ground.
	"Bitch! Do you want to die?" Colin walks to Jamie Moore. He grabs Jamie Moore in a rude way, thus Jamie Moore feels very painful.
	He raises his hand, and then he slaps on the face of the beautiful face of Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes. She knows that she can’t dodge this, thus she doesn’t dodge anymore.
	She feels sad in her heart.
	Dan William should still be in the box now. Does he still hold the beauty in his arms? Maybe he still doesn’t find that she is not in the room. How could he find her now?
	She has given up struggling, and she is waiting for the slap.
	She doesn’t feel pain on her face a few minutes later. What’s the matter?
	Jamie Moore is confused, and then she opens her eyes slowly. Then she finds Colin falls on the ground.
	He looks very funny now, and he loses all his pride now.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. She raises her head, and then she finds a shadow in front of her. She is wrapped in the fragrance of mint. Thus her heart jumps unconsciously.
	"Who gives you the courage to make trouble with her in front of me?" The cold voice sounds. The voice is full of anger. Jamie Moore keeps calm, and then finally she sees the appearance of the man.
	Dan William.
	It’s Dan William.
	The sour and astringent in Jamie Moore’s heart suddenly surged towards the tip of the nose and the eyes. It’s sour and astringent. She dares not to blink her eyes. She is afraid that tears in her eyes will fall down if she blinks her eyes.
	How could he come out suddenly?
	"Ahhh! Mr. William, I'm wrong. I'm wrong. I promise I won't make trouble with her again!" Colin squats down on the ground for pain. Now he is embarrassed and dirty. Dan William kicks him heavily. He uses all his strength to kick Colin.
	
Chapter 211 He Can’t Bear This
	"Next time?" Dan William's eyes become dark gradually. He narrows his eyes dangerously. Before Colin could finish his word for mercy, Dan William steps forward and walks to Colin. The every step of her is full of anger, but there is a smile on the corner of his mouth.
	The atmosphere around him is very cold. But he looks very dangerous now. He walks to Colin, and then he steps on the back of his hand heavily!
	"Ah!" Colin is so painful that he can’t say anything.
	He knows that Dan William has many ways to kill him, even if he doesn’t kill him by himself. What’s more, now he does this by himself.
	"Do you want to slap her just now?” Dan William says in a cold way. He doesn’t move his shoes from the hand of Colin; instead, he steps even harder than before.
	Colin is crying, and he dares not to say anything. Now every minute and second is a kind of suffering for him.
	"Good, it’s very good.” Dan William presses his lips. His eyes are very dark. A storm flow in his eyes, as if it would break out in the next moment.
	"Dan William..." Jamie Moore murmurs. Although she drinks so much just now, her wet eyes are full of fear.
	Dan William loses his mind for the murmur of Jamie Moore. He turns around, and then he sees the wet eyes of Jamie Moore.
	Dan William holds his hands tightly, and then he says, “Derek William, take him out."
	Dan William shows his meaning with those few words. Derek William walks out from the dark, and then he walks to the front of Colin. He takes him away under the frightened eyes of Colin.
	One could predict the fate of Colin.
	It doesn't matter for Dan William. As long as someone dares to hurt Jamie Moore, he must let this people to pay the price and life for this!
	Let alone this man wants to do something bad to Jamie Moore, what’s more, he even wants to beat her, this is what Dan William can’t bear most.
	However, this is not what makes Dan William feel embarrassed.
	It's him.
	He rolls His eyes, and then he turns around. He walks forward without looking at Jamie Moore who stands there alone.
	Jamie Moore is surprised. She reaches out to hold his clothes.
	Dan William stops, and then he looks at her coldly. There is no expression on his face. It seems that he is looking at an unimportant person. “What’s the matter?”
	Jamie Moore bites her lips, and she grabs his clothes in a bewilder way. She wants to say something, but she doesn’t know how to start the conversation. She looks a little dull at the moment.
	It’s obvious that the cold attitude of Dan William hurt her. She feels uncomfortable, and she doesn’t want to let her go like this.
	She is worried at a moment.
	"Dan William~" July Summer walks toward them from the corridor. She wears high-heeled shoes, and leaves a string of clear clattering on the floor. Besides, there is a bright smile on her face.
	Dan William looks at the direction of July Summer. Then his face becomes soft. Then he reaches out to get rid of Jamie Moore’s hand. Then he walks toward July Summer in a good mood.
	Jamie Moore realizes the action of Dan William. She wants to hold it tightly, but she can’t hold anything.
	July Summer holds the arm of Dan William naturally. She looks at Jamie Moore, and she finds the light on Jamie Moore’s eyes disappears. She finds Jamie Moore just looks at the back of Dan William gloomily.
	July Summer smiles happily.
	So that is what it is.
	Jamie Moore just looks at the leaving back of Dan William and July Summer. The tears appear in her eyes, and then fall down from her eyes. The tears fall down on the ground quietly.
	What she wants to says is - Dan William, I love you.
	But she dares not to say these words. She is hurt by the attitude of Dan William that day and today.
	Sure enough, he hates her now, is she right?
	Jamie Moore forgets the time she returns back to the box. After returning back to the seat, she looks at the position of Dan William unconsciously. There is no one on that seat.
	"They haven't left, and they just haven't come back." Wendy explains when she finds Jamie Moore looks at the position of Dan William in a daze.
	"What happened just now? Who hurt you just now? Wendy finds the scratch on Jamie Moore's hand, and she frowns. Is this caused by Dan William?
	It’s impossible. Why did he do it?
	"It's OK. It's just a small scar." Jamie Moore doesn’t look at her wrist. It’s nothing, and it’s not painful at all. But her heart is very painful at the moment.
	She feels that she is really getting less and less promising.
	Only the indifferent eyes of Dan William can make her like this. Can she have more brave?
	Wendy just sings a song "little apple" with Duke Field. She is not interested in these things now, but she worries about Jamie Moore.
	The door of the box opens again, and then Dan William and July Summer walk into the box.
	Just now, they leave earlier than Jamie Moore, but they come back later than Jamie Moore. What did they do just now...?
	Jamie Moore is in a daze, and she just looks at the direction of Bruce Hill unconsciously.
	Bruce Hill sits beside Jamie Moore, and he is drinking wine.
	He suddenly sees Dan William and Jamie Moore who have come back to the box. He rolls his eyes, and then he has an idea in his heart.
	He takes the microphone out of the man's hand without any pause. He puts the glass down, and then walks to Jamie Moore.
	"Little Jamie, I haven't heard you sing for a long time. Would you like to sing one?" Then he hands the microphone to her.
	Jamie Moore is shocked, and she doesn’t know what Bruce Hill wants to do. Bruce Hill takes the lead in putting the microphone into her hand, and then he pulls Jamie More to the stage.
	"Brother, will you sing with Jamie Moore?” Bruce Hill hands another microphone to Dan William, and he laughs treacherously.
	Jamie Moore holds the microphone in her hand tightly. Then she looks at Dan William with some expectation.
	Bruce Hill thinks that Dan William will pick the microphone, but instead, Dan William glances at Jamie Moore, and then she looks at Bruce Hill, “I have no interest in this.”
	What?
	Hearing Dan William’s word, Bruce Hill and Duke Field is all shocked.
	Does Dan William refuse to sing with Jamie Moore?
	What happened between these two people? Did they quarrel with each other?
	Jamie Moore’s face turns white. She just stands there. All people looks at her with doubtful, ridicule and gloating eyes, thus she feels very embarrassed.
	Wendy worries about Jamie Moore more. Does Dan William want to stay away with Jamie Moore?
	It's no wonder that Jamie Moore is in such a mood. Now it seems that all of this is for Dan William.
	Seeing Dan William’s action, Wendy stands up, and she wants to take the microphone.
	"Please order a song “what a pity” for me." Jamie Moore says to the person who is standing next to the screen. She wears a smile on her face. If her eyes don’t turn red, the effect will be better.
	Wendy stops, and then she sees Jamie Moore give a sight meaning “don’t worry” to her. Thus she sits down again.
	The familiar melody rings in the box. Jamie Moore stands in front of the screen. The light on the screen envelops her like a flower fire.
Chapter 212 Sell Her Friend for the Man She Loved
	Wendy knows this song, and she also knows that Jamie Moore loves this song. She has heard Jamie Moore humming the melody of this song for many times, and the ring of her mobile phone is also this song.
	Although Ian Moore will change the ring of Jamie Moore's cell phone, Jamie Moore loves this song very much.
	“It’s not easy to forget you
	It’s doesn’t your fault, and I am so vulnerable
	The love between us is as deep as the sea
	No one could compare with you
	You never put this in your eyes
	I am not missing you for loneliness
	It’s true that there is love between us, and I don’t cheat you
	I will stand by you even if the whole world is against you
	I suffer grievance for you
	But I am willing to suffer these sufferings
	What a pity! I lose you
	I’m sorry, and I try all my effort
	I never give up, and I just don’t want to see you
	In this way, I will not hurt myself
	What a pity! We can’t go back to the past
	I am sad, and I am crying
	I refuse the love from other people
	I am just waiting for you...”
	The sad voice of Jamie Moore resounds in the box, and the song of Jamie Moore even could pierce the heart of the people presented.
	Dan William leans against the soft sofa, and he closes his eyes slightly. It seems that there is light flow in his eyes. He puts his fingers on his legs. He kicks with the rhythm of the music and song, and no one knows what he is thinking.
	He could see himself through this song.
	“Snap" The voice is neither big nor small, but it could stop the song of Jamie Moore.
	It’s a broken sound of wine bottle. The song stops at the moment, and the eyesight of Jamie Moore is caught by this. She stops singing immediately.
	She looks at the direction of the sound consciously.
	Dan William glances at the people who look at him, and then he says lightly, “Slide.”
	All people nod, and then they withdraw their eyesight. Then they continue to hear the song of Jamie Moore.
	But now Jamie Moore doesn’t want to sing song. The original singer on the screen behind her is about to finish singing this song. She doesn't think it's necessary to sing this song any more. So she hands the microphone to others and goes back to her position.
	She thinks that Dan William did this intentionally
	Thinking of here, she raises her head to look at Dan William. Dan William just sits there, and he holds a glass on his hand. The atmosphere around him is very cold. It seems that he doesn’t care anything.
	…
	When the party goes to an end, all people say goodbye to each other for a long time.
	Dan William leaves with July Summer in his arms. When they walks in front of Jamie Moore and Wendy, Jamie Moore frowns for the strong smell on the body of July Summer.
	She rubs her small nose, and then looks at the leaving backs of Dan William and July Summer. She doesn’t want to see this.
	There is a cunning light in Jamie Moore’s eyes, and then she suddenly reminds of something, thus she smiles.
	"Wendy, I'm going to do a great job. You go home first. Don't wait for me." Jamie Moore catches the step of Dan William as she says. And soon the figure of Jamie Moore disappeared.
	"You are such a woman who will leave friend alone for the man you loved.” Wendy murmurs.
	Maybe Ian Moore will have a little sister soon...
	Duke Field and Bruce Hill walks out together. Seeing this, Wendy follows them.
	She also has her own "great plan".
	Jamie Moore follows Dan William, but she doesn't see them leave the garden. Instead, he goes to the hotel of the garden. Even fools know what they want to do!
	Sleep in the hotel!
	Jamie Moore’s face turns white, and she bits her lips tightly. Now she looks very pitiful and sad.
	Follow or not?
	If Dan William finds her, what will happen?
	She is so worried that she couldn't care about anything, so she follows Dan William quickly.
	When Jamie Moore walks into the hostel, Dan William has completed the formalities and walks towards the elevator. Jamie Moore takes out her ID card from her bag, and completes the formalities. She walks to the elevator with card and key in her hand. She looks at the rising number, and then she walks to the other side of the elevator and presses a string of numbers.
	At the moment, Jamie Moore doesn’t have any worry in her mind. What she thinks is what Dan William and July Summer will do in the room. Will he do something bad to July Summer. Do they fall in love with each other?
	Ding…
	As soon as the door of the elevator opens, Jamie Moore walks out immediately. It’s true that she sees the figure of Dan William.
	They stay with each other closely.
	She loves the hug of him. But now he holds another woman in his arms。
	Jamie Moore hesitates for a while when she walks out of the elevator. There is some confusion in her eyes. And the scene that Dan William treats her coldly appeared in her mind, thus she hesitates.
	No, no, Jamie Moore. You are a fool. If they make love, you will never be with him in your whole life!
	You will regret for a lifetime!
	The idea appears in Jamie Moore's mind, and she finally steps forward and runs to them first.
	At this time, Dan William has opened the door. He walks into the room with July Summer, and then he closes the door.
	"Wait..." Jamie Moore runs to the door. She wants to knock the door angrily. Fortunately, she holds back.
	At this moment, the uneasiness and fear magnifies in her heart, which made her realize clearly that she would be uneasy and afraid when she finds Dan William has intimate action with other women.
	Jamie Moore never has this feeling, thus she is shocked by this idea.
	However, she knows that she can't leave now. She must find a way to get Dan William out!
	She leans against the door, and she wants to hear something, but in fact, she can’t hear anything.
	Then she suddenly reminds that her room is next to their room.
	Why she can’t hear something even though she stays in the room beside them.
	Jamie Moore wants to turn herself into a bug and go into their room at the moment. She leans against the wall. There is only a wall between them, but she can’t hear anything.
	The phone rings suddenly. Jamie Moore sits on the cold ground of the room, and then she answers the phone with some frustration.
	"Jamie? Have you succeeded in acting your plan? Wendy sits in the car of Duke Field, thus she says in a low voice.
	She is so smart. She knows that Jamie Moore has caught Dan William. But she hesitates for a while, and then Dan William leaves away.
	"What's the plan?" Sure enough, Jamie Moore says in a stuffy way. It’s obvious that she doesn’t do her action smoothly.
	"You want to catch Dan William, am I right?"
	"He's in the room with that woman now; I just want to take him out..." Jamie Moore murmurs, and she slaps the hard wall a few times.
	Wendy rolls her eyes after hearing this, “You are such a fool!"
	The eyes of Jamie Moore brightened. The light appears on her face. Then she asks,” Wendy, Do you have any ideas?”
	Wendy rolls her eyes. It’s true that she has idea. But she should pay the price for this.
	"If you don't stop in time, your man will be gone! You are such a fool!"
	Hearing Jamie Moore’s words, Jamie Moore feels more uncomfortable. But she smiles when she hears “your man” from the mouth of Wendy.
	
Chapter 213 Why There Is a woman Here
	"Listen to me, you could drink some alcohol, and then..." Wendy tells her plan in detail to Jamie Moore.
	If Jamie Moore drinks too much alcohol, she will forget everything. Wendy knows this, thus she gives this idea to Jamie Moore.
	Wendy is very confident when she hangs up. If Jamie Moore does this, Dan William will listen to her well.
	Jamie Moore is aware of this, but as her best friend and an outsider of their love, Wendy knows this well.
	Miss Moore, don't worry. If Dan William throws you out, I'll pick you up and take you to our home now!
	"Why are you so happy?" Duke Field looks at her in a puzzled way.
	"Nothing, I just think it's a nice day, so I'm happy!" Wendy immediately changes her attitude, and then she looks at Duke Field with a smile.
	Duke Field looks at the dark sky...Is the weather nice?
	…
	In the room of the hotel, Jamie Moore cheers herself up, and then she stands up from the ground.
	The room is very big, but Jamie Moore doesn’t enjoy it. She had stayed in the hotel of the Garden for several times before. Thus she is familiar with the pattern here. She takes a bottle of wine, and opens the cork with the bottle opener.
	There is a strong smell of wine floating in the room. Jamie Moore is afraid that they would sleep together if she is late. Thus she drinks with the bottle directly.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t have a good drinking capacity. She feels dizzy after drinking wine in the box. But now she drinks a big bottle of vodka, and the degree of the alcohol is the same degree as white wine. It’s true that Jamie Moore will feel dizzy.
	Jamie Moore drinks half of the vodka. She feels very uncomfortable in her stomach. Her body is very hot, and she feels very uncomfortable.
	Jamie Moore still remembers what she needs to do after drinking alcohol. She has more courage than usual since she has drunk so much. She walks to the door unsteadily, and she touches the door for several times.
	She shivers her body, and then she walks to the door of Dan William. She forgets ring the doorbell, thus she slaps the door recklessly, "Dan William! Come out now!"
	Sure enough, one will become more brave if one drink alcohol!
	The voice resounds in the door. Soon, the door opens from inside. Dan William is not in a good mood, but he is shocked when he sees the woman outside.
	What appears in his eyes is the red face of Jamie Moore. She drinks too much alcohol, and he even could smell the smell of alcohol. Her eyes are full of light, and it is the light of charming, it’s so pure. Now she looks very attractive.
	"Um…You finally open the door." Jamie Moore wipes her face, and then she smiles at Dan William. Then she goes into the room before Dan William stops her.
	Jamie Moore walks in a messy way. She is very dizzy. He can only vaguely see a general picture in front of her. It seems that she really drinks too much.
	Dan William frowns. He doesn’t know what Jamie Moore wants to do, thus he closes the door and walks into the room
	"Why is a woman here?" Jamie Moore puffs up her cheeks angrily. She points at July Summer, who is drinking water on the sofa, with her fingers. Then she stares at Dan William.
	July Summer is surprised when she sees Jamie Moore. She puts down the cap, and her face is still pale.
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes, and then she presses her lips aggrievedly. Then she says, “Are you sleeping together just now?”
	Hearing Jamie Moore’s words, Dan William, who just walks into the door, is choked. What is the impure idea in Jamie Moore’s mind?
	July Summer feels embarrassed, and then she explains, "Miss Moore, you misunderstand me. I have a stomachache just now. Thus Dan William sends me here to have a rest."
	"Why explain this to her? It has nothing to do with her." Dan William walks in with his hands in his pocket. Then she looks at Jamie Moore coldly.
	"It has something to do with me!" Jamie Moore stares at him. She almost falls down on the ground unsteadily.
	Dan William walks forward quickly. He reaches out to pick her, and finally he holds Jamie Moore in his arms.
	He could smell the fragrance of alcohol and the fragrance of her body, and he is almost intoxicated by this.
	"Then I'll go first, and you can talk with each other now." July Summer picks the bag aside up. Then she stands up, and walks outside as she says.
	Dan William keeps calm. He withdraws his hand after helping Jamie Moore. Then he says to July Summer, “You are not feeling well, and I will give you a ride."
	July Summer wants to refuse, but she stops when she sees the aggrieved expression of Jamie Moore. Although Jamie Moore drinks too much, she knows that Jamie Moore doesn’t want Dan William to go.
	Thus she wants to make a joke with Jamie Moore suddenly. Then July Summer nods, “OK.”
	Then the two people walk to the door as they say.
	But Dan William stops moving after taking one step. He lowers his head, and then he looks at the hands on his arms. The light flashes in his eyes, and he is shocked.
	"You can’t leave now. If you walk forward, I will bite you!” Jamie Moore gnashes her teeth, and then she says badly behind Dan William. Dan William could feel the chest of Jamie Moore from his back, which ignites the desire of his body.
	Suddenly, his eyes become dark. The light rises in his eyes.
	July Summer leaves quietly, and she even closes the door for them.
	Dan William wants to turn around to look at Jamie Moore, but he finds Jamie Moore is hanging on his body like an octopus. She holds his body tightly, and she refuses to let Dan William go.
	"What do you want to do?" He says in a calm way, but his voice is full of helplessness.
	Huh?
	Jamie Moore is smart at this time. Suddenly, she reminds what she needs to do here. She still remembers the words of Wendy. She jumps down from his body. She wants to fling herself on the body of Dan William, but she falls down on the ground suddenly.
	Jamie Moore, who is very dizzy, is even dizzier for the fall. She sits on the ground in a daze. Now she looks very attractive. The light in her eyes almost could burn other people.
	Dan William signs, and he wants to pull her up. But Jamie Moore jumps to Dan William suddenly. Dan William has not prepared for this, thus Jamie Moore falls on his body suddenly.
	"Eat you, eat you..." Jamie Moore murmurs. She sits on the body of Dan William. What she thinks in her mind is having sex with Dan William.
	Dan William's body shivers suddenly. He looks at the hand on his chest. His body becomes hot, and it seems that there is electricity on his body.
	"What do you want to do?" Dan William looks at Jamie Moore who is touching his body. How much wine does this girl drink? How could she dare to allure him here?
	"Sleep with you!" Jamie Moore is much more honest after drinking. She will say everything in her mind. Thus when Dan William asks, she tells her idea to him immediately.
	Dan William is a little shocked. After a few seconds, he realizes what Jamie Moore says. This girl wants to...

Chapter 214 Is He Going to Find the Other Woman
	How will he not enjoy her since she has already takes initiatives? Dan is not a saint at all. It is good for him to be able to hold it for so long with Jamie's temptation.
	He rolls over and presses Jamie, who is sitting on him, under his body. His black eyes are excited, with a dazzling light; it seems that they can me melt broken ice.
	"What are you doing? Go down. It should be me who put you down..." Jamie is unhappy by being pressed by him. She pouts and her eyes seem to show her annoyance, which makes her seem to coquettish now.
	Dan's heart suddenly is moved and he can’t help but leans over, accurately catching her charming lips.
	"Hmm ..." Jamie is kissed in a dizzy status, trying to reach out to push him. But her body is so soft that it seems not belong to her, which makes her seem whether to refuse him or not.
	His mind ripples for a while. He just wants to continue the kiss. But he doesn’t expect Jamie to take the opportunity to turn over and press Dan under her again when Dan loses his mind.
	"Hey." She smiles happily and her eyebrows look very cute. She is a little coquettish and rakish, which makes him reluctant to move his sights away.
	"Don't be naughty. I'm going to press you down today!" She says and hiccups again. She is laughing and leans near Dan's ear, exhaling a light breath. The warm breath is flicking back and forth near his ear.
	Dan only feels that a stream of blood is rushing into his head, and he grunts uncomfortably. The corner of his lips makes an evil arc. The black eyes seem to see through her heart and keep looking at her, "Do you know what you are talking?”
	Jamie ignores his words. Covering by the hot heat, she feels that his shirt and skin are cool and she can’t help but approaching him a little bit.
	The small hand is also working that she pulls on him, trying to take his clothes off.
	"You ..." Dan is a little annoyed. When his concentration is so bad that he can’t control in front of her?
	"Don't speak! I can't untie it!" Jamie is anxious and unhappy when she can’t untie it. She looks like she is about to cry with her mouth pouting.
	"..." Dan doesn’t speak anymore, but Jamie keeps groping on him. What’s worse, she is wearing a dress today. And he can clearly feel the touch of her delicate skin.
	His clenched fist is loosened and clenched for several times. Jamie still can’t release his button. But he can’t bear it anymore. Then he turns over and gets up by holding Jamie. And he walks towards the inner room.
	Entering the inner room, he throws Jamie on the big bed and leans over to press her before she can react.
	"Do you want to put me down too?" Jamie looks at him with her hazy eyes, and can’t help licking the dry lips. She inadvertently reveals an inexplicable charm.
	Simply she is seducing him.
	Dan's eyes are dark and look excited. He leans over and kisses her lips again, licking and biting her lips carefully. He even wishes to swallow her down into the abdomen and shows his domineering power. So Jamie is hard to resist.
	Well, Wendy is right. He really likes to be put down by her!
	Thinking about it, Jamie obeys her wish and responds to his kiss awkwardly.
	There is an atmosphere floating in the room, which densely lingers around, making them unable to care about other thing.
	When they are about to do the last step, Dan stops.
	Jamie is stunned when she is kissed by him. She breathes softly with her small mouth open and her face flushes a little like a ripe cherry which tempts others to pick.
	Dan stares at her with complicated feelings for a while, and the roseate lips purses.
	She is drunk now. When she wakes up and finds that he has sex with her, will she be angry with him?
	He takes a few deep breaths and tries to restrain the constant heat and discomfort on his body. So he is about to escape away.
	Well?
	Jamie's eyes are dimly clear, and she opens her eyes vigorously to see the man in front of her. It’s Dan.
	It’s Dan who she likes.
	Why doesn't he continue? Is he going to find the other woman?
	Maybe Dan's bad attitude makes her feel nervous and makes Jamie's mind become clear when she is drunk.
	She purses her mouth in disapproval, grabbing a pillow to hit Dan.
	Dan doesn’t dodge or hide, letting the pillow slip from his head. He purses his thin lips and clenches his hands tightly, trying to calm himself down.
	"You take a rest first. I'll leave." He can't stay here any longer. If he goes on like this, there must be something wrong.
	After saying this, he turns around and strides out.
	Leave?
	There is a momentary blank in Jamie's head, and there is no grievance anymore. The rest is nervousness and anger.
	She takes a few steps towards Dan. She grabs his arm under his stunned eyes and takes a bite!
	She has a lot of energy and a bloody taste spreads in her mouth while Dan has no response.
	"What the hell do you want to do?" His voice seems to be impatient and helpless. Jamie hears this and her tears, which are accumulated in the whole evening, can’t help falling down.
	Her tears are falling on Dan's arm. His eyes wrinkle instantly. Watching Jamie who bites his arm, cries heavily and looks so poor, his heart softens.
	"Why are you crying?"
	It is like a warm sunshine in the snowy winter and it warms Jamie's heart instantly.
	"Are you going to find the other woman?"
	The voice is filled with unresolved grievances, mixed with some loneliness and sadness.
	Dan is surprised for a while. And he doesn’t figure out what Jamie means. The brain that usually works fast and accurate, is actually shutting down.
	If it’s not his narcissism, Jamie means that she thinks he is going to find the other woman. That’s the reason why she cries.
	In other words, is she jealous?
	Without waiting for him to digest the fact, Jamie drags him inwardly and murmurs with her small mouth, "Wendy says you are not good in sex now. It seems to be true. It does not matter. After tonight, you are mine and no one can take you away…"
	Dan, who hears this sentence, can’t help laughing. What does she mean by saying that?
	He raises his sharp eyebrows, watching at Jamie with his eyes with dangerous feelings. "Who do you mention? Who is not good in sex?"
	"You." The dizzy Jamie doesn’t know that the dangerous thing is coming. The drunkenness is really a bad thing that she can only tell the truth, not the lies.
	As expected, Dan's eyes become dark. He sees that she is smiling and the arc of his mouth also shows a chill. "Who is not good in sex? Hmm?"
	The last word is said in a heavy voice. When at the usual, Jamie can soon notice that he is not happy. But now that she is drunk, she is very fearless. How can she see the danger in his eyes?
	"You, you ..." Jamie looks at Dan. He approaches closer to her step by step. Not knowing why, she feels that she is in danger!
	
Chapter 215 You Are Mischievous
	She turns around and wants to run from the bed to the other side. However, Dan stretches out his hand and pulls her into his arms.
	"You are just mischievous. I will show you whether I am good in sex!"
	After saying that, he places Jamie in the middle of the bed and presses on her tightly.
	"Hmm ..." Jamie flinches suddenly. She has a hunch that she is over tonight.
	Jamie is fainted by the pain and she wakes up again. Seeing Dan, who is still not exhausted, she is a little scared and is afraid that she will die here tonight.
	But no matter how she begs for mercy, Dan uses the sentence to stop her, "Don't you want to see if I am good at sex? I'm satisfying your curiosity." It makes her want to die.
	What does it mean by saying “you lift a stone and hit your own feet”? That is it.
	She doesn’t know how many times they have sexes in the past seconds. Finally she is free. She doesn’t even want to lift her eyelids and falls asleep.
	Dan bows his head and kisses gently on her forehead. There is infinite love in his black eyes. He simply cleans her body and his own body. Then he puts her in his arms and falls asleep soon.
	…
	Early in the morning, when Dan opens his eyes, Jamie is still sleeping happily with a little cuteness on her small face. She has a quiet and lovely sleeping face, and her small mouth is pouting as if she wants kiss.
	Dan puts his hands behind his head to support the back of his head. He doesn’t move and looks at Jamie's sleeping face. His heart seems to be filled and feels moved.
	A burst of cell phone ringing suddenly turns out and it sounds very weird.
	Dan's eyes flickers slightly. He reaches out for the mobile phone on the table and makes his movements lightly. He walks to the French window to answer the phone.
	"Hello?"
	It’s unknown that what is said on the phone, while Dan's complexion suddenly changes. His responds in a low voice and then says to hang up.
	He walks into the bathroom to wash himself. After seeing that Jamie has not awaken and is still sleeping happily. He takes out the paper and pen from the drawer and writes a few words on it. Then he puts it beside her hand. And he kisses her forehead and takes the blazer to go out.
	The room is quiet.
	The clock on the wall has slowly climbed towards four o'clock in the afternoon. Jamie, who is sleeping on the bed, slowly wakes up.
	Sunlight comes in from the window, and the golden shine falls on the smooth floor, which shines the rooms.
	Jamie opens her eyelids slowly with bloodshot in her shining eyes. Her pink lips are slightly swollen, which looks particularly attractive.
	When she moves her body slightly, she feels as if she has been disassembled and reorganized. Every pore is feeling soreness and fatigue. And it is terrible for her to move a finger.
	"What's going on?" Jamie feels that her head is a little dizzy. There is no pain or discomfort. It is probably because of her different physique. No matter what alcohol she drinks, she will not have a hangover. But the next day she will be dizzy.
	What happens?
	Her brain works quickly to think about desperately who he is last night.
	Dan?
	It seems that he is probably the man!
	Jamie reaches out and knocks her head annoyingly. Her body falls backwards and she tightly wraps herself around with the quilt. She only exposes her small head. She is a little annoyed, a little sweet and she has complicated feelings.
	Suddenly, her eyes fall on the sticky note, "I have something to solve and I need to leave. Go back to the manor and wait for me!"
	Jamie looks at the words and hits it with dissatisfaction. A scene suddenly appears in her mind. She puts Dan down and reaches out to take off his clothes...
	Thinking of the scene last night, Jamie feels that her small face is burned by a fire. Her face feels so hot that she feels shy to meet Dan again.
	After a while, she gets out of the bed and walks towards the bathroom.
	After bathing, Jamie feels that her whole person is a lot more comfortable. The discomfort of the legs is still there, and the calves are a little trembling. But they are all held up by her struggling efforts. She insults the energetic man in her heart!
	She ran into the room because she was drunk last night. Her things are still in the next door. After looking at the room, she closes the door and goes to the next door. Fortunately, the things have not been cleared away.
	She takes things away and checks out. Then she leaves.
	Jamie is bashful although she has thick skin at this moment. How can it be possible for her to go back to the manor obediently? She stops a taxi and leaves after saying the location of Wendy's apartment.
	Back to the apartment, Jamie walks to the door with some weak steps and scolds Dan angrily while holding the key to open the door.
	The door opens and Jamie is about to step in. But she is scared to tremble by a figure at the entrance.
	"Ah!" She shouts and is almost scared to fall back. But fortunately she stabilizes her body in time.
	The security here is always good and there should not be a thief.
	Jamie glances at it and finds that Wendy is lying on the ground!
	"Wendy, Wendy. Why are you sleeping on the floor?" Jamie squats down with a smile and pats Wendy's cheek with her hand. Isn't this girl drunk?
	But when she touches Wendy's skin, Jamie feels that something is wrong since her body temperature is high!
	She puts her palms on Wendy's forehead and feels an amazingly hot temperature!
	She has a fever!
	The situation doesn’t allow Jamie to think about it. She immediately holds Wendy up. Her body is soft. She is not as powerful as she is in normal days.
	In Jamie's heart, there is many angers now. Her legs are still trembling. However, now she is carrying Wendy downstairs and takes her to the parking lot to get the car, which almost kills her.
	"I’m going to die!" Jamie rolls her eyes, struggling to support Wendy into the car. She helps her fasten the seat belt and then gets into the driver's seat. Then the car rushes out.
	Jamie drives to the hospital and sends Wendy into the ward with the help of those doctors and nurses.
	"The patient just has a cold. She will be better when she wakes up after the fever." The doctor tells Jamie while writing quickly on a medical record book.
	"Okay, thank you." Jamie says to him politely, and looks at Wendy, who is lying on the bed and hiving an intravenous drip. Finally she feels relieved.
	Suddenly remembering that she hasn’t taking medicine for Wendy yet, Jamie pats her head and immediately stands up to walk out.
	Jamie takes the medicine and prepares to go back. But when she is turning the corner, she sees a figure walking past from not far away.
	Jamie's footsteps slow down, feeling doubtful. How will Alma be here? Is Jozo here too?
	If she doesn’t recognize it wrongly, the person next to Alma seems to be Derek. It is really strange.
	It’s not a big deal that Alma is here. But how will Derek be here?
	Is Dan also here?
	Thinking of this, Jamie's steps begins to move involuntarily towards their direction and follows them quietly.
	
Chapter 216 She Feels Bad about It
	Alma and Dan come to the door of a ward and open the door to walk in.
	Jamie walks closer by a few steps and moves to the door. She looks in through a glass window on the door.
	It is Jozo who is still lying on the bed.
	Her eyes are very gentle with a strong fascination. She looks directly at the man sitting in front of her.
	Jamie actually feels upset at the same. A surprise flashes in her eyes because the man is Dan.
	He says that he has something to solve. So he comes to accompany Jozo?
	Jamie holds back the discomfort in her heart and purses her mouth with a grievance, staring fiercely at Dan's back head.
	Dan doesn’t realize that Jamie is outside. His voice is always cold, but at this moment it’s softer. "You don't have to worry about this. Just take care of your health."
	"I know. But I don't know if I can stand up after this falling?" Jozo says when there is sadness and struggles in her beautiful eyes, as if she is worrying her future.
	Sure enough, this sentence attacks Dan's guilt. And the sights that he looks at Jozo become more and more gentle.
	"Yes, I will find the best doctor for you, who will definitely help you stand up again." Dan seriously promises to her. Anyway, he owes Jozo.
	"Alma, you didn’t take good care of Jozo. Go and get the punishment." Dan orders indifferently to Alma without any emotions.
	Jozo glances at Alma happily but she looks at Dan with a bit of pity. "Dan, will it be bad? I'm fine now. Don't punish her."
	"She doesn’t fulfill her duty, and she should be punished." Dan doesn’t have any expression on his cold face and his thin lips twitches slightly. He doesn't seem to care.
	Hearing their conversation, Jamie doesn’t feel comfortable in her heart.
	When she sees Alma coming out, she immediately hides aside and comes out after she leaves.
	Alma stays with Dan all the time, so she also grows up with Jamie. Like Derek, Alma is important for Dan.
	Although Jamie has also been in trouble before and Dan also punishes Alma and Derek several times, but in the end, he is entangled by Jamie. Finally, after Jamie uses all means to beg him, Dan gives up on punishing them.
	The constant jealousness in the heart is about to overwhelm Jamie. But she still looks so calm in her face that people can’t see what she is thinking.
	"Dan, can you stay with me these days? I'm afraid ..." Jozo uses her soft voice to beg him.
	Don't promise her. Don't promise her!
	The thought clamors in Jamie's mind, and she knows that if she comes in at this moment, she is 100 percent sure that Dan will refuse Jozo
	But she can’t.
	She wants to hear if Dan will answer her request...
	At this moment, she is worried. She listens carefully to the conversation inside with her breath holding.
	"Well." There is no change in his clear and cold voice, like the broken ice and snow on the glacier. His words knock on Jamie's heart again and again.
	He agrees.
	It seems that there are hopes broken in Jamie's bright eyes, and her whole person becomes seized with a deep sorrow. Her shoulders droop down weakly, and the feeling of loss actually makes her cry.
	Later, Jamie is not in a mood to listen what they are talking about. She drags her heavy steps back to Wendy's ward.
	If she had known, she would not be curious and keep up to have a look.
	"What happens? Why do you look cheerless?" Wendy's voice is hoarse with some nasal sounds.
	"It’s you who look cheerless!" Jamie gives her an angry look and walks to the bed to open the bag in her hand. Then she takes out the medicine.
	"Then you’re irritated.”
	Jamie pours the medicine in the bottle cap and brews the granule in the cup. She hands it to her and glares at her by the way, "You are the one who is irritated. Do you still harm me while you’re lying here?"
	The way she and Wendy get along with is always like this. They seem to dislike each other on the surface. Actually they love each other forever. Therefore they have no need to care about what they talk to each other.
	Wendy doesn't speak again.
	Judging by Jamie's understandings for her over the years, Wendy has something weird.
	"Do you drink a lot yesterday? How does it feel to sleep on the ground?" Jamie can directly ask her what happened. But she knows that there must be a reason that Wendy will sleep on the ground so uncomfortably all night.
	"Jamie, he loves someone. And that person is excellent." Wendy says quietly but only expresses a lonely feeling.
	Wendy, who usually looks optimistic even if the heaven will collapse, looks particularly distressed at this moment.
	Jamie purses her lips and looks at her in surprise. Does Duke have a girlfriend?
	"He's so gentle to the people he likes. It’s better if one day he is so gentle to me." Wendy's voice seems extremely calm.
	"But I never think that he isn't indifferent in nature. His care is only offered to that woman." Wendy's eyes shows her struggling feelings and she watches at Jamie with a rare helplessness and depression. .
	Free, easy and candid as Wendy is, how will she be trapped by a man?
	But Jamie does not give her advice or comfort as before because she is also trapped in the love for Dan now.
	But she can’t believe in it. For people like Duke, if he has girlfriends, he will definitely let Dan and Bruce know. If Bruce knows, then the whole world will know.
	There is no reason that it is discovered by Wendy until now.
	Jamie sighs. After all, she and Dan still have a lot of opportunities. But Wendy and Duke haven't started yet and it's over.
	She doesn’t know what to say and she can only hug Wendy to comfort her.
	Wendy grabs her arm like a drowning man who is grabbing driftwood, "Jamie, you know that they don't give me much time. If I haven't had a result with him before this year's birthday, I really can't be with him anymore. "
	"I just want to be with him." Her eyes looks empty, and no one knows what she is looking at.
	Jamie just counts for the days. Wendy’s birthday is on December 24 this year and it’s the day of Christmas Eve, which has five months away.
	If Wendy hasn’t been with Duke before her 23rd birthday, Wendy will have to become others’ wife.
	Wendy’s family is also a noble family in City A. Wendy is their sole daughter. Since childhood, she is naturally held in the palms of their hands with care and love. But instead of raising Wendy into a lady, she has developed a free and natural character, which makes her like a tomboy.
	Wendy’s family and the Charlies have arranged marriage when they’re very young. Wendy is reluctant to marry someone she has never seen before. Eventually after she argues on the basis of reason, she wins several years to find someone she likes and she needs to engage with that man. However, her birthday in this year is the deadline.
	
Chapter 217 Bunny, You Seem to Be Heavier
	Jamie is also reluctant to let Wendy marry a person she hasn't seen before. It’s bullshit to state that affections can be developed anyway. Without a foundation, how can they develop?
	Jamie sometimes feels very distressed about Wendy. It will be better if she likes Bruce. Why will she like Duke who is cold and indifferent?
	"No. There are still five months left. The player can still create goals while there is a goalkeeper? There's no throne that can't be robbed. Only the eunuch who doesn't work hard will fail!" Jamie says encouragingly, patting her on her shoulder.
	"Do you describe me as a eunuch?"
	"It's just an analogy." Jamie shrugs innocently and tilts her head for a moment. Doesn’t the saying go in this way?
	Wendy chuckles and asks, "Are you revenge for what happened last night?"
	Last night?
	A trace of confusion flashes in Jamie's eyes, and then she thinks of something. Then she gives Wendy a cold view!
	"How dare you mention it?" Jamie glares at her with her teeth gritted. She almost wants to strangle her to death.
	"Did you..." Wendy looks at Jamie with the intention of gossip.
	Jamie's pretty face quickly becomes angry. If Wendy isn’t sick, she will strangle her.
	As soon as she sees her reaction, Wendy understands it. Unexpectedly, this fool actually gets Dan!
	"Tell me more detail!" Wendy grabs Jamie's arm and her eyes are shining brightly.
	"Go away. Don't bother me if you don't want to lose your arms and legs." Jamie pats her hand impatiently and looks at her with disdain.
	Wendy's eyes rolls round and round, "Okay, I won’t ask. But you have to tell me who is on the above!"
	Before she has finished speaking, she is interrupted by a burst clout. Then Wendy glares at her while covering her head.
	"There's so much nonsense of your words. It's still useful for violence." Jamie blows the dust that doesn’t exist on the blower and looks at her provocatively. "Look at you. You’re active now. Let's go and get discharged."
	After completing the discharge procedures and taking medicine of a few days, Jamie and Wendy go back to the apartment.
	Jamie has planned to return to the manor after today, but Wendy is ill. So she stays here to take care of her.
	The two girls nests on the sofa in the apartment and watches the movie while holding a plate of fruit. The indoor lights are dimmed and the atmosphere is great.
	It doesn’t take a long time for the door to ring. And Jamie stands up and comes out to open the door, wiping tears from the corner of her eyes.
	The door opens with a click, "Mommy!"
	It’s Ian’s soft and sweet voice. Jamie looks down and sees Ian’s soft and handsome little face. He wears casual clothing and looks charming, and carries the same backpack as Jamie’s. Then he rushes into Jamie’s arms.
	Jamie doesn’t expect Ian to come here at this time and she is frozen for a moment. Then she feels surprised.
	"Baby, why are you here now?"
	Ian looks at Jamie with a worried expression, and answers, "Mommy, it's not suitable to talk here. Let me go in and talk."
	Jamie laughs with surprise. He is a little boy and it’s funny for him to pretend to be an adult.
	She reaches out and squeezes Ian's soft little face while holding him in. The little face is chubby. It seems that he has lived well without her in these days.
	"Bunny, you seem to be heavier." Jamie pinches Ian's small arms and short legs again. Well, he is chubbier than before but he’s more sensual when she hugs him.
	Speaking of this, Ian's small face is wrinkled. He has no way that the food is too delicious. The more he eats, the heavier he is.
	In fact, Ian uses to be thin but now he has more flesh. But it is still a good thing.
	But handsome Ian personally thinks that there is no masculinity if he looks chubby.
	"Bunny is not fat. All you have is the essence!" Ian hugs Jamie. He is not used to these days without being around mummy.
	"Hah, yes. It’s the essence. The baby is cute to be chubby." Wendy reaches out and Jamie takes Ian into her arms. She walks to turn on the light in the living room.
	Ian is held in Wendy's arms, kissed and pinched by Wendy. He doesn’t feel unhappy and allow her behavior.
	"But Bunny, you're not in your father's place. Have you come to find us?" Wendy sees the little backpack behind Ian and opens it to have a look. There are actually some daily necessities and some clothes.
	"Bad boy. Do you learn to run away from home at such a young age?" Jamie sees the things inside and her mouth twitches. Then she reaches out and grabs Ian's ear.
	Did Dan do anything to him? Otherwise, why did he run out?
	Mentioning of this, Ian feels uncomfortable, sulking with a small face. He says angrily, "It's dad who is stupid. He brings a woman to home. The woman comes to find Bunny and says the bad things about mommy. Bunny is so angry that I just run out. "
	Jamie feels distressed in her heart, rubbing Ian's hair. She looks at his clear eyes and feels a little helpless, "We don’t care about your dad even if he marry countless women. Anyway, mommy can takes you to marry countless men. "
	The fruit which Wendy has just swallowed almost gets stuck in her throat. She glances at Jamie silently and hugs Ian into her arms. "Have anyone taught the kids like this?"
	Jamie shrugs because it’s just an statement out of anger.
	"Bunny, listen to aunt. Don't listen to your mommy. Your father is so handsome. There must be many women who adore him. If you leave now, you’re giving that woman a chance, aren’t?" Wendy knows that Ian could understand what she says, so she says it directly.
	She knows that Ian is not an ordinary child. And his mind is much more mature and stable than a child. Many things can be understood by him with a little direction.
	Ian looks at Wendy in a sudden awareness, "I know it. Bunny can't go because Bunny has to take mom home to defeat those evil women!"
	Ian is only a child no matter how smart he is. He doesn’t understand much about the minds of adults, but he has been in contact with them before in the UK. So when Wendy says that, he knows what is the problem.
	That woman is just to drive him out and that’s good for her to approach Dan. If he leaves in this way, isn’t it satisfying her wishes?
	Thinking of this, Ian trembles and thinks it so horrible. It is more disgusting than the scheming between a king’s concubines in the ancient times.
	He doesn’t want mommy to be targeted or exploited. But it seems that there is no other way for him.
	When Jamie is about to say something, the phone rings suddenly. And she takes it from the table and looks at it. It’s Dan’s call.
	"Are we going to answers it?" Jamie shows Wendy and Ian the screen while her smile is sly and with a hint of spoof. It’s obvious that she doesn’t want to answers it.
	Well, he just let her baby be angry. How can the punishment be enough?
	"No," Ian and Wendy shake their heads together, answering firmly.
	"Then we don't answer it." Jamie doesn’t hang up the phone and put the phone aside to ignore it.
	But the bell rings for a while and then rings again.
	
Chapter 218 The Most Powerful Villain
	"Mommy, should we answer it? It's not good for Daddy." Ian feels distressed to Dan. After all, Dan doesn’t know that he comes out because of anger, nor what the woman says to him.
	He seems so innocent to be ignored aside.
	"Why should we care about him? Just let him worry for a while." Jamie snorts. Seeing the scene in the hospital, she hasn’t stopped her fire. How can it be so fast to solve her anger?
	After the phone rings for a while, it stops and doesn’t ring again. Ian doesn’t bring the phone out, so Dan can’t contact with him.
	Jamie and Ian glances at each other. So is it over?
	The phone rings again but it is not Jamie’s.
	"Mine." Wendy takes her cell phone, and the caller is a stranger. But she doesn’t think of anything and answers it, "Hello?"
	"Let Jamie answer the phone." A clear voice comes from there with a chilly emotion. And it sounds very low.
	"God!" Wendy is so scared that she throws her phone directly into Jamie's arms. "Quickly. It’s from your boss!"
	How can he find her? Her mobile phone number has changed a few times. Except Jamie and Ian, few people know her phone numbers. How can Dan know it in such a short time?
	It’s terrible!
	Jamie glances at the screen and swallows saliva. Without the courage to hang up his phone, she put it carefully near her ear and says, "Hello?"
	"Bunny is not here. Does he stay with you?" Dan's voice is calm with a slight doubt.
	"Well, yes. He's with me." Jamie struggles to answers him. She looks at Ian, who is innocently playing his fingers. This little idiot! He actually provokes the most powerful villain!
	There is silence for a few seconds over there. It’s so quiet that Jamie is worried. Then she hears Dan’s question, "Where are you? Didn’t I tell you to go back to the manor after you wake up?"
	She doesn’t know if it’s Jamie’s illusion or not. Although his voice is indifferent, he feels helpless and just dotes on her, as if there’s a feather lightly brushing her heart.
	She suddenly remembers that night in the hotel and her face suddenly bursts into a red one. Ian turns his head and looks at Wendy silently.
	Wendy nods her head clearly and gives him a sign with her eyes. That is, your mom must have thought of something impure so she acts like this.
	Ian bites his lip and nods, seemingly understanding it.
	"Why don’t you speak?" Dan hears the news of Ian's safety and becomes not so anxious. Then he asks slowly.
	"Nothing ..." Jamie blushes. Fortunately he isn’t here; otherwise she will lose her face and will be totally ashamed.
	"When will you come back?" He continues to ask.
	Jamie is almost bewitched by him and is about to say "immediately". Fortunately, she regains her consciousness in time and stops thinking about what happened last night.
	"That depends on my mood." Jamie raises her small chin and says arrogantly.
	You can just take your woman and enjoy your life!
	"Well?" Dan sighs lazily and fascinatingly with a heavy tone. Jamie seems to be able to see his lazy and casual look through the phone screen.
	Her hand trembles and she hangs up quickly. Otherwise, she will be seduced by him.
	"What's mummy thinking?" Ian feels it so strange when he sees Jamie smirking, tangling and getting annoyed. He touches her forehead and knows that she doesn’t have a fever.
	Is Daddy's phone so powerful that it makes mummy confused?
	"Go away. I don’t think of Dan." Jamie moves his little hand away and says subconsciously.
	"Oh! It turns out that mommy is thinking about daddy!" Ian shows a big smile and his big eyes shows the cunning feelings.
	Wendy hugs Ian. The little body with some flesh feels so cute, "The behavior of your mommy is called to yearn for love and she is quite honest."
	Jamie is embarrassed that she unconsciously says what is in her heart. Somewhat she is annoyed. She glares at them and turns her head away.
	Even if she misses him, she is thinking about how to kill his wooers!
	At the same time, Dan leans against the railing of the roof of the room, looking at the screen of the mobile phone. His eyebrows are as sharp as mountain peaks and his eyes are as bright as stars. Amazement appears on his cold and handsome face.
	His finger taps on the screen a few times, and then he sends her a message.
	The phone vibrates and Jamie sees a message, which is sent by Dan.
	[Didn’t I satisfy you last night?]
	With a loud bang, Jamie's small face, which has already returned to normal, becomes red again. This time it is much redder than before. The infinitely shy look really attracts others’ attention.
	How can he say so ...directly?
	Jamie doesn’t know how to answer him and her small face almost sticks on the phone screen. Fortunately, Ian and Wendy are watching TV and don’t notice her movements. Otherwise she will definitely lose her face.
	[What happened last night? I do not remember! ] Jamie edits a message with her blushing face and adds an angry expression. Then she clicks to send out.
	The phone rings. Dan turns on the screen and sees the text message from Jamie. He stops and a light smile spreads across his lips. He quickly clicks on the screen and sends a message.
	Jamie is receiving a bottle of milk from Ian when she hears the phone ringing. While holding the straw and taking a sip of sweet and sour milk, she opens the message and looks at it.
	[You are much more enthusiastic last night. ]
	"Oops!" The milk that Jamie hasn’t swallowed is immediately spited out when she sees this sentence. Fortunately, she turns her head in time to avoid polluting Wendy's crystal table with cute tablecloth covered.
	"It looks disgusting. Clean it quickly." Wendy gives her a disdainful look. She takes a paper towel from the side and throws it on Jamie.
	Jamie wipes the water stains on the edge of the sofa in a hurry while placing the milk bottle on the table.
	"What's the matter with mommy? This is a tragedy." Ian glances at the TV screen, which is showing the scene that the hero and heroine are separating. He doesn’t find it interesting.
	"Your mommy just yearns for love recently. Don't worry about her." Wendy waves her hand casually, looking at the screen and not feeling how sad the scenario is.
	It's just used to kill time.
	Ian moves his mouth, nods and continues to watch the movie.
	Jamie throws the wet tissue into the trash can. She picks up the phone and turns on the phone while being ashamed. Then she deletes all the text messages that sent by him and she calms down.
	Jamie feels wronged in her heart. How can he disrupt her mind after being so close to Jozo?
	She likes him, but she won't be humble.
	Calm down, calm down. Jamie, don't be angry about these trifles. Take a deep breath. Inhale and exhale...
	But she doesn’t knows that after taking a deep breath, Jamie feels uncomfortable as if a breath is stuck in her heart .
	It's not her style to be so tolerant and uncomfortable!

Chapter 219 Dance Macabre
	Jamie clenches her fist, and her eyes look like a misty lake shrouded by a layer of blurred glory. And a firm decision shows in the bottom of her eyes.
	…
	In the manor.
	Dan goes to the company. In the large restaurant, only Jozo is dining on the rectangular dining table, which seems to only appear on western feast. With Alma standing behind her, she is also accompanied by two rows of servants standing on both sides of the table.
	Jozo looks at Cindy. She smiles and says, "Today's breakfast is good. Thank you."
	"This is what we should do." Cindy doesn't like Jozo. But since she is a guest of Dan, they have to take good care of her. So she responds politely.
	Jozo doesn’t speak anymore. Her face always has gentle smile and she looks at the layout of the villa quietly.
	The furnishings and decoration of the villa are very particular while it’s luxurious and low-key. But it will not be dazzling, giving people a very enjoyable feeling.
	As soon as she thinks of staying here again with Dan, she feels that she is floating happily.
	She raises her eyebrows triumphantly, and drinks the soup.
	At this moment, Jamie and Ian walk into the villa while holding each other’s hands. Those on the patrol are very familiar with Jamie and Ian. When they see them, they say hello politely and respectfully.
	"Mommy, Daddy is in the company this time. Don't you need to go?" Ian turns to look at Jamie. They’re getting closer and closer to the villa. They walk to the door and opens it.
	"He’s in the company ..." Jamie trances for a while and her whole person feels shocked as if she is attacked heavily.
	She uses her fingers to count and finally she breathes a sigh of relief.
	"Mommy, there seems to be someone in the restaurant." Ian hears the sound of chopsticks and bowls in the restaurant.
	He can hear that the person uses light force when he picks it up and down. So it mustn’t be Dan.
	Hearing these, Ian becomes little dissatisfied. He drags Jamie and doesn’t want to let her in.
	"No matter who he is, let's go upstairs." Jamie glances at the restaurant carelessly. Then she takes Ian's soft little hand and walks up the spiral staircase.
	A sound of wheelchair rubbing against the floor turns out behind them. Jozo's soft voice comes and it sounds so sweet, "Is Miss Moore back?"
	Jamie just feels shivering. Hearing the sound, she seems to have goose flesh and have the Dance Macabre in her body. She turns around on the stairs and looks at her.
	She has to say that Jozo is indeed beautiful, unlike July's visually striking beauty. She always has a soft smile on the corner of her mouth, giving a gentle and tender feeling.
	But such kinds of people are really dangerous.
	Jozo's patience is very good, and she knows how to use the brain to achieve her goals. This is what Amelia can't compare with.
	However, with such a hypocritical smile, Jamie feels tired when she just sees it.
	"What's the matter?" Jamie asks lukewarmly and a little indifferent emotion turns out on her small face, as if it doesn’t affect her mood with Jozo’s existence.
	"Is Miss Moore going upstairs? I don't know which room is yours. My room is on the far right of the second floor. Dan arranges it for me." Jozo is pushed by Alma towards the stairs and she looks up at Jamie, who is standing on the stairs and looks impatient but has to pretend to smile.
	On the far right of the second floor?
	Jamie's lips raise a smile. The rooms on the far right of the second floor are all used to entertain guests.
	"Of course my mommy is staying with Daddy. What does it matter with my mommy where do you live?" Ian glances at Jozo with a cool expression on his small face, refuting Jozo's words back.
	Jozo looks at Ian on the side of Jamie and exposes a trace of imperceptible disgust. She thinks that what she said to him last night could make them shrink back from difficulties. Unexpectedly, this little boy brings Jamie back.
	Jozo doesn’t care about Ian's words. She thinks he is just bragging for the sake of grumbling for his mother.
	"Miss Moore, your child is really clever and he’s very similar to Miss Moore." Jozo glances at Jamie and Ian, leaving such a meaningful sentence. Then she lets Alma push her out of the villa.
	"Mommy, watch out for her." Ian hold Jamie's hand a little heavily and says.
	This woman is very dangerous.
	"Mommy knows it. Even if she wants to something, she has to understand where she lives now. And I will not let her succeed." Jamie shrugs indifferently and leads Ian upstairs.
	Fortunately, Jozo doesn’t do anything extraordinary during the meal. A few rhetorical words are not harmful for Jamie. Jozo just asks for a snub. For Jamie’s calmness and ignorance, she gives up fawning on her.
	It seems that there are many works recently in CR. Although Jamie spends the week at Moon's filming location and Wendy's house, she hasn't missed anything about CR.
	A week ago, Dan is seriously hospitalized and injures his right hand. So it piles up a lot of documents waiting for him to see. In addition, CR has recently bid for an investment case. Dan will be busier in recent times.
	When she hears that Dan will be busier, Jamie doesn’t take it seriously. He can still take time to accompany the beauty to the party, which shows that he still has much spare time.
	At nine o'clock in the evening, the car of Dan still doesn’t show up. Jozo sits in the living room and waits. It seems that she won’t go to sleep until he comes back.
	Jamie doesn't care so much. She can just wait if she likes. Then she goes upstairs to prepare for sleep.
	Instead of falling asleep immediately, she takes out her white laptop and turns it on. Then she connects it with the wireless network and goes surfing on the network.
	After watching it for a long time, she feels tired and prepares to sleep. But she can’t fall asleep.
	"How can you film tomorrow if you don't sleep?" Jamie rubs her hair helplessly, and suddenly remembers that Dan's study is beside. She can go to get a book to read. Maybe she will fall asleep while reading it.
	In the past, when Jamie can’t sleep, it’s a normal method for her. No matter what book it is, as long as it is a book she can’t understand, she can sleep at first sight!
	The light is on in the study, and she stands in front of the bookshelf to look for a book.
	This is the first time she walks into the study. It has black and white style and it really fits his character.
	Her gaze suddenly stops at a collection of stories.
	Only this book is placed upside down.
	This arouses Jamie's curiosity.
	This book is very familiar.
	She opens it and looks at it a few times. She finds no difference. When she is ready to put it back and find a new one, a blue sticky note suddenly falls.
	Jamie thinks it is weird. She picks it up and looks at it. There are lively and vigorous characters on it.
	Page one hundred and twenty-one, line four, twelfth word; page one hundred and forty-eighth, line twelve, seventh word; page one hundred and seventy-six, line ten…
	What does these mean?
	When thinking about it, the sound of a car stalling suddenly comes from downstairs. Jamie doesn’t think too much, and puts the book in place and goes back to the room.
	
Chapter 220 The Loophole
	The study has always been the most confidential place. She sneaked in once before and it is so frightened. If she is discovered by Dan again, she definitely cannot explain it clearly.
	She returns to the master bedroom, locks the door, and goes to bed.
	In the downstairs, Jozo has heard the sound of the car stopping outside and the footsteps get closer and closer to the living room. When Dan approaches her, she looks at him sleepily and smiles gently. , "Dan, are you back? I've been waiting for you for a long time."
	Dan doesn’t expect Jozo to wait for him here at this time. His frown, and nods lightly, "What's the matter?"
	"Nothing. I just want to thank you for letting me live here." Jozo moves her wheelchair and gets closer to Dan. Her face is filled with gratitude while she looks up at him.
	"That’s all right, I owe you a lot." Dan nods slightly. A week's work is accumulated together, which totally overwhelms him. Even his eyebrows can show his exhaustion.
	Jozo continues her words, "I think you are tired. Let me rub your shoulders."
	"No need. You can go to bed early." Dan quietly pulls the lower hem from her hand. Then he walks behind her and pushes her towards the elevator.
	After Dan sends Jozo back to the guest bedroom, he returns to the master bedroom without stopping.
	When he first enters the bedroom, he feels something is wrong. It seems that she is back.
	Dan can’t help chuckling. He immediately treads lightly and walks to the bed.
	Jamie originally pretends to sleep but since Dan doesn’t come back for a long time, she can’t bear it and falls asleep.
	He hasn’t seen her for a week, and he thinks that she will not come back for a while.
	Dan knows that Jamie's attitude toward him seems to be related to the matter five years ago. He lets Derek to investigate it. But it turns out that she is sent away by the Moores by her will.
	What is the loophole?
	Even Bunny tells him that it is his fault...
	He sighs and takes his gaze away from Jamie, rubbing his eyebrows. The injuries on his back and shoulders are still hurting, but they keep him awake all the time.
	He removes the bandage. He can’t apply medicine to the wound alone. He can only apply the medicine to the wound on his shoulder casually. Then he lies beside Jamie, watching her sleeping face, and falls asleep.
	…
	Jamie is suffocated and is awaken because her breathing is not smooth. The first thing she sees when she wakes up is a long arm, which is lying across her chest. Suddenly she rolls her eyes up.
	She has just dreamed that she has fallen into the sea and is so flooded that she can’t even breathe. It seems to cause her to almost suffocate and die.
	It turns out to be because of an arm!
	Jamie angrily removes the thing that is pressing on her breasts and sits up.
	As soon as she turns his head, she sees Dan's scary scar.
	The gunshot wound is not easy to recover and Dan does not let the nurse apply medicine on him. In these days, he has been more casual to use the medicine so that it doesn’t recover for a long time.
	Jamie feels distressed, and she purses her lips vigorously. Without hesitation, she goes to the bathroom to wash.
	A girl will doll herself up for the one who loves her. In the past, Jamie might have applied him medicine without hesitation, even if she is raunchy.
	But now, she cares about how Dan will think about her a lot.
	After washing, Jamie takes the wound medicine from the table, and then she sits carefully on the other side. On her right hand is Dan's back so it is convenient to apply the medicine.
	Perhaps because of the pain caused by disinfectant, Dan suddenly opens his cold eyes.
	Jamie's eyes flicks and she is so scared that she doesn’t hold the cotton swab well and it falls straightly on his wound.
	"Ah." He grunts.
	Jamie hurriedly picks up the cotton swab, and some of the bubbles of disinfectant stay on the wound. It seems that she can still hear the noise.
	She is very afraid of pain. When the disinfectant touches the wound, for the sour and refreshing feeling, no one wants to try it. She naturally knows how painful it is.
	"I, I’m not deliberate to do this. I just want to help you apply medicine ..." She wrinkles her neck and explains with a lack of confidence. She doesn’t intentionally drop a cotton swab soaked with so much disinfectant on his wound!
	It is just that he suddenly wakes up and she is frightened.
	"Hmm." Dan holds back all emotions in his heart and responds softly. He turns his head away and closes his eyes to continue his sleep.
	Jamie breathes a sigh of relief soon. It’s lucky that he is not angry. She worries that he will suddenly throw her out. It’s really terrible.
	With permission, she is much relaxed. And the gesture of applying the disinfection is not so stiff. It softens a lot. She disinfects it intently and she begins to apply the medicine.
	The soft little hands touch the skin on his back from time to time. Dan opens his eyes and looks sideways. He can see that she is seriously helping him apply medicine. Her bright and clear eyes are covered with a kind of distress.
	Her look is very gentle and even the lines of her face are tenderer while her pink lips slightly purses, which makes people want to kiss her.
	They two are very close, and the delicate fragrance of her body lingers around him accompanied with a calming atmosphere.
	Dan's black eyes have a little trance, and he looks at Jamie's small face. He doesn’t know why does his feelings is so sweet like honey.
	"Okay." Finally she finishes applying the medicine. Then she puts a bandage on him and screws up the bottle cap. She throws the used cotton swab into the trash can. She is about to stand up but she feels her legs paralyzed because she has kneeled for a long time...
	Jamie's heart collapses, and the numbness of her legs makes her dare not to move at all. Once she moves, she really wants to smile because she is uncomfortable with the itch.
	This feeling is really annoying!
	Dan thinks she will get up and leave after she finishes applying the medicine. But after a while, he finds that she hasn't moved, and her whole person seems to freeze.
	He frowns slightly and turns his head to look directly at her eyes. He asks in a cold voice, "What's wrong?"
	Jamie hears his inquiry and looks up at him with a sad expression which shows a bit struggling feeling and a little depression, "My legs ... My legs become numb."
	Dan's lips twitch gently, and he slowly sits up from the bed. He walks to the cloakroom to change clothes and walks out while buttoning his shirt.
	Jamie rubs her paralyzed legs gently with her hands. It seems that every cell is bitten by an ant and it is painful and itchy. But she can only bear it.
	She knows that Dan comes out, but she doesn’t dare to look up at him. She feels nervous as if her heart is held by a hand. A little blush appears on her small face. From Dan’s perspective, it looks charming like a peach.
	He finishes buttoning on his shirt and walks over. He looks at her lightly and picks up the jacket on the side and leaves the bedroom without stopping.
	Back then, he would come over and rub her legs to ease it. Moreover, he would scold that she is stupid.
Chapter 221 There Is a Demon in the Front
	However, now Dan only wants to calm down so as not to do some abnormal things and makes her misunderstand.
	For that night, it is a sweet mistake.
	The door clicks lightly. Jamie, who is sitting in the middle of the bed, sighs with relief. There is some loss in her heart.
	When the legs are not so numb, she slowly sits down and straightens her legs. Her whole person falls into the soft bed. She covers her head with the quilt used by Dan and rolls a few times on it.
	When she breathes, there is a light scent of mint of his body, as if he is still here.
	It takes a while for Jamie to discover what she is doing. She is actually holding his quilt and missing him!
	God!
	Jamie suddenly arches her back like a shrimp and she moves into the quilt to hide her embarrassment.
	Soon, she recovers her mood. Then she raises her calf and kicks off the quilt covering on her body. She jumps from the bed and puts on shoes. Then she walks out.
	It is still early and is about seven o'clock. The filming of the promotional film begins at eight thirty, but obviously Jamie doesn’t notice it at all.
	When she walks to the restaurant, Ian has finished breakfast and is going to school. When he sees Jamie coming down, he kisses her cheek and lets the driver send him to school.
	"Mommy, there is a demon in front. Be careful!" This is what Ian says to Jamie before leaving. He is very innocent and cute.
	But what Ian says really has a connotative meaning.
	In the restaurant, Dan is sitting in the main seat. On his left hand is the carefully dressed Jozo. When she comes in, Jozo greets her friendly and cordially.
	Jamie responds indifferently and she sits in a place which is two seats away from Dan. Then she lets Cindy to prepare her breakfast.
	Dan doesn’t even have a look at her. He dines elegantly, just like the nobility in Western oil paintings, who can show his noble dignity with his behaviors.
	"Why does Miss Moore sit there? Come here to sit. I leave the place to you particularly." Jozo sees Jamie sitting far away, so she looks at her in amazement and acts as a hostess, and greets Jamie to come over.
	Unexpectedly, Jamie just glances at her faintly. She enjoys the breakfast in front of her and says, "No, I have a quirk. I will vomit if someone sits opposite to me when I eat."
	Dan's mouth raises and he takes a sip of the coffee in hand to conceal the smile at the corner of his mouth.
	Jozo becomes embarrassed and she obviously doesn't believe that someone will have this quirk. "Then Miss Moore, please help yourself."
	Jamie ignores the meaning of her words and adopts a policy of neglecting. She just enjoys the breakfast in front of her wholeheartedly.
	She eats quickly and the dishes in front of her are almost empty. But her table manners don’t look rude. She was very frank and cute, which makes others’ appetite increase when they look at her.
	Jozo can’t help sneering. She really never experiences various aspects of society. She looks like a starved guy. No one will rob her food, so she indeed humiliates herself!
	If Jamie hears what she thinks about, she’s afraid that she might throw her fork in Jozo’s coiled hair. Jozo’s thoughts are really boring.
	"Dan, hasn't Amelia returned yet? Are you still angry with her?" Jozo suddenly remembers Amelia's request and puts down the knife and fork in her hand. She almost eats nothing.
	"Yes." Dan responds and his eyes are flashing slightly. He doesn't seem to care about the matter.
	In order to prevent Amelia and Jamie from getting bored with each other and fighting when they meet, Dan sends Amelia back to the William’s house.
	That is to say, Amelia cannot come back here until she fully accepts the fact that Jamie will be her brother’s wife in the future.
	"Amelia is still young. Even if she makes any mistakes, she is unintentional. You are her brother, so she will be so capricious because you will support her. Why do you punish her for others?" Jozo says gently, illustrating that Amelia is his only sister. Therefore, it takes him for granted to spoil her. And she also defames Jamie.
	The implication is that Amelia is your younger sister so you need to spoil her. Don't let the relationship between them destroy because of Jamie, who is an outsider.
	Dan ponders for a few seconds, seeming to think about the meaning of Jozo's words. After a while, he doesn't make any reply but nods lightly.
	Jozo is anxious because she promises Amelia that she will persuade Dan to let her come back. But Dan doesn't seem to have the intention to get her back.
	Will it ... because of Jamie?
	Jamie has finished the food on the plate and is slowly drinking the sour milk in the cup. It is warm and can warm her stomach. She pretends not to see Jozo's sights and generally looks away.
	If she fusses about such trivial matters, she might have some problems for herself. Anyway, it won’t hurt her with Jozo’s words. As long as she doesn’t reach her bottom line, no matter what she says or does, Jamie decides to ignore it.
	She has seen others who are more powerful than Jozo.
	Of Katt’s lovers, most of them are the kind of this people. They looks gentle and pure like the merits of white lotus flower, while they are secretly bitches who are good at infighting and scheming.
	Needless to say, the minority are all solved by Jamie's fist.
	In addition to being a designer for Katt, she is also a shield. She can design beautiful clothes and can drive away those women like beating the monsters and change maps as if she does in the game. But she is paid double.
	Since returning home, Jamie feels that she is a real lady!
	"To forget. It’s not easy to forget. I’ll not blame you. It's my..." A melodious ring of cellphone turns out. Jamie's whole body trembles and she touches her clothes pocket. Where is her phone?
	She touches the pants pocket but she still can’t find it.
	"Jamie, it’s on the table." Cindy behind her can’t bear that Jamie is anxious to find her phone so she reminds her.
	Embarrassment!
	There is a vivid embarrassment on Jamie's face. She picks up the phone on the table and quickly answers it by putting it near her ear, "Hello?"
	"Jamie, have you overslept again?" Ryan's warm voice blames her with a touch of deliberate temptation.
	"No, I have got up already." Jamie answers doubtfully.
	"Look at what time it is now. Can we still finish the filming?" Ryan breathes a sigh of relief, reminding her that it is not early now.
	Jamie glances at the time quickly. Oh my god. It is already past eight o'clock. No wonder Ryan would call her.
	Moon has strict time requirements. So Jamie is filming on time these days. But today she forgets it!
	What bad her brain is!
	"Ryan, I'm sorry. I’m having breakfast and I almost forget it. I'm coming now ..." Jamie wrinkles her small face with regret. As she packs up her bag, she stands up and goes out.
	Without even realizing that Dan's eyes darken when he hears her calling Ryan. His gesture of holding a coffee cup also stops.
Chapter 222 Crystal Hall
	"Miss Moore seems to be very busy ... Dan, where are you going?" Jozo asks jealously, and Dan suddenly stands up to leave the restaurant without a word.
	Jozo struggles hard and moves the tire unwillingly to catch up with him.
	Jamie trots all the way to the gate of the manor. Her speed has been improved to the extreme, but the villa is far from the main entrance of the manor. No matter how fast she runs, it is still far away.
	At this time she wishes to have eight legs so that she can run to the door in a short second.
	At this time, a black Bugatti Veyron stops beside her and the window goes down. Dan's beautiful and handsome face appears. He says quietly, "Get in the car."
	Jamie is stunned, and she immediately realizes that he is going to take her for a ride. Without refusing, she quickly opens the door.
	"Place." Dan starts the car as soon as she sits down and says.
	"Crystal Hall." Jamie thinks about it and reports the place.
	She remembers that the last nomination meeting was also released at the Crystal Hall. And at that time, she almost died and hurt her leg.
	When Jozo comes out, Dan has driven to catch up with Jamie. The car leaves the manor and disappears soon.
	The palms she places on both sides of the wheelchair are firmly squeezed. The fingernails painted with red enamel are embedded in the flesh. But the slight pain can’t compare with her self-esteem and jealousy.
	She stays outside the villa for a long time before she returns with the wheelchair.
	No one knows what she is thinking.
	Dan is as excellent as a racing driver in driving. Soon they arrive at the Crystal Hall at the designated time.
	"Thank you." Jamie holds the phone in her hand and thanks him sincerely. She leaves these words and opens the door.
	“When will you finish?" Dan's voice is gentle and wonderful. It’s so faint that there is no emotion in it. His narrow black eyes shine with light that she can’t understand.
	When will you finish?
	A little doubt comes into Jamie's eyes. What does he mean? Does it mean that he wants to pick her up when the filming finishes?
	There is no other reason for Jamie to explain the meaning of Dan.
	"Six o'clock in the afternoon," she replies obediently, and then sees the expression on his face from the rear-view mirror. It seems not to change a lot.
	Her small mouth purses and she bites her lower lip. Her eyes roll around, "Then I will go first. Be careful on your way home."
	It’s so awkward……
	This is Jamie's only thought.
	After getting out of the car and closing the door, she doesn’t leave in a hurry but waves her small hand at Dan in the driver's seat, with a sweet smile on her small face.
	Dan sees the active and soft smile on her face from the car window, he seems to be infected that and the corners of his mouth can’t help but making a pleasant arc. When he reacts, he immediately starts the car and leaves here.
	His gaze stops on the rear-view mirror which can reflect Jamie's smile from above. It goes further away as the car kept moving.
	Jamie withdraws her swaying hand. When she sees the direction of Dan's departure, she has indeed dissatisfaction. He doesn’t even mention the matter of that night.
	Should she take the initiative?
	"Jamie, what are you thinking about?" Ryan walks from the gate of the Crystal Hall and sees Jamie standing on the stairs in a daze. Then he walks over and pats her on the shoulder.
	Jamie awakens from her thoughts and turns her head to see Ryan’s gentle and smiling face with a light smile, "I'm thinking about life."
	She would like to discuss this matter with Ryan because in her dictionary, Ryan is like her brother. He will help her whenever she has difficulties.
	But this ... doesn't seem to be good to ask?
	Jamie is confused. Then she decides that she will go to Wendy and ask. Ryan is a man after all. Telling these to him is too shameful...
	"What are you thinking about?" The smile on Ryan's face is still gentle and he leads her into the revolving door of the Crystal Hall.
	The filming location is on the rooftop of the Crystal Hall.
	With a height of more than a dozen floors, there is a short fence next to the roof. Jamie needs to stand on the roof and walks from one end to the other, holding a bottle of perfume in her hand. She needs to change a few sets of clothes in the middle.
	When Jamie and Ryan walk onto the rooftop, her small face is completely pale. She stands against the wall and dares not to pass away.
	She is afraid of heights. It’s not a joke. She will feel dizzy and is afraid of heights above the fifth floor.
	Walking by edges, she is afraid that she will accidentally get dizzy and then falls downstairs.
	"Jamie. If you're frightened, I can ask the director to change the scene." Ryan notices that Jamie has something wrong, and it reminds him that she is afraid of heights. At such a high place, she doesn’t dare to walk from the edge.
	With a small and pale face, Jamie doesn’t speak and purses her lips hard.
	She doesn’t dare. What she is most afraid of is the heights and Dan’s anger. This really can kill her.
	"What's the matter? Go to change clothes and starts filming later." The director comes over and asks when he thinks that Jamie's expression is bad. He asks a question and then he lets the two of them to quickly change their clothes.
	Ryan glances at the director, and the expression on his face was a little serious, "Director, Jamie is afraid of heights. Can you consider about changing the scene to film?"
	"What?" The director's eyes suddenly turn rounded and his volume is raised a bit, which causes the staff to look over here. "Do you know how much and how great manpower our company has spent in this scene? It can’t be changed easily. Do you think you’re playing house? "
	Ryan frowns. The project is not under his control, so he doesn't have the right to speak. Not to mention the director is appointed by the president. Even he will have to respect him.
	"If you don't want the filming, we can change people! There are no ways to change the scene!" The director answers with a firm tone and he turns to leave.
	Ryan wants to say something, but Jamie stops him. Although her small face is pale, it is still beautiful. Her eyes are also bright.
	She can't lose CR’s face. If she is replaced halfway of the filming, it is an extremely embarrassing thing.
	She doesn’t want to discredit him.
	Her heart still beats fast like a drum. She can’t calm down at all. Her fingers and legs are a little trembling.
	"If you can’t, we don't have to film. You don't force yourself." Ryan frowns. He knows Jamie's personality and she is stubborn. There are few changes in her decisions.
	However, he has seen her fear of heights. If she really goes up, it is too late to regret.
	"I'm not forcing myself. I really can do it." She pretends to smile easily, not daring to look at the edge. "Then I'll change clothes first." Picking up the clothing on the side, she walks toward the dressing room.
	Ryan is helpless and takes his clothes to the dressing room on the other side.
	Soon, Jamie changes into a light blue tulle dress. And the irregular shape fits her graceful posture. She has a good figure, which has a good balance between the slimness and overweight.
Chapter 223 As Free as the Wind
	The staff lifts her dress hem to make it easy for her to step on the stairs to the edge of the roof. The scene is already arranged and they are waiting for her.
	The roof of the crystal hall is actually not open-air. It is closed by a layer of semi-circular glass in normal times. But at this time, it is opened.
	There is a hanging garden on the rooftop. When Jamie walks from here to the end, she has to go over to the garden and put on an elf dress.
	But Jamie needs a lot of courage to even step on the stairs. It’s hard for her to walk on it.
	She grits her teeth and the uneasiness in her heart is getting heavier. Now she hasn’t stepped on it, but she has already thinks countless times in her heart, "Will I fall?" "Is there such a superman come to rescue me?" “Oh my god! Why it is so high?”
	The fine sweat covers her bright forehead and slowly flows down through her lines. It falls on the light blue dress, leaving a trace.
	She has even begun to beg God, Jesus, Jehovah, Buddha and other gods. In fact, she doesn't believe these. But at this time, she wishes to invite all those great gods.
	The more she thinks, the more heavily her heart trembles.
	Ryan looks worriedly at Jamie who is walking up step by step, frowning as if his eyebrows can squeeze a fly. He watches Jamie's movements for any seconds. He is ready to catch her immediately if she feels dizzy and accidentally falls down.
	Finally, Jamie steps on the edge of the roof. It is about one meter wide, and the marble floor is cold.
	Jamie steps on it with bare feet, and her calmness, the only thing she has when she is below, almost collapses.
	She dares not to look down.
	It seems it is the abyss below. If she looks at it, there will be a nine-headed monster rushing up and grabbing her little feet to pull her down.
	Fear spreads from the bottom of her feet to the whole body with the coldness of the floor. She was shivering. Not to mention to let her walking inside from here, she can’t even take a step.
	She wants to go down. She shouldn't force herself. If she doesn’t take this promotion, it won’t have these bad things.
	These thoughts penetrate into Jamie's mind like a tide.
	She takes a deep breath and tries to calm her mood, telling herself to walk past the rooftop just like walking normally. There is no need to fear...
	"Action!" The director orders and the filming begins.
	Jamie bites her lip fiercely and makes herself more awaken by the pain. At this time, the sun's light is not very hot and the body feels warm. But Jamie still has a cold sweat.
	She raises her eyes and visually observes the distance from here to the end. It is not close and not far away. She still wears a belt around her waist. In case that danger happens, she will not fall.
	Thinking of it, she is more confident. She cheers herself up in her heart and she slowly takes the first step.
	She steps on the icy floor, just like stepping on the clouds in the sky. She seems to walk on air and doesn’t have a sense of substance while she is dizzy.
	"Extend your hands, look at the front and make yourself as free as the wind ..." The director says to the loudspeaker while looking at the big screen.
	It's just that Jamie, who is nervous, can't pretend to have the expression of " as free as the wind " even if she tries to pretend!
	The pretty face looks so nervous and she has no way to relax. Her whole body's blood seems to coagulate, and she is extremely stiff.
	She knows that she is just a fashion designer, not a star or a model. She has no obligation to do this kind of thing. But this is Dan's task for her, and she doesn’t want to disappoint him.
	Even if she has to struggle for it, she has to fight!
	"Cut! Jamie! Why are you so stiff? You are as free as the wind, not as desperate as dying for love!" The first time is declared as failure. The director immediately shouts “Cut” and points out Jamie's mistakes.
	Jamie touches her nose, and there is a layer of sweat in her palm. In normal times, she would tell the director that she knows it. But today, her upper teeth and lower teeth are fighting. There is no way for her to say a complete sentence. .
	"Restart!" With a wave of the director's hand, Jamie walks back to the beginning point and films again.
	Jamie takes a deep breath and levels her eyes. She continues step by step. Although her calf trembles a bit, fortunately she takes a step.
	As long as the first step is taken, the rest will be much better.
	"Yes, that's it. Go slowly, and then open your hands ... The expression must be good..." The director stares at the screen closely. Ryan can’t follow Jamie all the way. Otherwise it will affect the effect of filming. So he can only watch it in the original place.
	She will be safer since there’s a belt.
	Just when she walks halfway, Jamie still can’t hold it and her feet become weak. Then she falls to the side.
	Ryan, who has been staring at her, blinks, and his legs move forward subconsciously. His body quickly rushes forward and he firmly catches Jamie when she is about to land.
	Jamie's head turns blank when she suddenly falls down. She is instantly stunned and doesn’t recover from the thrill just now.
	The height of the platform is about two or three meters from the ground. If you fall down like that, you will definitely be hurt.
	Ryan breathes a sigh of relief, and there is worry in his eyebrows. Watching at Jamie who widen her eyes and is terrified, he feels a little distressed.
	"Jamie, Jamie?" He reaches out and pats Jamie's small face, trying to recall her mind.
	"Ah?" Jamie shakes her head, remembering the scene, and she pats her chest. Oh my god, she is almost scared to death. Just now she thought that she will break her arms or legs. Fortunately, she is lucky.
	She looks back and she finds that she has walked through half of the journey!
	God, do you have to treat me in this way? She is about to succeed. Why does she suddenly make things awkward?
	"How is it? Do you hurt?" The director and staff rush over and ask about Jamie's condition.
	Jamie asks Ryan to put her down and she stands on the ground with no injuries. Just now her calf suddenly becomes weak, so she suddenly falls off.
	"It's okay, I'm fine. I can continue." Jamie smiles and her eyes are filled with bright shines, which makes people feel comfortable after seeing it.
	She wears a light-blue dress with a fishtail-shaped hem. She looks like a mermaid from the sea with agility and slyness, which is quite attracting.
	"It's okay. Don't force yourself if you can't do it." The director nods and condoles for a while. Then he continues the filming.
	Before going up this time, Jamie rubs her calf particularly so as to prevent from falling down halfway after a while. This kind of startle is enough for once. This time she is lucky and falls on the ground. The next time, if she falls from the rooftop, then she is really over.
	She clenches her fists and looks straight ahead, waiting for the director’s order for action.

Chapter 224 Blue Enchantress
	"Jamie, cheer up. If you can finish it at the noon, I will take you to eat delicious food." Ryan Jack attracts Jamie Moore’s attention with the delicious food. Jamie Moore hears the soft voice of Ryan Jack.
	Thus Jamie Moore looks aside. Her eyes are bright, and it just likes two top-level black gemstones. If Ryan Jack says this to her, he will never let her down.
	‘For delicious food, or for keeping your face, Jamie Moore, you should do it!’
	"Action!"
	When Jamie Moore thinks the delicious food, she feels that her whole body is full of energy. What appeared in her mind is hot delicious food, thus she walks and acts happily.
	Her little feet are very white, and it just likes the best lanolin. What’s more, her feet are much whiter against the black marble floor. As she moves around, the skirt of her flows, and one could see her feet partly.
	She will finish it soon…
	Jamie Moore is a little happy when she finds she will finish it. Except that she can’t look down, everything is OK.
	Ryan Jack's eyes are also full of joy, thus he loosens his fists gradually.
	"Stop! Good, this scene is good. Now you can change clothes, and then we will start the next scene!” The director stops the filming happily, and then he lets some people remove the things on the ground, and then they change the arrangement of props for the next scene.
	In the next scene, Jamie Moore still needs to walk on the rooftop. But at this time, Jamie Moore should walk with Ryan Jack. She should walk back from the end, and then give the perfume to Ryan Jack, who will walk toward her from the other end. Then they should continue to walk. Then this scene is finished.
	"It’s very good." Ryan Jack reaches out to help Jamie Moore walk down, and there is an encouraging smile on his face.
	Jamie Moore puts out her tongue, and then says with joy, "Thanks for your delicious food.”
	They look at each other with a smile, and then they go to change clothes.
	After changing clothes, the next scene begins.
	Jamie Moore has succeed in doing this thing for the first time, thus now she feels more easily in doing this thing again. As long as she doesn’t look at the appalling height downstairs of the crystal hall, there is no problem for her.
	Now she stands at the end, and Ryan Jack stands at the beginning. When the director says "Action", they begin to walk toward each other.
	At this time, Jamie Moore doesn’t need to open her arms. Instead, there is a bottle of perfume on her left hand. She walks to Ryan Jack with a smile on her face.
	Ryan Jack holds a blue enchantress in his hand. The petals of blue enchantress are still covered with crystal clear dew, which looks extremely enchanting.
	Blue enchantress?
	Jamie Moore is puzzled for a while. Then she suddenly remembers that she received a blue enchantress from a stranger once. It was just like this blue enchantress. The blue enchantress has a strong contrast with Ryan Jack's white clothes, and it has a strong visual impact.
	Who sent that blue enchantress to her at that time?
	This idea appeared in Jamie Moore’s mind。
	It can't be Ryan Jack. This flower is prepared by the staff. Besides, if it was him, why didn't he sign his name? Why did he hide this to her?
	Who was it?
	The color of the blue enchantress is very pure. The bright blue reflects into the bottom of the eyes, and it’s like a circle of whirlpool, which makes people feel dizzy.
	Jamie Moore looks at the blue enchantress all the time. Thus her eyes begin to lose their luster. She is a little puzzled, thus she walks forward subconsciously.
	It’s very dangerous at this time. What’s more, now she stands in such a high place. If she doesn’t walk forward carefully, she will pay a painful price.
	Ryan Jack finds Jamie Moore is in a trance. He is shocked. Thus he walks forward quickly. When he is about to walk to the side of Jamie Moore, a thrilling scene happens!
	Jamie Moore uses to walk in a straight line, but now she walks in a diagonal line. She is going to walk towards the roof!
	"Jamie!" Ryan Jack shuts. He throws the blue enchantress in his hand out, and then he walks toward Jamie Moore quickly.
	The floor is too slippery. It's easy to fall if you run.
	Jamie Moore shivers when she hears the shouts of Ryan Jack. Then she gets her sense, now she is only one step away from the roof!
	"Be careful!"
	Jamie Moore stands in an unsteady way, thus she falls forward. Ryan Jack arrives in time, thus he holds her arms and pulls her back, and then they take a few steps back.
	It's very wide here, and it’s enough for three people to walk shoulder by shoulder.
	"What are you doing? Are you going to die?" When the director and the staff see the thrilling scene just now, they are so scared that their hearts almost jump out of their throats. They are almost scared to death by Jamie Moore.
	Ryan Jack walks down the stairs brought by the staff with Jamie Moore in his arms. His warm eyes become cold suddenly, and then he glances at the director.
	The rising anger of the director dissipates unconsciously under the eyes of Ryan Jack. The words he wants to say stuck in his throat.
	"What happened just now?"
	"I don't know. I think she wants to jump from here. If she really jumps down from here, she probably won’t have a whole body..."
	"It’s so scared. If something bad happens to her, will our company disappear?"
	"It’s true. The fact is that we should not invite such an amateur actress. She is not a star. How could she have such ability?"
	"Maybe she gets this opportunity by the relative of her family..."
	All the staff discuss in a quiet way. They weeded out those powerful stars and models. This woman is just a designer who can only design clothes. How could the company choose her as the spokesperson of the perfume?
	There must be some dirty tricks, right? If one says that there is no trick, no one will believe this.
	Jamie Moore hears all the discussions of those people. Her face turns pale. And she bites her lips.
	She doesn’t do it on purpose. She doesn't know what’s going on. She just stares at the flower all the time. Then she suddenly loses her mind, and she almost falls down from the roof.
	It’s her fault that she is distracted at that time.
	She is almost a step away from death.
	"Well, let's have a break for 15 minutes. Please adjust yourself well before we start.” The director looks at Jamie Moore. And then he lets the people go without saying any words.
	When other people leave away, Jamie Moore drops her shoulder immediately. She wrinkles her face, and she is a little distressed.
	"I did something wrong again.” She says, and there are some frustrations at the bottom of her eyes. "Ryan, you should not ask me to be the spokesperson of the perfume. There are many people better than me."
	Even though she is frustrated, and she loses confidence in herself, she still wants to do the whole thing. If she doesn’t try it, how could she know whether she could do this or not?
	However, she has brought him a lot of trouble now.
	How could she have confidence now? Compared with this, she would rather draw a dozen of designs and make several suits.
	"What? Don’t you have confidence in yourself?" Ryan Jack puts his palm on Jamie Moore's hairy head, and then he rubs Jamie Moore’s hair as Dan William did. He rubs Jamie Moore for several times, and then he finds the touch is as the same that in his imagination.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and she doesn’t say anything. But she is very depressed.
	Ryan Jack says slowly, "Do you still remember the words you told me when we meet at first time? You told me that “Give Up” is not in your dictionary. Are you ready to give up now?"
Chapter 225 I Will Never Leave Love and Food Alone
	Jamie Moore blinks her eyes. Although she doesn't remember the time she said that word, now she seems to be motivated again.
	Just now, when she is about to fall from the roof, the figure of Ian Moore and Dan William appears in her mind.
	She never expects that Dan William has occupied such a large position in her heart.
	She will look for Dan William when the filming is over. She wants to find out the thing happened five years ago. Did he do that thing deliberately? As for this question, she must get an answer; otherwise, she will never be able to be with him without any doubts.
	"Who told you that I will give up? I'm just sighing. Don't worry. I'm Jamie Moore." Jamie Moore says with a confident smile…
	Ryan Jack is in a trance, “I always believe you."
	He always believes her. As long as she wants to do something, she will succeed in the thing.
	Because she is Jamie Moore.
	She has left so much warmth in his life.
	…
	It soon comes to the noon, and Jamie Moore’s performance is getting better and better, and the director also looks at Jamie Moore with appreciation.
	Jamie Moore signs. The rest time of the noon is only one hour. But it’s enough for Jamie Moore to adjust herself for the difficult challenges in the afternoon.
	"Let's go. And we will have some delicious food now." Ryan Jack puts his hand on Jamie Moore’s shoulder naturally, and then they leave the Crystal Hall.
	In fact, this scene seems to be OK, but it’s photographed by someone deliberately.
	Although Ryan Jack just comes back, he still knows where there is delicious food.
	At this time, he brings her to a Chinese restaurant.
	Jamie Moore has been in China longer than Ryan Jack, but she doesn’t know that there is such a restaurant here. Thus she looks around curiously.
	Ryan Jack has booked the box in advance.
	When the waiter puts the food on the table, Jamie Moore wants to eats the food immediately. Then she begins to eat after telling Ryan Jack.
	Jamie Moore always eats in a quick and rude way. Ryan Jack has seen Jamie Moore eating in such a way. But when he looks at such scene, he will have a good appetite and he will be in a good mood.
	"You could eat slowly, don't worry. Ryan Jack says softly.
	In fact, Ryan Jack has never hided his feeling toward Jamie Moore. But Jamie Moore is so stupid, and she doesn’t understand it.
	Jamie Moore eats happily, and she doesn’t hear Ryan Jack’s words. She nods foolishly as she eats delicious food.
	Jamie Moore is a woman who will never leave love and food alone!
	She sighs in her heart with satisfaction.
	The decoration here is elegant and retro, and every dish has a good taste. Now she only regrets why she doesn't find this place earlier.
	Jamie Moore finishes eating after half of food on the table disappeared. Then she narrows her eyes like a lazy cat, with an appreciative smack of her lips.
	"Are you full?" The warm voice of Ryan Jack comes.
	Jamie Moore shivers after hearing the words of Jamie Moore. Then she finds almost all the food on the table has been eaten by her. However, Ryan Jack almost doesn’t eat anything.
	Jamie Moore feels embarrassed. She looks at Ryan Jack awkwardly, and then she sits up straightly. Then she says in an unnatural way, "Maybe we should order another food. It seems that you don’t eat anything..."
	Ryan Jack looks at her with a smile, “Well.”
	Then he calls the waiter to remove the food on the table, and then orders some other food. Then he begins to eat.
	Although Jamie Moore has eaten much food just now, she is greedy when she sees that Ryan Jack is eating. So she picks up the fruit platter and eats the fruit slowly.
	They are going to go back to the Crystal Hall after eating. But they don't expect that they would meet Dan William, who has dinner with his customers here.
	Jamie Moore stops for a while, and then she looks at Dan William who walks from bamboo layers. He is talking with people around him. He is very calm, and now he is very serious. He is waiting the answer of people around him after finishing his words.
	Jamie Moore is shocked by this unconsciously. Even when Dan William walks to the front of them, she doesn’t realize it.
	"Mr. William." Ryan Jack nods at Ryan Jack. Then he pulls Jamie Moore, which wakes Jamie Moore up immediately.
	Jamie Moore wants to say hello to him, but Dan William just nods at Ryan Jamie. And then he looks forward directly. And then he leaves without looking at Jamie Moore.
	She is ignored.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She looks at the back of Dan William, and she is a little sad. Is she thin? So he couldn’t see her.
	"Let's go." A few moments later, Ryan adjusts his mood well, and then he says.
	"Well." Jamie Moore nods and then leaves the restaurant with him.
	Dan William, who has lunch with his customer, leaves with his secretary, and then they go to the park lot.
	His face is so gloomy that no one dares to speak with him, and no one dares to break this atmosphere.
	She has been Dan William's secretary for a long time, thus she naturally knows why Dan William is angry at the moment.
	This is because of Jamie Moore. Just now, the president saw the woman he loves is staying with another man at that restaurant. Even though he doesn’t say anything, he must feel very sad.
	"Get out of the car." Dan William glances at Secretary Sam coldly. His black eyes are sharp and cold like hawks and falcons. He presses his thin rose lips. The atmosphere in the carriage drops to freezing point.
	Secretary Sam shivers, and then she leaves the car quickly. As soon as she closes the door, the car rushes out like an arrow out of the string.
	…
	Jamie Moore stands on the edge of the roof. The props and lights are ready. She wears a dark blue, irregular skirt. The breeze blows her skirt like blowing across the sea, stirring layers of spoondrift.
	At this scene, Jamie Moore needs to walk from here to the end with her eyes closed, and then she should jumps up from the edge, and lands steadily with the help of the belt. Then she will wear the elves' clothes, and perform the last scene in the hanging garden. After doing all of these, the filming will be finished.
	Jamie Moore shivers when she thinks of this.
	It's hard for her to walk from here with her eyes open, but now she has to walk from here with her eyes closed.
	When people close their eyes, they will lose their sense of balance. Even though she can walk on the flat ground, she may not be able to walk in a straight route. Let alone she should walk in such a high place with her eyes closed.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and then she holds the bottle of fragrance in her hand tightly. If it’s not for the relationship between the company and Ryan Jack, she may doubt that someone is making troubles with her, thus he comes up with such a filming planning.
	It’s bold and exciting. But at the same time, it’s also thrilling.
	When the promotional film is released, it will certainly catch the audience's eyes.
	However, if one is careless, maybe he will lose his life before bring surprise to the audience.
	Jamie Moore touches the belt at her waist to make sure there is no problem. She breathes heavily in the bottom of her heart. Now she wants to cry, but she could never shrink back at this time.
	Maybe she can take this opportunity to cure her acrophobia…
	"Start now!" Jamie Moore adjusts her action after hearing the word of Jamie Moore. She closes her eyes completely. The camera is put in a close range, so it’s unacceptable for her to open her eyes to look at the road.
	
Chapter 226 Accident
	She walks forward slowly. One step… and two steps… She walks in a shaky way. But she has tried all her effort to do this.
	Seeing Jamie Moore walks in a shivering and shaky way, the director doesn’t stop her. Even those stars dare not to do this kind of dangerous action. If Jamie Moore walks for several times, maybe she will reach the effect the director wants.
	Jamie Moore continues to walk forward, and she feels that she is walking on the clouds. It seems that she is floating on the sky and she feels that her legs are soft. Every step is very difficult for her.
	“Please walk in a straight way. Please walk in a straight way. Please walk in a straight way.”
	She closes her eyes tightly and hypnotizes herself constantly in her heart. Fortunately, her sense of balance is not too bad. Although she doesn’t walks in a straight way, and she wears a stiff expression on her face, she does not deviate from her position.
	Everyone would be afraid if he has to stand on such a high place, and walk on it with eyes closed. Jamie Moore is not an exception, but she never puts fear on her face. Instead, she worries in her heart. She is worried about whether she can complete the filming.
	She represents the image of the whole CR.
	The wind blows on her cheek and brings her hair beside the cheek to her ears. The cloth on her body is soft and delicate, which makes her feel comfortable. This makes her feel relaxed.
	With this, she is gradually relaxed. She wears a comfortable expression on her face and waits the close shot of the camera.
	When the critical moment comes, Jamie Moore has walked to the end of the position. Then she opens her eyes slowly. She slightly turns her body, and then the waist belt lifts her whole body to the air. With the rise of hanging wire, Jamie Moore tiptoes and then jumps from the edge.
	Hanging wire hoists her highly. At that moment, Jamie Moore could look down at the roof below from the sky. If she looks around, she could see the scenery beyond the roof.
	This is really difficult. Props and safety measures must be well arranged to avoid accidents.
	The director claps for Jamie Moore. This scene is perfect, and the filming of this scene passes in a time. It saves the time of acting again.
	When the camera is filming the scene that Jamie Moore is in a high sky, Ryan Jack walks to the garden after receiving the signal of the director.
	The aerial shot lasts about 20 seconds, and then hanging wire puts Jamie Moore down gradually, thus Jamie Moore is getting closer and closer to the roof.
	But the hanging wire doesn’t put Jamie Moore on the ground safely. The screw on it is loose, thus the rope on hanging wire keeps sliding. Thus Jamie Moore, who is in the air, loses her support and drops down quickly.
	"Ah!"
	Then someone exclaims. Jamie Moore wants to catch something, but she is in the air, and she can’t catch anything. Thus she drops downs quickly.
	“It’s too terrible, and I will die. It’s so bad.” Jamie thinks.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes tightly. She presses her lips bitterly, and she is ready to suffer the pain.
	Other people will be popular after they make a movie. And then they will have money they want. However, she will die before she is popular.
	At that time, someone rushes toward Jamie Moore, and even the staff doesn’t see it clearly. A figure rush to Jamie Moore quickly when Jamie Moore is about to drop to the ground. That man holds Jamie Moore in his arms, and then they roll on the ground for several times before they leave each other alone.
	Jamie Moore is a little dizzy. Her eyes are hazy; she can't see the scene clearly. She doesn't know who is holding her in his arms, and she only smells a light lavender fragrance.
	Who saves her?
	She wants to open her eyes to see the people in front of her, but several busy and anxious voices resound in her ears. She can’t speak anything. She rolls her eyes and then she faints.
	The ambulance stops at the gate of the Crystal Museum. A few people know that the propaganda film is filmed here except the staff members. They block the news as soon as there is an accident. Otherwise, if the news of the incident leaks out, the propaganda film would be forced to be suspended before it starts.
	…
	The smell of disinfectants in the hospital is very heavy, which lingers in the nose. What people sees is white, which makes people feel cool.
	White is not only the color of angels, but also the color of Chinese funeral.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t get hurt very much, and only the skin around her arm is worn. Compared with the man who saves her, she is much better.
	"Mommy, Mommy seems to wake up!" The soft and waxy voice resounds in Jamie Moore’s ear. Jamie Moore, who lies on the bed, frowns, and then she open her eyes.
	What come into her eyes are the worried face of Ian Moore and the cold and angry face of Dan William.
	"I…What's the matter?" Jamie Moore asks in a hoarse way. She is a little confused, and she looks at her hands coated with liquid medicine. She doubts about this.
	She remembers that she was filming. Then she rose to the sky, and looked at the landscape on the ground from the sky. But when she was about to land…
	The fact is that the screw was loosened, and then the rope got out of control, so the belt at her waist slipped, thus she almost fell to the ground.
	It seems that someone has rushed to her and saved her. Who is that person?
	"Mommy, don't worry. You just suffer some minor injuries. You can leave the hospital today." Ian Moore smiles at her. But the smile on her face is a little reluctant.
	Jamie Moore wants to say something. But Dan William, who stands beside her, can’t keep calm anymore. He stares at Jamie Moore coldly.
	"You are clear that you are afraid of heights. Why do you film the scene? Your life is so worthless that you can spend it freely, right?"
	His voice is a little bit colder than usual. It seems that it is filled with ice dregs. It can pierce people's wounds invisibly. It sounds that he is a little irritated.
	Jamie Moore just wakes up, thus she is a little confused. What’s more, the situation is critical just now, and she is dizzy now, so she doesn't understand the words of Dan William suddenly.
	Thus she thinks that Dan William is scolding her.
	"Why are you so fierce? Can I control accidents? What's more, it’s you who let me to film for this. Why do you scold me now?" Jamie Moore presses her lips. She rubs her aching temples, and then says rudely.
	Ian Moore shrinks his neck, and he glances at Jamie Moore first, and then he looks at Dan William whose face is very cold. The atmosphere in the ward depends on Dan William’s mood.
	"Okay, then you'll have to stay in the office and you can’t go anywhere in the future." He presses his lips with a cold face. Then he looks at Jamie Moore in a self-mocking way. He suppresses the heartache in his heart, and then leaves away after finishing his words.
	"What? What do you mean?" Jamie Moore raises her head immediately. She looks at the leaving back of Dan William, and she is pondering about the meaning of this sentence.
	She can’t go anywhere?
	Does it mean that she should stop filming?
	"Mommy, daddy is very worried about you. As soon as he heard that mommy is sent to the hospital, he rushes to here immediately." Ian Moore pouts, and he can feel that Dan William is a little sad.
	“…” Jamie Moore presses her lips. She feels warmth in her heart. It seems that he still cares about her.
	But how could the hanging wire break suddenly? Before that, the staff has checked it. And there is no problem with the hanging wire. Thus they ask her to act.
Chapter 227 Telepathy between the Mother and Her Child
	How could the screw loosen suddenly?
	How could she be so unlucky?
	"Go and catch up with your father, and then you can tell him that a great man rarely stoops to pettiness or harbors grievance for past wrongs. If he gets angry, he will have wrinkle." Jamie Moore pats on Ian Moore’s shoulder. She murmurs beside his ear, and then laughs.
	"Okay." Ian Moore immediately agrees. Then he says, “Mommy, don't you go to see the godfather?"
	"What's the matter?" Jamie Moore frowns. There is a light flashes in her mind, and then she suddenly reminds of something.
	"In order to save you, now Godfather is still in the ICU…Mommy, slow down.” As soon as Ian Moore finishes the first sentence, Jamie More throws away her quilt and puts on her shoes, and then runs out.
	Ian Moore shakes his head, and he presses his lips. Then he walks out of the ward, and catches Dan William who is ready to enter the elevator.
	Ian Moore has an intuition that this accident is not like an ordinary accident. Maybe it's the telepathy between the mother and her child. He always feels that this thing is not so simple.
	It's likely that someone plan it on purpose.
	It’s just like the one who kidnaps him. He can’t find out the man behind the accident until now. Does it mean…
	The expression on Ian Moore’s face is a little bit bad. He dares not to think more. If what he thinks is true, the man behind the accident will give them a heavy blow and bring them big troubles without any hint!
	Such a man is more dangerous than any enemy.
	"Daddy." Ian Moore hides the sadness on his face, and then he runs toward Dan William. He holds Dan William’s big hand with his small hand, though he can just hold one figure of Dan William.
	Dan William feels a touch of warmth in the palm of his hand. He holds Ian Moore with his hand, and then walks forward with him.
	"What's the matter?" Now there is no anger in his eyes. Instead, there’s a trace of warmth in his eyes, and he feels very satisfied.
	This is his son. Whenever he thinks of these, he feels that all the regrets in his life have been eliminated.
	Children are really amazing. In his opinion, although Ian Moore is very different from other children, he always plays cute in front of him and Jamie Moore, which is not different from ordinary children.
	What’s more, Ian Moore looks like him. When he stands in front of him, he would feel that he is just a reproduction of himself.
	He wants to give Jamie Moore and Ian Moore a proper identity. He wants to take Jamie Moore as his wife, and take Ian Moore as his son. But if Jamie Moore doesn't want to marry him, will Ian Moore stay with him? However, it's impossible for him to let Jamie Moore and Ian Moore run away again.
	"Mommy told me that Daddy should not be angry. She doesn’t do this in purpose. If Daddy gets angry, you will not be handsome. Mommy likes the smile of daddy." Ian Moore blinks his big black grape eyes cunningly, and he says such words in a calm way.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t say these words. What Jamie Moore says is “he should not get angry, otherwise, he will have wrinkle on his face”. But when Ian Moore delivers her words to Dan William, he says all the idea in Jamie Moore’s mind to Dan William.
	If Jamie Moore hears this, will she slap his little ass?
	Bad boy, why are you so smart?
	Dan William is moved, and the coldness on his eyes disappears gradually. He looks at Ian Moore pleasantly, "Is that what she said?"
	"Of course, Mommy asks me to tell this to Daddy." Ian Moore sells Jamie Moore without hesitation. He knows that it’s impossible for Dan William to ask Jamie Moore in person. So no matter what he says, Jamie Moore would not know this.
	It's true that they are father and son. And it’s also true that Ian Moore is more cunning than his father.
	Handsome Ian Moore is complacent in his heart. He is really mommy's best assistant. Such a few words can make daddy's anger go away and it even could enhance their relationships. He is so intelligent
	Dan William presses his lips, but one still could see the smile on the corner of Dan William’s face. His face is very handsome, and he still keeps calm. But the warmth and tenderness appear in his eyes.
	"Let's go back." Dan William picks Ian Moore up, and then he rubs against his soft face.
	Ian Moore doesn't reject the action of Dan William at all. He feels itch on his face, thus he can't help giggling.
	"No, daddy." Ian Moore suddenly remembers that his mommy has gone to the ward of his godfather. If daddy goes to the ward at this time, he would be annoyed by mommy again. He couldn't let him go.
	Dan William looks at Ian Moore doubtfully. Ian Moore rolls his big eyes and says, "Mommy needs to have a rest. She is sleeping now. Daddy, I am hungry, and I want to eat some delicious food."
	Ian Moore says these words and acts that he really wants to eat something.
	Ian Moore is very guilty. But in order to facilitate the relationship between his father and mother, he needs to tell a white lie. Anyway, he is a child, and he is not afraid of being punished for telling a lie.
	Ian Moore feels more relaxed when he thinks of here.
	Dan William thinks for a while, and then he nods. He looks at Ian Moore sweetly, “What do you want to eat? Daddy will take you to eat now.”
	“I want to…”
	They walk away in a good mood, which is different from Jamie Moore who stands beside the ICU.
	Ryan Jack is lying in the ICU with an oxygen mask. According to the words of doctor, his brain is oppressed, so he couldn't wake up for a while. His chest is hit by a heavy object, and two ribs of him have been broken. There are several wounds on his hands and feet, which is very serious. Fortunately, the rescue is timely, thus there is no threat to his life.
	Hit by a heavy object…
	Jamie Moore holds her hands tightly. Ryan Jack saved her life, thus he lies in the ICU now. She almost fell on the ground at that time, it was Ryan Jack who rushed to her, and saved the life of her.
	She is only slightly injured, but Ryan Jack almost died.
	There is guilt and uneasiness on Jamie Moore’s face. She stands beside the door of Ward. She looks at the man on the bed through the window. Ryan Jack always wears a warm smile on his face, but now there are several scars on his face. He looks pale, as if he would break into pieces when someone touches him.
	She never sees him in such a bad way. She wants to enter the room to see him. But here is the ICU, and she can’t enter the room.
	If Dan William doesn’t save her when she falls down on the ground at that time, everything would be OK. At least now it's her who is lying on that bed. It's her who is suffering from those pains. In this way, she won't feel so guilty.
	Ryan Jack…Why are you so stupid?
	Even though they are friends, he doesn’t need to do this. If she falls down from that height, the worst thing is that she will lie on the hospital for several months, and there is no threat to her life.
	If Ryan Jack is awake, he will laugh at her innocence.
	She stands ar the door for a while. Jamie Moore walks around, but she still doesn’t want to leave here. Instead, she walks to the seat in front of the ward door. She sits down, and lowers her head. Her curly eyelashes hide the emotion at the bottom of her eyes.
Chapter 228 Supremacy
	She needs to wait until he is awake.
	Only in this way can she feel less guilty.
	At the same time, someone leaks the video of the accident of the Crystal Hall. So At the gate of the Star Company, many reporters come here and block the way. Fortunately, they don't know which hospital Jamie Moore and Ryan Jack are in, thus this prevents the riot in the hospital.
	The Star is deeply troubled by the leaking. It's clear that they have blocked the news. Who leaks this news out?
	Soon, the event is published in the major newspaper, occupying the leading position. As a result, the Star is ordered to stop filming, which causes huge losses.
	When Ian Moore and Dan William hear this news, they are eating food. When Ian Moore wants to ask Dan William to help the Star, Dan William just makes a phone call, and then he easily solves this matter.
	Dan William is supremacy in Country C. Even in abroad, he always has his own power. In Country C, almost no one dares to disobey him.
	So when Dan William gives a phone call to a newspaper company, and requests them to stop selling today's newspapers, and asks them to tell this news to other newspaper companies, they agree without hesitation.
	They do all of this quickly.
	Comparing with this kind of headline, which has a little profit, and which could be published by all newspaper companies, his own company is more important. So the head of the newspaper company agrees without any hesitation.
	The reason why Dan William helps the Star is very simple.
	Ryan Jack is the director of the Star Company. What’s more, he saves Jamie Moore’s life. So he needs to help the Star at this time.
	Maybe it's just because he doesn’t want Jamie Moore to owe other men anything.
	After eating, Dan William asks Derek William to send Ian Moore to the villa, and he returns back to the hospital.
	But when he walks to the ward, he finds Jamie Moore is not in the ward.
	He looks around the ward, and he looks at the messy quilt and his eyes turns black.
	It seems that he has known where Jamie Moore is.
	If he is right, Jamie Moore must be in the ward of Ryan Jack.
	Sure enough, Dan William frowns when he sees Jamie Moore who falls asleep on the seat of Ryan Jack’s ward. Then he walks toward her quickly, and stands beside her.
	"Get up." Dan William frowns and then he gently pushes Jamie Moore who is sleeping. There is a touch of helplessness and bitterness at the bottom of his eyes.
	How could she sleep at here? Doesn’t she afraid that she will have a fever?
	Jamie Moore doesn’t fall asleep completely. Thus she wakes up when Dan William pushes her. She stands up, and rubs her eyes, and then she looks at Dan William with yawning.
	"What are you doing here?" He asks.
	"I'll wait here until he wakes up." Jamie Moore says unhappily. Whenever she thinks that someone is injured for saving her, and this people even almost loses his life, she feels very upset.
	What’s more, she has such a good relationship with Ryan Jack, and he is a good friend of her.
	Dan William presses his red lips. Then he puts his hands on Jamie Moore’s head, and rubs her hair. It seems that he is comforting her. He knows that it’s Ryan Jack who saves her. It’s understandable that she feels guilty. When Jozo saves his life in the past, he also feels guilty, and he wants to compensate Jozo.
	But...Does this mean that Jamie Moore loves Ryan Jack?
	What Jamie Moore said in the party on that day is just like a thorn which stabs in the heart of Dan William, and his eyes are full of bitterness.
	Does she really love Ryan Jack?
	"Do you love him?" Jamie Moore keeps silent for a while, and then he asks directly. The cold voice of Dan William resounds in the empty corridor, and there is a touch of imperceptible tension in his voice.
	If she really loves Ryan Jack, what would Dan William do?
	Let her go or force her to stay beside him?
	Jamie Moore raises her head, and then she looks at the clear eyes of Dan William with doubt, “Love who?”
	"Ryan Jack." Dan William looks at the man who lies on the bed, and he even expects that he is the man who lies in the ward. In this way, will she always keep him in her heart?
	He sniffs helplessly in his heart. He puts his hand on Jamie Moore’s head, and then he holds his hand tightly, and his eyes are full of nervousness.
	In the ICU, there are special nurses who keep guard all the time to prevent emergency and accidents.
	Ryan Jack's father is in country C, but Ryan Jack seldom tells the thing happened in his family to Jamie Moore. Even when he is in England, he spends most of his time with Ian Moore and her. She never sees Ryan Jack return back to country C, as if he is a native Englishman.
	He seldom tells the things in his family to Jamie Moore. Although Jamie Moore knows his father is in the Country C, she has no way to contact his father.
	The son is seriously injured and is now staying in the hospital, but his father doesn’t know this. They don’t have a good relationship, do they?
	Ryan Jack is always a considerate man, but now he lies on the bed quietly. Jamie Moore feels bad, thus she doesn’t hear the question of Dan William clearly.
	"What?" She raises her head slightly. She pulls her sight back from the glass window of the ward, and then she looks at Dan William.
	"Nothing." Dan William presses his lips unconsciously. The atmosphere around him is very cold. It’s true that she stays close with him, but Jamie Moore has a feeling that the distance between them is quite far away.
	The corridor is very quiet. Jamie Moore is worried about the safety of Ryan Moore, thus she doesn’t find the abnormality of Dan William.
	Dan William withdraws his hands and then he puts his hand into his pocket. He holds his hands tightly. He is still very cool, as if he has never been alone.
	"I'll go back first." Dan William says in a low voice. He looks at Jamie Moore who focuses her sight on the Ryan Jack who lies on the bed, and then he sneers, and walks away.
	Jamie Moore is a little stunned. She wants to say something, but she doesn’t know how to say.
	Tonight, Dan William is a little strange.
	But she doesn’t know why he looks strange.
	It is clear that happiness is at your fingertips, but you throw it away and give it to other people.
	…
	In the next day, Wendy knows that Jamie Moore is injured from the news. So she goes to the hospital with some favorite dishes of Jamie Moore in her hand at noon.
	There are several reporters crouching at the door of the hospital. They hear the news, thus they come here. Everyone wants to get the headlines. So these journalists are not stupid and won’t share the news with other newspapers.
Chapter 229 Exceptions
	However, the men of Dan William also guard at the entrance of the hospital. All the entrances of the hospital are guarded. These reporters are urgent to get the latest news, but they can't get into the hospital.
	If Wendy knows what will happen at the gate of hospital, she will not go to the hospital at this time.
	Because she meets Duke Field who accompanies his girlfriend to the hospital.
	No one knows his girlfriend better than her.
	Because she and his girlfriend have known each other for a long time, and it is even longer than the time she knows Jamie Moore.
	The name of his girlfriend is Joey Lan. His girlfriend is very smart and beautiful, and looks like a good girl. She has the same temperament as other Miss of the noble family. She is pampered and willful. The reason why they know each other is the cooperation between the Lan Family and the Wendy Family. Thus they become friends.
	They are schoolmates in the junior high school, and they study at the same high school. But then the relationship between them has fades gradually.
	Bruce Hill tells her that Duke Field falls in love with Joey Lan since he was in the high school, but Joey Lan never accepts his dating.
	Duke Field is very indifferent, and it seems that he doesn’t have any interest in anything, but Joey Lan is an exception.
	His emotion matches his personality, which is deep and quiet. If Bruce Hill never sees that Duke Field has a date with Joey Lan, he doesn’t know that they are in love.
	Since he can hide their relationship for such a long time, he is really patient.
	That’s true that if Duke Field doesn’t tell this thing to them, no one will know that they have fallen in love with each other.
	If she doesn’t meet Joey Lan who is waiting for Duke Field on the side of the road that night, Wendy wouldn't know this neither.
	It's said that Joey Lan goes to America for further study after college, so Duke Field has waited for her for several years. Joey Lan just returns in recent days.
	Wendy holds the plastic bag in her hand, which causes a red mark on her arms. It’s very painful, but Wendy doesn’t have any feelings. She stands still to look at the two people in the distance.
	She never sees such a gentle expression on Duke Field’s face. It seems that the warmth could melt other people.
	He puts his hand on the belly of Joey Lan, and then she strokes it softly. Then he talks to her from time to time, and Joey Lan smiles happily. The scene is very warm.
	Wendy feels that she has lost all her strength, and what leaves behind is weakness and disappointment.
	Wendy remembers it’s Joey Lan who leads to the bad relationship between Wendy and Duke Field now.
	Jamie Moore knows the secret that she loves Duke Field. However, she knows about this secret by peeping into her diary.
	But Wendy never thinks that her best friend - Joey Lan would become the girlfriend of the man she loved.
	It's ridiculous and cruel.
	If it isn't for that thing, she might have been cheated by the sweet face of Joey Lan all the time. And she also has a bad relationship with Duke Field because of this thing.
	It's ridiculous that she doesn’t know why Duke Field is so angry. Now, she knows it’s all because of Joey Lan.
	He loves Joey Lan.
	Wendy feels that someone is stabbing her heart with a knife, and then this person pulls the knife out fiercely. The blood flows. Wendy feels depressed, and it’s hard for her to breathe.
	"Wendy, why are you in the hospital?" Joey Lan and Duke Field walks to the front of Wendy when Wendy is in a trance.
	Joey Lan wears a sweet and happy smile on her face. She holds Duke Field’s arms, and her eyes are full of pride.
	"Oh, I come here to see a friend. Why are you here?" Wendy has stayed with Jamie Moore for a long time. She doesn’t learn nothing except how to pretend stupid and calm from Jamie Moore well. She looks as usual, and it seems that she is surprised to see them here.
	Duke Field looks at Wendy and nods. Then he looks at Joey Lan again.
	Wendy’s heart feels pain when she sees the action of Duke Field. She still wears a smile on her face, and her eyes are full of sadness.
	"Duke Field takes me to the see doctor here. You know that I have a bad stomach." Joey Lan smiles sweetly, and then she rubs Joey Lan’s arm with her face intimately.
	Duke Field smiles helplessly. Then he rubs Joey Lan’s hair sweetly and naturally, as if he had practiced this action for countless times.
	"Well." Wendy says with a pale face.
	Joey Lan looks at the expression of Joey Lan, and then she looks at Wendy in a gloating way.
	Thanks to Wendy, she became the girlfriend of Duke Field.
	"Since you're going to see friends, we won't disturb you. We can have dinner together in the future." Joey Lan puts her hands on Duke Field’s pocket after finishing the word, and then she leaves with Duke Filed with a smile on her face.
	From beginning to end, Duke Field only sees Wendy for one time.
	Wendy feels sad when she looks at the leaving back of them.
	She still expects that Duke Field is just toying with Joey Lan in the past.
	But now, all the flukes have turned into a vicious slap, which slaps her hardly.
	It’s the first time for Wendy to like a man so much. From high school to now, she gives the most beautiful youth in her life to this boy - Duke Field.
	But the love is over before it starts. What’s more, Duke Field even doesn’t know she loves him. She is kicked out without any signals.
	She suddenly wants to cry, and she wants to cry right in here! She wants to throw all the secrets and feelings buried in her heart in these years out. But she can just blink her eyes, and then turns away numbly.
	In fact, she is an outgoing girl. Her character is warm and proud. She is proud of her family. But she is nothing in front of Duke Field.
	Ryan Jack still doesn’t wake up, and Dan William doesn’t return back to the hospital again. Jamie Moore knows from Secretary Sam that Dan William takes a flight to the United States last night for business. He would come back two days later.
	But what makes Jamie Moore angry is that he goes on a business trip without saying a word. Does she do something wrong?
	There is a strict visiting time limit in the ICU, and Jamie Moore can’t enter the ICU in the rest of the time. Although Ryan Jack doesn’t wake up, she is not discouraged, and she insists on waiting for him to wake up in the hospital.
	It’s almost 12 o'clock when Jamie Moore leaves from the door of the ward. She is ready to have lunch in the restaurant downstairs.
	As soon as she walks to the corridor, she meets Wendy who is numb at the moment.
	"What's the matter with you, Wendy? Are you being rubbed?" Seeing Wendy is in a bad mood, Jamie Moore asks.
	In usual times, she should runs to her and hugs her. Then she will ask why she is in the hospital? Now she is so quiet, and it’s rare to see this.
	"Nothing, I bring some delicious food to you.” Wendy shakes her head. She doesn’t let the mood of her affect Jamie Moore. After all, she just suffer an accident. It's not good to let Jamie Moore worry about the things of her again.
	Jamie Moore looks at her with doubt, and then she presses her lips, “Where is the food?”
	“Here.” Wendy hands the thing in her right hand to Jamie Moore. She subconsciously clenches her fingers, but she finds there is nothing in her hand.
	
Chapter 230 Make Love with Him Bravely
	"Are you kidding me? Do you want me to eat air?" Jamie Moore sneers, and she thinks Wendy is kidding her.
	In this way, there is probably something happened to Wendy.
	Wendy blinks her eyes. She almost cries when she looks at the empty hand of her. She holds the food in her hand just now. Where is it?
	Wait! She goes to the toilet just now. She throws the towel into the trash can when she comes out. Maybe it’s that time...
	Wendy almost wants to kill herself. What the hell it is? How could she throw such a heavy thing in her hand to garbage?
	"Well, it's time for lunch. Let's go. It's my treat today..." In order to hide the feelings in her heart, Wendy, who is as mean as Jamie Moore, decides to treat Jamie Moore today.
	"Is the sun rise in the West and set in the East today? Do you want to poison me?" Jamie Moore says in a joking way, and then walks into the elevator with Wendy.
	It’s such a rare opportunity. So Jamie Moore decides that she will eat something good to satisfy her empty stomach.
	There is a famous restaurant on the opposite side of the hospital. The food there has a good taste and is mainly spicy. Both Jamie Moore and Wendy like spicy food, so they sit down in the restaurant on the second floor.
	"Be mercy to me. I don't bring much money when I go out today. If you eat too much, I'll have to sell you to the restaurant to pay the bill!" Wendy takes her wallet out and then she counts the money in it. The money is enough for Jamie Moore and her to eat, but the premise is that Jamie Moore doesn’t eat too much.
	Once, Jamie Moore and she went to eat hot pot near the school secretly. Jamie Moore ate so much, and the bill was more than the money she brought. What’s more, at that time, Jamie Moore seldom brought money with her when she went out, because Dan William would prepare it, thus they were almost detained by the boss and might have to wash dishes.
	Finally, she took a risk to calling Dan William. Then Dan William took Jamie Moore away with a bad mood after clearing the bill.
	Then Jamie Moore asked for two days off. It’s said that she was ill.
	Hearing this, Wendy dared not to leave the classroom casually for fear of being beaten to death by Dan William.
	She found the truth when she went to the Moore Family to see Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore was not beaten by Dan William, but punished by him.
	Dan William asked Jamie Moore to run around the villa for two rounds, and then he took her to the gym, forcing her to do exercise for several hours. He said the aim was to eliminate the toxins in the body, which was good for health.
	Bah!
	It was so horrible. Jamie Moore couldn’t stand up for several days after doing all of this. When she took a step forward, it seemed like that she was kneeling down to greet the one in front of her. Wendy also laughed at her for a long time, saying that she is the incarnation of a little mermaid.
	Since then, they had been obedient for a long time. And they dare not to go out to eat and drink. Wendy also taught Jamie Moore a way. If Dan William gets angry with her or punishes her, she can hug him tightly. In this way, Dan William would not be angry.
	It’s very useful.
	"Who you think I am? Don't worry, I don't eat much." Jamie Moore blinks and then she looks at the picture on the menu with a greedy expression.
	Wendy presses her lips and thinks, “If I believe you, I would have died!”
	"Jamie Moore, how about you and Mr. William? When will you give birth to a little sister to Bunny?" Wendy picks the menu on her hands and then asks.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips bitterly. And then she orders the food she loved to the waiter. Then she says, “There’s not even a grass in my belly, let alone a baby.
	Jamie Moore feels bad when she thinks this thing. She feels that Dan William is a man who will abandon her when he has slept with her. He doesn’t say anything to her until now!
	Does she need to have sex with him again?
	"Have you done something bad to Dan William?” Wendy looks at her with doubt. And then she hands the menu to the waiter.
	"Am I that kind of person?" Jamie Moore stares at her fiercely. She's a little confused. She doesn't do anything. What's wrong with him?
	Wendy knows that something must happen, when she looks at the expression of Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore is such a stupid woman. Dan William is angry, but she still doesn’t know the reason. She just thinks over it in her heart, what could she figure out by thinking it alone?
	Wendy feels that Dan William is so pitiful. There are so many beautiful women, how could Dan William love such a stupid one?
	"What's going on?" Wendy blinks her eyes, and then she looks at her with expectation.
	Jamie Moore presses his lips, and then she is ready to tell everything about her sorrowful love to Wendy. But she is stopped by someone.
	"Wendy, what a coincidence! It's so lucky to meet you here." Joey Lan sits at the another table with Duke Field, and then she sees Wendy, thus she holds Duke Field’s arms and walks to say hello with them.
	Jamie Moore swallows the words, and then she turns to looks at Joey Lan.
	She finally makes up her mind to tell everything to Wendy. So she is a little sad when she is stopped by somebody.
	Joey Lan also sees Jamie Moore, thus she is surprised. Then she asks, “Is this Jamie Moore?”
	Jamie Moore is popular when she was in the middle school. She will be the focus whenever she appears. Even Joey Lan is envious about her.
	She has a good family background, and she is beautiful. What’s more, Dan William treats her very well. Everyone is envious of this.
	“Hello.” Jamie Moore smiles, and then she nods to Joey Lan politely.
	She looks at Wendy, and then she finds she looks pale. Then she suddenly understands what’s happening.
	This girl is the girlfriend of Duke Field, is she right? It’s true that she is beautiful. But is she a perfect nmatch for Duke Field?
	Wendy once told Jamie Moore that this woman is very outstanding. She is the right woman for Duke Field. But now she thinks that it's all bullshit.
	Jamie Moore feels that the reason why Wendy says that is that Duke Field loves this woman. So this woman becomes an outstanding one in the eyes of Wendy, thus she could match Duke Field well.
	So she once told Wendy, she would rather that Wendy was fallen in love with Bruce Hill, who was careless and looked stupid, than seeing her falling in love with this cold Duke Field, who brought her both physical and mental sufferings.
	"Hello, my name is Joey Lan, I am the girlfriend of Duke." Joey Lan reaches out her hand to Jamie Moore and says sweetly.
	Is this the so-called woman in love?
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and she shakes hand with Joey Lan with a smile on her face.
	Duke Field looks at Jamie Moore, and he doesn’t say anything.
	Compared with Duke Field, Dan William is just cold in appearance, but he is determined in loving Jamie Moore. His love is domineering. And he can't tolerate any flaws in his love. However, he often breaks his rules because of Jamie Moore.
	He never shows his love with words, but he shows it with actions. And he will never let her go easily. Even though Dan William thinks Jamie Moore loves Ryan Jack, he will never let her go.
	But Duke Field is also a cold in both appearance and heart, and he also loves someone in a silent way. He only shows his feeling in front of the woman he loved, and the friends of him. He even doesn’t know how to say sweet words, but someone still loves him.
Chapter 231 Humble to the Dust
	Someone refers to Wendy.
	"Well." Jamie Moore answers casually. She is pondering when the waiter will offer them the dishes they ordered just now.
	The attitude of Jamie Moore is not very good, but Joey Lan doesn’t have any dissatisfaction toward her. After all, she is the girlfriend of the man that her best friend loves. If Jamie Moore has a good attitude towards her, it's really a ghost.
	"Can I share a table with you? We can recall our past now.” Joey Lan says as she reminds of something. Then she turns around to pull Duke Field’s arm, “Duke Field, what do you think of this?"
	Duke Field smiles at Joey Lan sweetly, “As long as you loves, it’s OK.”
	As long as you loves, it’s OK
	What an indulgent and loving sentence? But Wendy feels pain in her heart.
	"Wendy, would you mind it?" Joey Lan blinks her eyes, and then she asks Wendy deliberately.
	"Of course not." Wendy smiles lightly, and then she looks at Jamie Moore. Jamie Moore suddenly knows the meaning of Wendy, thus she stands up to give seat to Duke Field and Joey Lan.
	Although Jamie Moore doesn’t know the reason, she still stands by Wendy's side. Now she is here, no one could bully Wendy.
	Joey Lan sits down with Duke Field. She is very happy, and she stays close with Duke Field. Everyone could know they are lovers.
	Seeing that Wendy wears an indifferent expression on her face, Joey Lan wants to annoy Wendy, thus she mentions the time in high school. Although most of words are related to the beginning of Duke Field and her, Wendy still listens to it carefully.
	Maybe she will be sad, but it's the chance for Wendy to know the unknown side of Duke Field.
	Love will make somebody humble to the dust, but some people still love it.
	"I forgot to take an umbrella when it rains suddenly. The school was far away from home. I never expected Duke Field, who was rated as one of the campus beau by girls, would come to send me home. At that time, I was really surprised. That rainy day was the first date when we met each other. Later, we met occasionally in the school. Now I know that the previous encounters are deliberately made by Duke Field." Joey Lan smiles, with her eyes full of sweet.
	Duke Field holds Joey Lan in his arms, and then he frowns. It’s not right. It’s not on a rainy day that they met each other for the first time. The reason he remembered her was for that thing, and then he sent her to home on that rainy day.
	He looks at Joey Lan who is smiling, and then he returns to normal. Maybe it’s because the encounter on that day is in line with the beautiful expectations of girls, and the first meeting of them is not good, so Joey Lan would regard that rainy day as their first meeting.
	Jamie Moore looks at Joey Lan with doubts. It’s seems that their first meeting is very beautiful. So Duke Field must love Joey Lan very much, is she right?
	What’s the matter? Will Wendy end her enrequited love toward Duke Field now?
	Wendy doesn’t wear any expression on her face. Hearing the word of Joey Lan, she remembers the first meeting between Duke Field and her.
	That was not a good start, but she fell in love with Duke Field since then.
	But Duke Field doesn’t remember all of this.
	When the waiter puts the food on the table, Joey Lan doesn’t move her chopsticks. Instead, she asks Duke Field to take the dish for her.
	Duke Field just smiles at her, and then he begins to take the dish for her.
	Jamie Moore blinks her eyes. Seeing the action between them, Jamie Moore thinks, “Maybe this is the so-called playing coquettish. If she plays coquettish, Duke Field will do everything for her.”
	Dame! Is coquetry really so useful? How can’t she know this?
	She keeps it in her mind. She is ready to practice this on Dan William. After all, this works on Duke Field. So it will also work on Dan William, is she right?
	Jamie Moore takes dishes for Wendy as she thinks, and then she eats happily.
	Wendy and she eat freely, and they don’t have any worries about eating. They will not pretend to be a gorgeous lady in front of other people. They will do everything by their wills.
	Compared with them, Joey Lan is much more elegant. If the food is too hot, she will ask Duke Field to blow for her. If the food is too cold, she is not willing to eat food. If she eats fish, the fish can’ have stab. If she eats meat, the meat can’t have bone.
	Duke Field listens to all of her words. He will carefully pick out the bones in the fish and then put them into the bowl in front of Joey Lan.
	Wendy looks at them quietly, and then she sniffs. She feels the food in her mouth is very bitter. She knows that she should not see them, but she couldn't help but to looks at Duke Field.
	"It's too hot, and I don’t want to eat this." Joey Lan presses her lips. Seeing that Wendy is not in a good mood, she raises her eyebrows proudly. If Duke Field is not here, she will laugh loudly.
	Duke Field blows the meat for her. Then when the meat is cold, he puts the meat in her bowl, “It’s not hot now.”
	Jamie Moore shivers. What’s going on? She comes here to have lunch. She doesn’t want to vomit. Is there a need to be so pretentious?
	She will not eat the food if it is hot. Joey Lan, how fragile are you?
	Jamie Moore has an intuition. The sixth intuition of a woman told her that Joey Lan is showing off to Wendy. And Duke Field is the biggest capital for her to show off.
	"I want you to feed me." Joey Lan smiles sweetly. She looks at Duke Field with ambiguity, and then she requires with a smile.
	Duke Field shakes his head, and then he picks the meat in front of bowl, and hands it to Joey Lan’s mouth.
	Splat!
	The breaking sound of the glass stops the action of Duke Field. He and Joey Lan all look at the direction of the sound.
	"Excuse me, Miss, are you OK?" The waiter comes to Wendy and then asks.
	Wendy shakes her head. She is not in a good mood, and she says, “I’m fine.”
	The waiter sweeps away the debris on the ground with the cleaning tools. He carefully checks the ground to make sure there is no debris, so as not to hurt the feet of guest.
	"I'll go to the bathroom. You can eat first." Wendy's clothes are wet. She stands up, and smiles apologetically at them, and then she walks to the bathroom.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and she looks at the back of Wendy worriedly. Anyone will be sad when they see the man she loves show his love toward other woman.
	What’s more, Wendy has loved Duke Field for such a long time.
	Wendy walks to the bathroom, and stands in front of the washstand. She opens the tap and lets the water flowing. She holds a handful of water, and then washes her face with the water in her hand.
	The cold water stains falls down from her face. She looks at the girl who is a little embarrassed in the mirror. Her eyes are red, and the tip of her nose is red. She looks pitiful as if she has cried just now.
	Should she give up?
	Duke Field owns his own love now. He loves Joey Lan. So the love from her is nothing. He will never know that she loves him.
	That's it, Wendy. Give up Duke Field. And wish him happiness.
Chapter 232 It’s Just a Joke
	Just take everything as your dream. It’s just a vain dream. There is nothing to care about.
	She raises her head, and she tries all her effort to hide the tears in her eyes. She doesn’t want to look so embarrassed. Even if she is embarrassed, she doesn’t want to be seen by others .
	"What’s the matter? Have you been hurt by the sweet love between Duke and me?” A sweet voice suddenly resounds behind her. Wendy looks up and she sees the proud face of Joey Lan through the water stains that covers her eyes.
	Joey Lan holds her hands around her arm, and then she walks toward Wendy slowly. She raises her chin proudly, and her heels collide with the ground with a crisp sound.
	Wendy’s eyes become cold. Then she withdraws several papers from beside. She wipes the water stains on her face, and then she turns around to look at her, “What are you saying?”
	Joey Lan covers her face, and then she smiles, “Wendy, I know you love Duke Field. But I never expect that he would love me. So I am sorry.”
	Although she apologizes like this, she doesn’t say it sincerely. Instead, she is showing off to Wendy - She gets the love from Duke Field.
	Wendy’s face turns pale, and the smile on the corner of her face is a little bitter.
	She is also a person, and she also has flesh and blood. Even though she is an outgoing girl, she also feels sad when someone touches the scar in the bottom of her heart.
	However, she will never let her love be trampled by Joey Lan.
	There is only one person who can do this to her.
	"Never mind. I wish you two have a happy life. It's better that you two will never apart.” Wendy presses her lips, and she wears a smile on her face. It seems that she doesn’t feel pain for the words of Joey Lan.
	Joey Lan is very sweet, and the dress she wears is also sweet and brisk. When she talks, people may feel that she is coquettish, weak and willful. But this kind of girl is very popular among the men.
	The truth is that you should know how to pretend to be a lovely girl.
	"Well, come and break up with Duke Field. And then you should give him to me.” Wendy rolls her eyes. Joey Lan is sure that Wendy will say words like - “No, I don't like him anymore" or "Your happiness is my happiness".
	Hahaha.
	She is Wendy, and how could she say this?
	Since Duke Field has fallen in love with Joey Lan, it’s not a pity if she gives up. She also has her own pride. Duke Field and Joey Lan could hurt her, but her dignity can’t be trampled by others!
	Joey Lan’s face become stiffened. She is surprised that Wendy doesn’t say the words according to her imgination.
	She doesn’t know how to answer when she hears the words of Wendy. She can’t let Duke Field go.
	It’s not easy for her to fall in love with Duke Field. She even cheats him and everyone. Now it’s impossible for her to let Duke Field go.
	“Haha, it’s just a joke...”
	"I know." Wendy shrugs her shoulder, and then she walks out indifferently.
	Joey Lan turns around to look at the back of Wendy. And her eyes are full of jealousy, and she even wants to kill Wendy with her eyes.
	Why? She uses all her strength to get Duke Field. How could Wendy abandon Duke Field in such an easy way?
	Who is she?
	When Wendy returns back to the table, Jamie Moore is almost full. Duke Field, who is very cold, sits opposite her, which directly affects the eating mood of Jamie Moore, thus she doesn’t eat too much.
	When Jamie Moore plays with Dan William and Bruce Hill in the childhood, she never stays close to Duke Field. Although she is not afraid of him, she doesn’t like to play with a gloomy child. He keeps cold all the time, as if someone owes him millions of dollars, which make people dislike him.
	Wendy is such a fool. And she loves such a cold man.
	It's very strange. Why does Wendy love Duke Field?
	Wendy sits down without looking at Duke Field, and then she begins to eat.
	After a while, Joey Lan comes over. she covers her stomach with a very uncomfortable expression. Before she walks to them, her whole body falls to the ground.
	"Oh, my God, what’s the matter?" Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely. Duke Field walks to Joey Lan and then holds her in his arms with a worried expression. It seems that he is really worried about Joey Lan.
	But why does Joey Lan fall down suddenly?
	Wendy looks at all of this coldly. Duke Field holds Joey Lan in his arms and then walks out of the restaurant quickly. Joey Lan casts a look of victory to Wendy from the arm of Duke Field.
	It's so naive.
	"Understand? She is a strong performer. She gives us a good performance for free." Wendy stabs at the ribs in the bowl as if the ribs are Joey Lan and Duke Field. She stabs it for several times.
	She doesn’t understand this. Duke Field is such a cold man. How could he like the pretentious woman - Joey Lan?
	She is not willing to it.
	"What are you going to do, Wendy?" As soon as Duke Field and Joey Lan leaves, Jamie Moore has a good appetite suddenly. She presses her lips and then she eats happily.
	"What else can I do? Do you think I'm the kind of villain who will involve in others’ relationship? Give me some time."
	Give her some time, and then she will forget Duke Field.
	Although the process is painful, it is better than doing nothing and waiting for them to hurt her.
	Joey Lan can stimulate her just because she loves Duke Field.
	Jamie Moore looks at Wendy, and then she rubs her own hair, and she continues to eat food.
	At this time, the mobile phone rings. It’s a call from the special assistant of the ward of Ryan Jack.
	"Well. What's up? What? Does he wake up? I'll go now!" Jamie Moore is so excited when she hears the news. She stops eating. Then she stands up and walks out immediately, “Wendy, you can eat slowly here. Ryan Jack wakes up. I'll go to see him first."
	"OK, you go first.” Wendy is a little helplessness. Originally, she wants to hang out with Jamie Moore. But now, the news comes suddenly, and then she leaves. It was too disappointing.
	However, there are reasons for this. After all, Ryan Jack saves her life, so she will care about him, and she also feels guilty for this.
	In those days, Jamie Moore just stays in the hospital with Ryan Jack, but his condition has not improved. Jamie Moore and Ian Moore can only visit him at the time specified by the hospital.
	Generally, Only Jamie Moore enters the ICU. And Ian Moore usually comes after school.
	Ryan Jack has wake up, but he is still weak. Jamie Moore feels guilty for this.
	When it’s time for visit, Jamie Moore sees the man who lies on the bed with a sour nose. "Are you OK?"
	In order not to let Jamie Moore worry him, Ryan Jack presses his lips slightly. "I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me."
	Joe Mo wants to get angry, she chuckles after seeing him, saying, "You almost lose your life for this. Are you still OK?"
	Ryan Jack bursts into tears unconsciously before Ryan Jack says something, “Ryan, thank you. If you don’t save my life, maybe I have died now.”
Chapter 233 They Are All Liars
	Ryan Jack wants to wipe tears for her, and he says in a funny way, "What did you say?"
	Seeing Ryan Jack in such a way, Jamie Moore suddenly reminds the normal Ryan Jack. Then she says seriously, “Thank you.”
	"Oh, does the sun rise from the West today?" He stares at Jamie Moore with a funny face.
	The guilty in Jamie Moore’s heart suddenly disappears. She looks at the funny expression of Ryan Jack and then she says, “You're a scum. The sun rises from the ground!"
	"Jamie, you don't need to feel sorry for me. This is what I want to do and no one can stop me."
	Jamie Moore frowns when she hears this. She looks at Ryan Jack with doubts.
	He uses all his strength to save her. Is this because he loves her?
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is at a loss, Ryan Jack knows that she doesn’t like him at all.
	"What are you thinking? We're friends. I'll do it if someone else suffers such accident!" He says in a relax way.
	The injury is so serious, and the truth can’t be hid by several words. He doesn't regret what he did for her at all.
	"Miss Moore, the visiting time is up." The porter knocks on the door and says outside.
	Jamie Moore looks at porter outside the door, and then she smiles at Ryan Jack, “Time is up. I will go first now, and I will come to see you tomorrow.
	"OK! Then I'll wait for you to come to see me tomorrow." Ryan Jack looks at the leaving back of Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore receives the call from Secretary Sam after leaving the hospital.
	"Secretary Sam? What’s the matter?"
	The steady voice of Secretary Sam comes from the phone, "You can pick up the chairman's plane at ten o’clock in the morning, and the chairman would be happy for this."
	Hearing the words of Secretary Sam, Jamie Moore is very happy, and then she says, “Thank you, Secretary Sam!”
	Jamie Moore takes a taxi to the airport after hanging up. But there is a traffic jam, thus it’s almost 10:05 when Jamie Moore arrives.
	When she runs to the door of the airport, Dan William has left.
	What? It's only five minutes. Dan William leaves so fast!
	Jamie Moore murmurs. She is angry.
	The familiar footsteps are getting closer, "Miss Moore."
	Hearing the voice, Jamie Moore is very excited. Sure enough, Dan William is always such a low-key people.
	"Derek William, you are here. Where is Dan William?" Jamie Moore grabs Derek William excitedly. She looks behind him from time to time, but she could not see the figure she wants to see.
	Seeing Jamie Moore pulls him, Derek William coughs awkwardly. Then he stays away from Jamie Moore naturally. He takes a few steps back. "Miss Moore, you are too late. Our young master has left."
	Jamie Moore lowers her head after hearing the words. She is a little sad now.
	Why can't I come here five minutes earlier? I miss him because I'm five minutes late.
	But then she suddenly reminds of something, and then she opens her eyes widely, “It’s not right. If your young master leaves, why are you still here?"
	They cheat me together. They are all liars!
	Jamie Moore stays close to Derek Jamie. She gnashes her teeth and says. "Tell me quickly where he is!"
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is very angry, and she seems to blow the anger to him, Derek William says immediately, "Young master is still here. Young master is in the black May Bach at the door."
	"You know what you are!" Jamie Moore decides not to settle accounts with him for the time being. It's more important to find Dan William!
	But when Jamie Moore walks out of the door, and she is ready to speed up after seeing the May Bach, the May Bach suddenly starts the engine!
	What! Is he teasing me! I don't believe I can't catch up with you today!
	She takes a taxi on the road, “Master, I'm in a hurry! Come on! Help me catch up with the car ahead!"
	Seeing Jamie Moore in such a hurry way, the driver says in a funny way, “Little girl, it's a luxury car in front of you. Do you love the man in the car?"
	"Eh, how could you talk like this? It's my husband. He leaves me behind after we have a quarrel!" Jamie Moore chokes and she even squeezes out a few tears at the right time.
	Hearing this, the driver thinks that your husband is not a good man. How could he leave his wife alone after quarreling, “Girl, don't worry, I will catch up with your husband today!"
	Then the driver speeds up immediately, and then the car runs quickly on the road.
	Jamie Moore pretends that she is very sad, and she pretends to wipe tears. But there is a sly smile on the corner of her mouth.
	The taxi follows May Bach all the way to the hotel. Jamie Moore follows Dan William quietly. It seems that his husband has done something wrong. Thus she comes to here to reveal the fact.
	Dan William and his client choose to meet in the restaurant on the eighth floor. But it seems that something has happened. Jamie Moore follows Dan William to the eighth floor, but she sees that Dan William changes his direction and goes to the third floor with his client.
	She remembers that Dan William told her that it’s bad to change the meeting place he had arranged with others. Otherwise, it will cause trouble to others. What is he doing now?
	After Dan William sits down with his client, Jamie Moore also chooses a position near them. She covers her face with the menu, and looks at them with a pair of sly eyes.
	This scene suddenly reminds her of the underground party meets each other in spy war movies. She suddenly feels that she is very cool!
	Bah, what are you thinking? You think too much now!
	The client in front of Dan William has just come from the United States. This time, he goes to the United States mainly for this cooperation case, so he comes here to meet him immediately after returning back to China.
	As they talk in a low voice, Jamie tries all her effort to hear the dialogue between them. In order not to be noticed, she pretends to be interested in the menu as she listens.
	"Mr. William is so young and promising, and you even have unique vision and insights. I believe we can cooperate happily." The client closes the contract with satisfaction and then shakes hands with Dan William.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he also shakes hand with his client. His black eyes are as bright as obsidian. Although he just gets off the plane, the noble temperament of the whole body can’t be covered; this makes people unable to move their eyes.
	The client - Edward glances at the direction of Jamie Moore for several times. Then he says after hesitating for a while, “Mr. William, do people in your country have the quirk of peeping at handsome men?"
	Dan William frowns, and then he looks at Edward with doubts.
	"The girl at the right table in front of us has been staring at us for a long time. I wonder that she admires you, am I right?"
	Dan William smiles quietly, and then he looks aside. He sees Jamie Moore who covers her face with the menu. Then he turns around and says, “I'm sorry, I've something to do now. If there's no problem, let's stop at here today."
Chapter 234 Be Afraid of Heights
	Edward stuns for a moment, and just wants to tell him that the contract hasn't been signed yet. But he sees that Dan William has stood up.
	On the other side, Jamie sees Dan found her and she doesn’t know what she thinks. She suddenly flinches. Before he finishes talking with the client, she hurries to leave.
	She just wants to escape away quietly. She creeps cautiously like a cat for a few steps, and she hits the cupboard which is full of wine with a snap. She is knocked to the ground by the reactive force.
	"Ah..." She supports her hands backwards and stabilizes her body. She accidentally places her palm in the place where there are glass fragments, and her calf is also hurt by the springing glass fragments.
	Ah! Is it inappropriate for her to go out today?
	"Lady, are you okay?" The waiter comes to her and asks.
	Jamie is about to shake her head and go away, but she finds a shadow covering her. Then she looks up and finds that it is Dan. She doesn’t know when he comes to her.
	She shrinks her neck, trying to shrink her head into her clothes so that he cannot recognize her.
	In fact, Dan discovers her as soon as she walks into the hotel. This is the reason why he doesn't go to the eighth floor but changes to the third floor.
	He remembers that she is afraid of heights.
	His deep eyes stay on her bleeding hand and he frowns. The atmosphere around him suddenly becomes horrible.
	Oh my god. He's angry. Will he rape her before killing her and then throw her dead body into the remote mountains just because she follows him secretly?
	But Jamie finds sadly that Dan suddenly squats down, which stops her only survival way!
	She is really over!
	Jamie grimaces, thinking about whether to say hello or something. However, she doesn’t expect that Dan even hugs her and strides toward the elevator.
	Jamie is a little bit surprised; she thinks she will be scolded by him seriously. After all, she just makes trouble again.
	But she feels so good when nestling in his arms. She really wishes to let time stay at this moment forever.
	Dan does not leave with Jamie, but he comes to the lounge on the first floor of the hotel. He puts Jamie on the sofa and borrows the medicine box from the waiter to apply medicine to her.
	"Save your force. Ah, help me. It really hurts!" As soon as the disinfectant touches the wound, Jamie cries out in pain.
	"Who let you come here?" Dan asks casually and reduces the force of his action.
	Jamie purses her mouth and thinks that she just follows him. But she answers, "I haven't eaten the dishes in here for a long time. So I come here to enjoy it."
	"Well." Dan looks calm, as if he doesn’t doubt it.
	Jamie breathes a sigh of relief, thinking secretly that she has solved it. But she hears a cold voice from there, "I just think that you follow me."
	Boom!
	After Jamie hears it, her face instantly flushes. Her eyes look to other place. She forgets the pain on the wound and defend for herself, "Who? Who follows you? Why are you so narcissistic? What’s the need to follow you?"
	Although she really follows him from the airport, if he knows it, then she really doesn’t have to face to meet him anymore. It’s ashamed!
	Dan doesn't answer her anymore and he still keeps wears a calm and casual expression. He takes out an ointment and squeezes some of it out on his fingertips. Then he applies it evenly on her wounds and finally covers the wound with a bandage.
	"Okay, it's all right."
	Jamie just regains her mind, scratching her head and being a little shy.
	"Don't let the wound touch the water as possible as you can, so as to avoid infection during this time." His voice is as low as before, which makes the listener unconsciously addicted to it.
	After a pause, he looks away from Jamie's furry head to other places. "I'm leaving because I have something else to solve. Can you go back by yourself?"
	Yes?
	When Jamie hears it, she thinks that this is unbelievable. She looks up at him in surprise. Come on. She is already hurt. Does he actually feel relieved to let her go back alone?
	Why is it different from the plot in the TV series?
	Jamie blinks and knows that he wants to leave.
	What should she do? What should she do?
	Jamie's brain works quickly. She comes here with the determination to pester him. Therefore, she is not willing to he let him go so easily.
	No way! It seems that she has to use his trump card!
	Now that Jamie can't control the situation, she runs up in few steps in disregard of the wound on her leg. And then her whole person jumps onto Dan's back and she is holding his neck tightly without letting it go.
	Dan is also frightened, feeling the person on his body and subconsciously putting his hand to the back to firmly support Jamie.
	"What are you doing?" Dan can’t help laughing and his voice is still as dumb as usual. She hugs his neck tightly, and buries her small face in his neck. There is a faint smell of fragrance comes from her.
	Does she know what she is doing now?
	She may not know how distressed he is when he sees her hurt and how many times he refrains himself from holding her and comforting her?
	What she does now may ruin the efforts he did just now. He just tried so hard to calm down!
	"My leg is hurt and it's hard to take a taxi at this time. Can you take me back?" Jamie pouts while there’s a bit of grievance in her tone, and her hands around his neck tighten.
	She decides that she wants to hug his neck tightly, so that he won’t be able to leave her alone!
	It is hard to wait until he comes back after dealing with everything abroad. If she easily lets him go now, she will have no decent reason to haunt him.
	Jamie seldom acts coquettishly. Not to mention that she said to Dan last time that she is not the kind of people who will act coquettishly. Then she really obeys her rules.
	But now, what is she talking about? Is she acting coquettishly now?
	Dan is in a trance and his eyes flicks. He is sure that he has heard it correctly. Then he answers her and walks away by holding her on his back.
	Jamie receives a lot of envious sights along the way and she is really happy and delighted.
	She really wants to laugh. As expected, acting coquettishly really works on him. The boss really doesn't throw her out!
	Jamie sits obediently in the front passenger seat and looks at Dan’s profile which is reflected on the window. His eyebrows show his tiredness, but it does not harm his handsome appearance. His face has three-dimensional features. It seems that it is carved by master artists.
	Dan drives her to the gate of the hospital, but Jamie has no intention of getting out of the car.
	"Oh, my leg really hurts." She wrinkles her face and mutters.
	While talking, she glances at him from the corner of her eyes. She only wishes he can stay beside her.
	Dan frowns, leaning closer to her and glancing at her wound, his voice is nervous, "Where do you feel it hurt?"
	It really works!
	"The palm of my hand is painful." She spreads her palm. Because the bandage is not big enough, and only one sheet is attached on the wound, so half of the wound, which is bleeding blood streaks, remains uncovered.
Chapter 235 Jamie Is His Big Aim
	She just says that her leg hurts, and then she says her palm hurts in few seconds. Jamie, you really finish a bad work.
	Dan grabs her wrist without hesitation and places it in front of him, blowing gently. His voice is rarely gentle with endless love.
	Her palm is tickled by him, and Jamie only feels that the whole person is sensitive that she almost has nosebleeds.
	Her small face suddenly bursts into red one and she doesn’t dare to look at Dan. Her heart beats frantically. And an idea appears in her silly head.
	Dan ... Does he like her too?
	Jamie is somewhat frightened by her own thoughts. Her big, bright eyes blink for a few times. She watches Dan's eyes with some hopes.
	"Does it still hurt?" Dan glances at her. There is a subtle shock in his dark eye and then it is a meaningful sight.
	"No, it doesn't hurt anymore." Jamie sweetly shakes her head subconsciously. In fact, it doesn't hurt at all. But she seems a little happy to see him being nervous about her.
	Dan nods gently and lets go of her small hand. He holds a straight posture without speaking again.
	"I..." Jamie opens her mouth and unconsciously looks away. She keeps using her right hand to hold the fingers of her left hand. Even the atmosphere in the car is a little bit tense.
	She wants to tell him that she really likes him. But if she does it suddenly, will he feel it strange even though she comes here and is ready to accept the possibility of being rejected?
	"What?" Dan turns his head and looks at her patiently. His dark eyes glow with fine lights, which are so charming and demagogic, as if inadvertently she will be sucked into them.
	But his eyes always show incomprehensible emotions that Jamie doesn’t understand and it will make her unable to guess his inner thoughts.
	She just feels that Dan is a little strange today, but it's hard to say how strange he is.
	"I..." The next few words are very simple, but the words are hard to be said out even she is prepared.
	There is some embarrassment on her small face, and her eyes also aim at Dan. She hesitates; it seems that she is thinking about something.
	"Nothing! I got to go!" Jamie wants to ask what happens to her mouth. Why can’t she say such a few words? Then she closes the door of the car and runs away.
	Dan smirks with relief. His handsome appearance shows tenderness, which indicating that he is moved by Jamie.
	The phone beside the seat vibrates. He glances at it coldly and picks it up to answer.
	"Mr. William, is everything going well? The thing you orders has also started." Secretary Sam's voice comes from the phone.
	"Well, very well." Dan affirms his work and the raised the corner of his mouth, which reveals that he is in a good mood.
	"Then my bonus and the holiday at the end of the year ..." Secretary Sam asks a little hesitantly. Her work is not easy. She is apparently bought by Jamie to tell her the schedule of her boss. But in essence, she is still a spy of her boss, who assigns her to stay beside Jamie and to be ready to welcome Jamie, her boss’s big aim, at any time.
	Dan called Secretary Sam on the first night of his business trip and ordered her to do two things. The first thing is, if Jamie asks her when he will return to the country, she should report to him. Moreover, Derek's appearance in the airport was not an accident when today Jamie came to the airport to find him. And the thing that he didn’t go home but went to Star to meet the customer was deliberately designed too.
	If Jamie doesn’t ask Secretary Sam about his schedule at the beginning, he will start another plan for his silly aim. But surprisingly, Jamie cares about his schedule.
	This shows that she doesn’t hate him completely in her heart.
	Because the taxi that Jamie took to catch up with him, was specially arranged by him. The driver is also his man. So what she said on the car has been reported by the driver to him.
	Then things progressed as Dan William’s expectations, except for Jamie accidentally hit the glass and fell on it. Everything just happened as expected.
	All of these begin because of a person.
	That is Wendy.
	If it isn’t for her to call suddenly, telling him all the things and tell him that Jamie has fallen in love with him, he might still be in the dark.
	In his life, except Jamie, he wants no one.
	Wendy also told him that Jamie evades him because of the thing happened five years ago. But as for what happened five years ago, Wendy didn’t say anything.
	It isn't until Jamie got off the car just now that Dan finally realizes that things happened five years ago might not be so simple.
	Jamie left before the day of their engagement ceremony. Only a few people know about this matter. According to Jamie’s character, it is impossible for her to embarrass him and leave him alone to deal with the mess.
	He always thinks that Jamie left him because she doesn’t love him. It turns out that this idea is not true.
	What happened five years ago? It made her leave without hesitation.
	Secretary Sam feels that it is really getting harder and harder to work now. Not only does she have to deal with things in the company, but now she has to worry about other things. But for the bonus and the holidays, she will work hard!
	"Approve." Dan finishes speaking and cuts the phone.
	His gaze lingers on the screen for a while. Then he dials a call.
	_
	Jamie returns to the manor after leaving the hospital, thinking that Dan should be here at this time, so her whole person is extremely excited.
	Although she can’t say it out, Dan is such a smart person that he will understand it if she suggests him for several times.
	Thinking of it, she paces move quickly.
	Ian races on the lawn with a ball-shaped chubby dog. Although it seems that the two short legs of Ian cannot win the four legs of the dog, he is trained by Night.1 and he runs very fast. His speed is extremely high. What’s more, he deliberately slows down his paces to wait for the dog.
	The dog is a Pyrenean mountain dog, which is also called Big White Bear. His white hair is neatly and cleanly combed. It’s a gift from Dan.
	Ian names it "Kiki".
	Kiki is quite fat, and its meat is full of soft flesh. As long as it curls up, it looks likes a white ball. One can hardly see what it is if he doesn’t look at it carefully.
	Don't be cheated by its innocent appearance. It’s a gift from Dan William, so don’t simply take it as a pet.
	Ian also knows that Kiki is not a normal puppy. It is very smart and only listens to his words. In addition, it is sent by Dan, so it is especially cherished and liked.
	"Why does mom come back?" Ian sees Jamie walking on the tree-lined path. Then his eyes light up and then he runs over with his short legs.
	Kiki also uses his legs and runs with Ian, following behind Ian with his tail waggling.
	"Bunny, come and give mommy a sweet kiss." Jamie kisses on his soft little face.
Chapter 236 The dog Is Coaxed by Me.
	"Mommy, your saliva." Ian frowns, looking at Jamie mournfully.
	"Bad boy, do you still care about this in this age?" Jamie pats helplessly on his forehead, and then she feels something brushing across her leg.
	What the hell?
	She immediately looks down and sees a cute dog.
	"This is ... Big White Bear?" Jamie's eyes suddenly lighten.
	She immediately puts Ian down. Then she hugs Kiki with surprise.
	Ian does not have any dissatisfaction when seeing Jamie holding Kiki with a happy face. He smiles with beaming eyes. He knows that mummy will like it. From the past mummy has said that she must own a cute dog. But she has no chance and no time. Now it seems that her dream is finally achieved.
	Will Daddy be intentional? Ian looks at Kiki and thinks by himself.
	"Bunny, where do you get the dog? It looks so cute." Jamie holds Kiki which is still a bit heavy. She uses a hand to smooth its dog hair and asks.
	Ian is speechless, "Mommy, who tell you that the dog is coaxed by me? This is a gift from Daddy to Bunny. It's very smart. It will do whatever I order."
	"Really?" Jamie raises her eyebrows. Why does Dan give Ian such a dog? She then says, "Mommy is exhausted when I have to raise you. Now I have to take care of a dog?"
	Exhausted? Ian's mouth twitches. Mommy, what the hell are you exhausted?
	"Bunny will take care of Kiki by myself. In the future, Kiki will follow Bunny. Kiki eats whatever Bunny eats." Ian raises his round chin and takes Kiki out of Jamie's arms.
	Kiki seems to understand Ian's words, sticking his tongue out and licking it on his small handsome face.
	A surprise shows in Jamie's clear eyes. Then she chuckles, "Bad boy." Then she walks to the villa with Ian.
	Ian's sentence reminds her of a joke. It is saying that for a dog owner, his dog will eats what he eats at the beginning of the month. While he will eats whatever the dog eats at the end of the month.
	But Dan is so rich that he can even afford the expenses of raising a lot of dogs. So she doesn’t worry about it at all.
	And it looks like that Kiki is not a normal dog. Dan must have his own intentions by sending Kiki to Ian.
	"Miss Moore, Ian, you are back." As soon as they walk into the courtyard of the villa, they see Jozo sitting under the flower stand. She is holding the scissors in one hand and a pink rose in the other hand and is looking at the bifurcated branches. Seeing Jamie and Ian come in, she smiles slightly.
	Although she is sitting in a wheelchair, her beautiful face will be noticed by others at the first sight.
	Jozo's eyes stay on Jamie for a while and fall on Ian. Her eyes express a bad intention.
	This boy is the key to everything.
	"Yes." Jamie nods slightly, secretly thinking that Jozo really doesn't treat herself as a guest. She really intends to live here and never leaves.
	Thinking of it, she looks around and she is a little lost without seeing the figure.
	"Dan hasn't returned yet. Are you looking for him?" Jozo asks as she puts the well-cut flowers into the vase.
	"Doesn't he come back?" Jamie frowns and looks at Ian.
	Ian shakes his head to express that he has been playing with Kiki before. So he doesn’t know.
	"That's okay." Jamie is puzzled. Dan doesn't return after he sends her to the hospital?
	"Mommy, I'll take Kiki to eat first. Kiki seems to be hungry." Ian points to Kiki, who is rubbing his short legs coquettishly, and then shows a big smile.
	It looks very peaceful now. In fact, the undercurrent is working. In addition, Mia, who kidnapped Jamie before, has not been found. The man sent by Night.1 hasn’t found her yet, but Ian doesn’t do anything.
	Night.7 tells him that it is a mysterious group that takes Mia away. As for who they are, it is strange that those people seem to know them very well. Every time when they just find some clues, those people will quickly evacuate. Over time, Ian chooses to wait and see how things will progress.
	"Okay. Go ahead." Jamie squeezes his small face. Then she steps on the spiral staircase and walks upstairs to the second floor.
	She is going to prepare something and then visit Ryan in the hospital.
	Ryan's physical condition is almost stable but it still needs to be observed. He will be transferred to the general ward after a while.
	Before he recovers, Jamie should take good care of him.
	She sighs and goes into the bedroom to take some clothes. When she is about to leave, she hears the sound of water coming from the bathroom.
	Is he Dan?
	During her hesitation, the sound of water in the bathroom gradually disappears. Is he coming out?
	Just as she is considering what she can say after he comes out, a light scent of mint suddenly penetrates into her nose. She can only feel this light smell, as if she is surrounded by it and she can't escape.
	Jamie raises her head violently and she almost squirts out bloods.
	Dan holds a white and dry towel in one hand and wipes his black hair, which is as black as an ink. And the hair is still dripping with water, which is sliding down his neck and flowing into the dark blue bathrobe on his body...
	Feeling that her nose is warm, Jamie covers her small nose reflexively and her cheeks turn red. She stares at Dan's wheat-colored chest.
	"What are you doing with your nose covered?" Dan's eyebrows frown. His action that wipes his hair continues. He feels it strange to see Jamie suddenly covers her nose.
	Jamie’s consciousness is recovered a little by this sentence and then her lips are pursed. Her eyes turn around and she say, "There is a strange smell in the room ..."
	Smell? Dan smells but apart from the scent of his body and fragrance on Jamie's body, there is no strange smell.
	He thinks and stares at the beautiful face that is covered under Jamie's hands for a while. With a light simile on his lips, he walks to the sofa in front of the LCD TV and sits down, "Come over."
	Jamie walks towards him without hesitation, looking at the back of his head and asking, "What's the matter?"
	"Help me wipe my hair." Dan hands the towel back to her. Jamie immediately releases her hand covering her nose and takes the towel.
	There is a little excitement in her heart. She has wanted to rub Dan’s hair for a long time. His hair quality is very good, and it really matches with her thoughts. It is black and soft. She once touched it before when he was sleeping. The silky smooth touch makes her miss it for a long time.
	Now she can act wildly on his head. Can she not be excited?
Chapter 237 The kiss is really...
	Jamie touches the bottom of her nose to make sure that there is no blood flowing down, so that she can comfortably wipe his hair.
	Dan's eyes close slightly and he is motionless. Seeming to sleep with his eyes closed, he is enjoying this rarely quiet time.
	Wow, it feels so good ... Jamie sighs while wiping, and can’t help squinting. If she isn’t afraid that her behavior is too strange, Jamie wants to sigh.
	When she is wiping, the towel in her hand falls on the sofa, and Jamie doesn't find anything wrong.
	Dan's closed eyes open, and he feels something is wrong with his head. Looking at the reflection on the TV screen, Jamie is actually rubbing his hair with her hand, with a small intoxicating expression, which makes people can’t help laughing.
	"What are you doing?" He asks indifferently.
	What?
	Jamie instantly regains her consciousness. Her eyes blink a few times, and then she replies, "Wipe your hair."
	Dan's mouth twitches, "What do you use to wipe?"
	"Of course it is a towel." Jamie sneers in disgust. What stupid question is he asking?
	But when Jamie sees the towel that falls on the sofa, she is froze. What ...
	What the hell is going on?
	When does the towel fall on the sofa?
	Jamie purses her lower lip angrily and then she moves away her hand.
	She thinks that Dan will say something or do something. Who knows he just picks up the towel that is dropped on the side lightly and wipes his hair a few times casually. Then he stands up and throws the towel into the dirty clothes basket.
	Jamie sighs slightly and looks at her hands with some water stains on it. She puts her hands in front of her nose and sniffs gently. The smell is the kind of shampoo which brand is used by Dan.
	After a while, Dan walks out, and it is almost 1p.m. now.
	Jamie stops for a moment, seeing him walking while he is buttoning his cufflink. She asks suspiciously, "Are you going to the company?"
	Dan glances at her lightly with smile intentions in his black eyes. He habitually manages the crease of the cufflink, "Not me. It’s we."
	"What?" Jamie doesn't figure out what he means and she looks at him confusingly.
	"Don’t you be enough to be absent from work?" Dan squints at her and sees the two bags on the bed behind her. He steps over and picks it up to look, "What is this?"
	"The clothes for changing." Jamie is still thinking about his question just now.
	"What does it use for?" Dan worries in his heart. He has already understood it vaguely that it has something to do with Ryan.
	"Ryan is still in the observation period. I'm going to take care of him." Jamie answers almost subconsciously.
	Dan's face quickly becomes bad and the faint smile at the corner of his mouth fades away. He looks at her with a cold expression, "Do you take care of him? There are so many nurses in the hospital. Does he still need you to take care of him?"
	His tone isn’t very good and even a little cold. Jamie can’t help trembling, feeling the atmosphere is so terrible.
	"He is injured because of me so I take care of him for granted ..." Jamie looks directly at his eyes without scruple, but she notices a disappointment in his eyes...
	"What is his role in your heart?" Dan looks at her lukewarmly. There are indescribable emotions in his eyes. His voice is low and cold, which makes it like the kinds of corner edge that is impeccable.
	What kind of role he is?
	If she really likes him, what is Ryan’s role in her heart?
	Does she like and want both?
	Dan sneers at himself, and his eyes looks straight into her clear eyes.
	"Ryan is just my friend and you ..." Are the person I like.
	For the last few words, Jamie still can’t say it. There is a little shame on her small face while she is biting her lower lip and feeling nervous.
	"And am I just your boss?" Dan knows what she wants to say later. So he asks this deliberately, trying to force her to say that.
	"No..."
	"What is that?"
	Dan is approaching, holding her delicate chin and forcing her to look at him.
	He is forcing her.
	"It's nothing ..." Jamie bites her lower lip tightly, daring not to put her eyes on Dan. This is a performance of being in love.
	She hasn't prepared it yet, and she must tell him when she is ready!
	Dan watches her action of biting her lips tightly and his eyes dims slightly. He leans over slightly and his cold lips touch her warm pink lips. He kisses her lips tightly.
	Jamie doesn't expect him to kiss her suddenly at this time. Her heart rate is constantly increasing and her hand cannot help pulling his shirt. Suddenly she feels a pain in her lower lip.
	"Hmm ..." She frowns tightly and makes a noise. But Dan doesn't let her go and the force on her lips becomes bigger and bigger, which almost takes her breath away.
	She suffocates a little and thumps with her small hand, trying to struggle but it doesn't help.
	Just as Jamie is dizzy, she is pressed against the bed by Dan. Something is going to happen!
	Dan is about to continue the kiss, but he feels a pain in his lips. And when he opens his eyes slightly, he sees Jamie seemingly wish to bite him. Her appearance really makes him feel touched.
	"Are you a dog?" Jamie glares at him when she covers her small lips that are bitten twice. She licks with her tongue and feels it is bloody. Oh my god. He actually bites it into bleeding.
	Noticing her small movements, Dan's eyes are a little dim and hot. But his look is still the same and he shows a sexy and fascinating smile. "I think you just enjoyed it just now."
	Jamie's small face is ashamed and red like a ripe cherry that seems to be very fresh. Her eyes roll round and round and he doesn’t know what excuses she is thinking.
	"Who? Who are you mentioned? I'm almost going to be killed by you. How can I enjoy it?" She says with a decided heart.
	Although she says like this, Jamie actually sighs in her heart and feels that the taste of that kiss is really good ...
	Dan raises his eyebrows, apparently unbelieving, "Oh? You can't even breathe when you kiss. Will you game over after then?"
	"Game over? Why will I game over? Do you still want to do this with me every day?" Jamie squints at him with some alertness. If he really does it once a day, she will go to die right away, then she doesn’t need to worry about she will accidentally die because she can’t breathe when she kisses.
	"Well, I think it’s you who want to do this with me." Dan says with his slender fingers touching her lips and rubbing it gently with his fingertips. He smiles with evil charms. Can you still regard him as the man who has cold and noble appearance?
	"Who tell you I want to do this with you?" Jamie quickly denies, turning her face aside. There is such a bad feeling that she will be caught in his hand and cannot escape.
Chapter 238 You’ve got everything you want on me.
	Dan's face turns bad and he uses his fingers to move her face, "Tell me. Who do you want to do this with?"
	Jamie is frightened by his sudden change. Before she can react, she reflexively says, "You!"
	What? What is her mouth doing...?
	Dan's face eases quickly again. He just intends to tease her and happiness is exposed in his eyes. Unexpectedly, the girl will be so cute when she is so anxious. And she is stupid but cute.
	"Well, I know. Come with me." Although there is some excitement in his heart, Dan's face has still an evil smile. He pinches a few times on Jamie's smooth and delicate small face.
	"You ..." Jamie is dumbfounded. What the hell is her mouth doing? Can it wait for her to react before speaking?
	She is really stupid!
	"You can tell me directly if you want. I will satisfy you." He throws a sly sight at her. Somehow, Jamie suddenly reminds of the scene when they sleep together that night...
	With a loud boom in her mind, Jamie's cheeks flushes quickly. She lifts her hand and pats on Dan's chest. "You’re shameless! Do you want to abandon me when you’ve got everything you want on me?"
	Does he regard her as the same as those easy woman? Can she be discarded after she is used?
	Dan feels distressed, grabbing her little hand. His serious black eyes look into her eyes.
	"In your heart, am I that kind of person?"
	When does he want to abandon her? Her blame is too serious and Dan can’t let himself ignore it. If he doesn't make it clear, it might get some misunderstandings.
	There have been too many misunderstandings between them, and he can no longer allow any misunderstanding between them.
	The top priority now is to make this stupid girl realize it.
	Jamie is dumbfounded for a moment, and then she subconsciously shakes her head like a rattle. "No, no."
	Dan is not that kind of person. She knows exactly what kind of person he is. She just has no confidence in herself. What if he really dislikes her?
	"You, don't you think I'm too active so you don't like me?" She blinks her eyes, which makes she look extra pitiful and makes others unable to move their eyes.
	Dan is shocked. He doesn't expect Jamie to think so.
	She says that he is indifferent to her. But it is better to say that she is afraid of what she will do, so she’s deliberately estranged herself from him.
	Why will she think so with her stupid brain?
	He is angry again but wants to laugh. He stretches out his fingers to bounce on her forehead. "Have your IQ been eaten by pigs?"
	Jamie covers her forehead with a whimper and looks at him sadly, "It’s your IQ that is eaten by pigs ..."
	Are her thoughts wrong?
	Isn’t Dan estranged himself from her in those days? She seems not to understand him more and more. Or she never understands him.
	But these cannot be reasons for her to stop her love to him.
	She just likes him and always likes him. She won't change because of anything and anybody. It's just because things of five years ago makes her more timid and is afraid to take that step.
	"Jamie, do you fall in love me?" Dan controls the emotions in his heart and seemingly smiles. The sunlight falls on his perfect side face and she can’t tell any mood from his black eyes.
	The reason why he pretends to be so careless is that he is betting whether Jamie will take the initiative to speak.
	Dan is waiting for her to speak but until the end, it is Jamie's silence.
	Is she so unconfident in herself?
	He smiles sarcastically and puts his hands in his pockets. He is ready to leave first.
	It seems that the second plan must be adopted.
	His mood is ups and downs, and he can’t hear the words he wants to hear. That shouldn’t blame Jamie. It’s because he doesn’t give her enough confidence.
	"I just fall in love with you!"
	A clear and sweet voice comes from behind, which beats Dan's heart.
	Dan is astonished, as if he has been frozen in place. He still hears that the pleasant voice of the girl behind him continues.
	"Dan, I just like you. I like you very much! If you want to laugh at me, then you can go on. I can't manage to hide my feelings and keep it silent!"
	It must be ridiculous if she likes him, right?
	She can already imagine that she is now in a state of embarrassment and fragility. It can’t be more appropriate to describe her.
	Dan turns his back to Jamie and his mouth raises, which gives a very warm feeling.
	"Regardless of other women who like me, I can guarantee that you are my only love!" His voice is low as if it’s playing piano music.
	He turns around, holds Jamie's face in his hands and gently kisses her forehead.
	What does he say just now?
	Is she the only one in his heart forever?
	Does he mean?
	"In my life, I wish to hold your hand and grow old with you. Except for this wish, I want nothing else."
	His tone is low and his words are clear. Every word drops into Jamie's original turbulent heart like a small stone and her heart beats faster.
	Jamie's pink lips purses slightly, and then she rushes into his arms. His arms are warm and filled with a fragrance, which surrounds her tightly and warm the bottom of her heart.
	Dan's lips raise and his big hand strokes her hair while he is smiling slightly.
	"Then why don't you tell me you like me?" Suddenly thinking of something, Jamie looks up from his arms and mutters.
	Dan looks at her grieved appearance and only scrapes her nose with indulgence, "Little girl, do you with to get paid back without paying?"
Chapter 239 Thing of five years ago
	It seems reasonable.
	Jamie's pretty face is red. She is always stubborn but because of Dan's words at this moment, her small face turns red and she is very cute.
	"But you said clearly that I am no different from other women! It is because of this that I have been angry with you for a long time!" This is what she has always cared about, and there are a lot of distresses in her heart.
	That is the worst words that Dan says to her.
	Dan supports his forehead a little worryingly. He just says that when he is angry. Who knows this little idiot really takes it seriously?
	"Don't you say at the time, I really think highly of myself? So, let’s call it even." He raises his eyebrows and smiles. He reaches out to rub her hair.
	Well ...She seems to have said that. Okay, it’s her fault.
	Just then, the door is suddenly opened.
	They two turn around and see Jozo standing outside. A panic shows on her gentle face. When she sees Jamie and Dan leaning together, her eyes expose some anger.
	She calms down and looks at them with a look of surprise. "Dan, when do you come back? I don't know you are here too. I just want to ask Miss Moore about something...
	Jamie doesn't miss her flicking panic, and immediately she feels a little puzzled. Will Jozo hear the conversation between them outside the door?
	Why is she so panic?
	When interrupted by her, Jamie and Dan don’t prepare to continue talking. Dan nods slightly at her and then he turns his head to kiss gently on Jamie's forehead. Then he says, "I got to go to the company. You can go wherever you want. But be sure to come back before nine o’clock in the evening. "
	"Get it." Jamie responds obediently and her eyes are full of sweetness. She also sticks her tongue out secretly.
	When Jozo sees this scene, her hands tighten and her nails even hurt the skin. But she still maintains a warm and graceful smile.
	Are they already together?
	Well. For Jamie, just see if she has this ability!
	Dan walks past Jozo and leaves, leaving only Jamie and Jozo in the room. There is a strange and quiet atmosphere.
	Jozo moves her wheelchair forward, and her eyes become indifferent in an instant. Jozo squints at her when Jamie picks up the two bags. The smile on her face doesn’t show up in her eyes and she says softly, "Does Miss Moore have time to talk to me?"
	"I have something to do in a moment, so you can tell what you want to say." Jamie looks up at her lightly. For the woman whose appearance and inner thought are not in agreement, she has better still stay farther away.
	Who knows what bad thoughts she will have on her?
	"This is a good place to talk. I think Miss Moore must be very interested in this topic." Jozo smiles confidently, throwing bait to Jamie.
	Jamie turns around, holding the two handbags in her hand. Then she looks at Jozo curiously, "Really? Will I be curious?"
	"Yes." Not only will she be curious, but it will make her desperate!
	"I'm sorry. I'm not interested in knowing it." Jamie quickly stops her curious smile on the face, shrugging her shoulders indifferently. She places the handbags on the table and then she walks out.
	Before leaving, she leaves a sentence, "I don't want to have other smell of women in this room. If Jozo finishes your visits, please leave."
	She isn’t crazy anyway. This woman is too good at scheming. If she really stays alone with her, no one knows what will happen.
	Jozo doesn't expect Jamie to be so indifferent and she is a little surprised. The tenderness on her face becomes ruthlessness.
	"Jamie, Moore. You and I are at daggers drawn!"
	She seems to become another person and the fierceness in her voice is daunting.
	Jozo originally wants to smash all the things around her to the ground, but her sanity is still there. She knows that this is Dan's bedroom. If she really does anything, it will definitely cause Dan's dislike. And her image will be harmed. It's not worth the loss.
	Let’s wait and see. There’s still time.
	_
	Jamie returns to the hospital. When the visit time is coming, she just wants to walk in. At this time, a person comes out of the ward. He’s not a special nurse, but a person wearing a black leather coat. She cannot see his face clearly and doesn’t tell whether it’s male or female.
	Jamie stares at the man suspiciously, always feeling him familiar as if she has seen him before. But she can’t remember anything.
	She walks into the ward and places the fruit basket on the table. When she looks back, she sees Ryan leaning against the wall and looking at her tenderly.
	"Who is the person that just comes out? Is he your friend?" Ryan doesn't know many people in Country C. Even when he is hospitalized for a few days, she doesn't see his father to visit him. It’s quite strange.
	His son is hurt in this way. Even his father doesn't come to visit him. And she secretly sends a text message to the number that is remarked as his father's on his mobile phone. It stands to reason that the text message must have been received.
	If his dad reads the message, he must know Ryan’s situation. But Jamie hasn’t seen anyone come, except the stranger that she just saw and felt him familiar.
	"A friend. He just comes by to see me on a business trip. Jamie, can you cut me an apple? I want to eat an apple." Ryan says inadvertently, pointing at the fruit in the basket.
	Jamie doesn't say other thing but takes an apple in the fruit basket. Then she cuts the apple flexibly.
	Ryan looks at the apple that she hands to him. He takes a bite and says with a smile, "It's sweet. This is the sweetest fruit I have ever eaten."
	Probably because apple is cut by Jamie, so it tastes particularly sweet.
	Jamie smiles slightly and suddenly thinks of something. Her action stops, "Do you know what happen to the film's suspension?"
	She also just knows it because Wendy just asks her about this. Then she reminds of this.
	Because of her, it implicates the entire Moon. The point is that Ryan is still in the hospital. All these are because of her so she feels guilty.
	But until now, she doesn’t know why the wire was broken.
Chapter 240 I have always loved him.
	If this accident does not happen, the promotional filming is expected to be finished soon. But now it is ordered to stop its shooting and they don’t know when it can be restarted, which has greatly harmed Moon.
	"Well, I know. Fortunately Dan helps me. Otherwise Moon doesn't know how to handle it this time." Ryan smiles faintly but a little bit of hostility flashes in his eyes.
	Although he is in the hospital, he knows everything about the outside world.
	But he underestimates Jamie too much. Jamie is not the kind of girl who will easily let go of her prejudice. It is difficult for her to change what she believes.
	"It's him." Jamie smiles slightly and the smile is very subtle. And the dimples on both sides of the corner of the lips look so sweet, as if they are overflowing with honey.
	She knows why Dan goes back to help Moon. Not only because of his cooperation with Moon, but also because of her. So she is so happy.
	Ryan looks at the smile rising from the corner of her mouth. Then a sense of crisis emerges and a trace of panic crosses in his warm eyes, "Jamie, do you like him?"
	Jamie hears his question and doesn't understand it at first. But then she immediately thinks of whom he is referring to and nods calmly, "Well, yes. I have always liked him."
	She has always regarded Ryan as her good friend, so she has no worries to express her thoughts.
	"Well, does he like you too?" Ryan's eyes reflect a trace of loss. After a while, he looks directly at Jamie's eyes.
	"Of course, today we talk about it. Today I learn that he likes me too. It's so nice. The person I likes just likes me." She is so happy that she doesn't see the momentary loss of Ryan. She just has smile on her face.
	She’s like a little girl who is falling in love.
	But her look makes Ryan feel very heartbroken. Although he is laughing, he actually is a little upset.
	Ryan, who suddenly understands, has a bitter and sad simile. In Jamie's heart, he has always been a friend. It’s only he who thinks too much.
	However, he is really unwilling. He likes the girl for almost four years, and she falls into love with another man, it’s not easy for him to accept this, even if that person is her favorite man.
	"I will be relieved if he treats you well. If he dares not to treat you well, tell me at the first time. I will help you hit him." Ryan pretends to be relaxed and his smile is still gentle. However the smile doesn’t reach in his eyes. There is a trace of indifference.
	Jamie smiles and nods, "Okay, you will be my strongest backing then."
	Ryan smiles weakly. His face is full of exhaustion, "My head still aches a bit. I want to sleep for a while. Or you can go back first."
	"Headache? Does it happen again at the place that you hit?" Jamie becomes nervous at once, and stands up immediately. If he nods, she will immediately call the doctor.
	Ryan smiles at her and slowly shakes his head. "It's okay. I'm just sleepy. Don't worry."
	"Really? Don't lie to me. Just tell me where it hurts." Her clear eyes are full of worries. She watches his eyes with full guilty and feels psychologically a bit uncomfortable.
	Ryan closes his eyes, trying to avoid all these. He doesn’t want to look at her eyes, which will make him feel that he is really nothing in her heart.
	"I'm really good."
	His voice is really low. No one knows whether she is talking to Jamie, or talking to himself. He replies with a feeling of sadness.
	"Then take a good rest. I will come to see you tomorrow." Jamie smiles and then leaves the ward.
	It takes a long time after she leaves before Ryan opens her eyes and looks at the snow-white ceiling. He seems a little nervous.
	He really hopes the person she likes is him.
	_
	When Jamie gets a call from Wendy and rushes to the bar, something wrong has happened.
	The story goes roughly like this. Joey asks Wendy to come out. The location is the Blue light bar. Joey uses Duke's secret as a bait to attract Wendy to come out with her.
	Just now, a group of people are staring at the two of them. In fact, they are focusing on Joey. They want Joey to drink with them. How will Joey agree with them? Then the group begins to take action. Joey finally pushes Wendy out and let Wendy drink it for her. Those men see that Wendy also look pretty so they agree.
	Wendy was also reluctant, but Joey was Duke's favorite woman. If she is injured, Duke will be sad. Wendy doesn't want him to be sad.
	Just let her be really stupid. Wendy doesn't hesitate to take the bottles on the table and starts drinking, using alcohol to paralyze her nerves in the unbearable words of those men around her.
	After drinking, those men not only fail to keep their promises, but also become more and more energetic. They ask Joey to drink before they’re willing to let them go.
	Joey is anxious. She really can't drink. She has been allergic to alcohol since she is a child. Wendy also knows this, so she helps her with the respect of Duke.
	She really can't drink!
	Joey is forced to take the wine bottle on the table and send it to Wendy's mouth to get her drunk, "Hurry to drink all these. We can leave after you drink. You must endure it more..."
	Wendy has drunk too much and is dizzy. She glances at the wine bottle on the table. There are probably more than a dozen bottles. Even if she struggles to drink, she can never drink all of them.
	These people are clearly intending to make them drunk!
	Wendy wants to order Joey to stop. If she is drunk now, it will be her next time. Both of them will have troubles!
	But as soon as she opens her mouth, the hot liquor pours into her throat so that she cannot say a word at all.
	This stupid woman!
	Wendy is anxious extremely, reaching for the phone in her pocket. She types a text message to Jamie, and the phone accidentally falls to the ground.
	Help me.
	"Well, it's almost finished! Work harder!" Those people cheer and watch Joey keep her movement of pouring wine into Wendy’s mouth, smiling crazily.
	Wendy finally becomes drunk and blushes.
	"Hey, why are you sleeping? What should I do if you fall asleep?" Joey pats a few hard on Wendy's face, trying to wake her up. But she can’t wake her up anymore.
	"Since she can't drink anymore, then it’s your turn!" Those people push the wine bottle and smiles evilly, looking at Joey with full angles.
	There is a terrible feeling in Joey's heart, and she suddenly feels so regretful. If it isn’t for her that she wants to come to the bar on a whim, she won’t encounter these scumbags. What should she do now?
Chapter 241 We can’t become friends forever.
	Joey wants to call Duke, but these people keep staring at her. So she doesn’t know what to do.
	"I know what you want." She forces herself to calm down and takes a deep breath. "You let me go. And you can do anything you want on this woman. How is it?"
	One of them laughs and looks at Joey's eyes with some contempt. "I think she is your friend. You even betray your friends for your own sake. What the hell are you?"
	"Bitch! Hah." Those people look at Joey with a smile and daringly touch her buttocks. But she evade successfully.
	After hearing this, Joey's face changes. Her eyes turn ruthless, and she looks at Wendy in disgust. The sweet voice is a little sharp, "This woman has robbed my favorite person. We can't be friends forever!"
	She and Wendy can never be friends forever!
	"Hah, in this case, as long as you drink this bottle, we will believe you. How is it?"
	Joey's face turns pale. She looks at the bottle on the table and her fingers are trembling.
	She has secretly called Duke just now. As long as she delays it for a while, he will come to save her!
	Thinking of this, she calms down a bit in her heart and she looks at those people with a pitiful smile, "Bro, I don't refuse to drink. But I am allergic to alcohol since I am a child, so I can't drink."
	Those people are obviously attracted by her charming eyes and smile. They suddenly feel excited and they look at Joey more actively.
	At this moment, two people get their leader's hint. One of them grabs Joey's shoulder. The leader stands up to pick up the bottle on the table and pours it into Joey's mouth.
	"Hmm!" Joey's small mouth is stuffed with the wine bottle and she can’t say any word. She can only be drunk by those people. Their strength is no less than hers when Joey poured the wine to Wendy just now. It hurts her that she frowns.
	After pouring half a bottle, Joey feels that the skin on her body is hot, as if something has penetrated into her skin. It is painful and itchy. She wants to reach out and scratches it. But she can’t reach it.
	"Hah, can’t you continue with just half a bottle? Come on!"
	Joey bites her lip and refuses to drink. She can’t drink. She will have a rash if she drinks. She doesn’t want to be so disgusting!
	"Open her mouth!" The leader points at Joey's lips. The two men stretch out a hand and forcibly open Joey's mouth to continue pouring.
	Wendy opens her eyes slightly and her consciousness is a little confused. Her eyelids are heavy but she still knows what is going on. Now she is weak and her limbs cannot be lifted, as if they are filled with heavy lead.
	Even if she is strong now, she won't help Joey anymore.
	Although she is drunk just now, she can still hear what they talk. Joey's words, which like a slap, hit on her face hard.
	It makes her know that she is an idiot and is so naive!
	"Um, Duke, save me ..." Joey tries hard to avoid their wine bottles and spits out few words intermittently. Her small face is covered with tears, but it doesn’t cause those people to be sympathy. But instead they’re even more rampant.
	Wendy stands up unsteadily and shakes her head vigorously, trying to see the scene clearly in front of her.
	She wants to ignore Joey. But if she doesn’t care about her, it’s very likely that she will die here today. Even if it’s not for Duke, she just can’t see one being killed in front of her!
	Wendy clenches her hands and she runs into those people cruelly, beating some people down. Joey is also relieved, and her face has a dense red rash, which looks terrible.
	"Why do you freeze here? Go!" Wendy pulls Joey's hand according to circumstances and takes her towards the corner.
	Those men scold angrily and chase after them. Finally they catch up with them in a few steps.
	"Bitches! Let me see where you can go!" Those people grab Joey's wrist and pull them back, making Wendy and Joey feel desperate with their vicious look.
	Should they be ended here today?
	"No! Don't touch me!" Joey throws away those people's hands violently and shouts silently. Her mind is almost collapse.
	"Bitches! Come on and take her away!" The leader points at Joey and orders to those people.
	Those men let go of Wendy's hand without hesitation and turn to pull Joey.
	Wendy stuns. How will they let her go so easily?
	She has no time to think about it, and she glances at Joey, who is struggling with those people. She turns to look for rescuers.
	Her cell phone just falls off. Only when she runs out can she find someone for help!
	But when she turns around, she sees a tall figure approaching in a rapid pace.
	She looks carefully. It is Duke!
	She intends to cry and there are tears in her eyes. She walks to Duke in a messy pace.
	As she approaches Duke, Duke passes her without squinting at her and walks to Joey.
	With anxiety and fierceness in his eyes, when he sees the fragile and helpless figure in the crowd, his body trembles fiercely. He can’t control his anger anymore, and lifts his feet to kick several people in a row.
	"Who the hell are you?" When the people look back angrily, they see a gloomy and cold face with full anger. It seems that his anger is about to overwhelm everyone.
	Joey sees Duke outside the crowd, and raises her head in tears. She looks at him and the tears drop down, "Duke, Duke ..."
	There is a pain in Duke's chest, and there is a layer of anger in his eyes. He lifts his legs to kick, turns sideways and kicks those people down on the ground. The strength is so fast and accurate that those people can just yell.
	Wendy is frightened by his fierce appearance. She has never seen Duke so angry. At any time he is indifferent, as if he is not interested in anything. But now, he is angry for one woman.
	It’s unable to tell whether it is sad or lost in her heart. Wendy thinks that God probably wants her to see it clearly. The things that don’t belong to her will never belong to her. No matter how much she loves him, he will never belong to her.
	"Don't beat them anymore. They will die if you keep beating again!" Wendy finds that the situation is wrong and makes herself not think about it. She rushes over and grabs Duke's hand, preventing him from taking the next step.
	The temperature on the arm actually makes Duke stunned slightly. It’s really... a familiar feeling.
	"Duke, I'm scared ..." Joey exposes a bit of jealousy in her eyes, staring at Wendy's hand which holds Duke's arm for a moment. She makes a frightened voice and pulls back Duke's thoughts.
Chapter 242 A secret crush on him
	Duke's eyes freeze but he takes his hand away without hesitation and strides towards Joey.
	Wendy looks at her palm with a trace of his temperature remaining at her fingertips.
	She looks at Duke's back as he walks towards Joey, and she suddenly raises an extremely beautiful smile.
	Goodbye, my secret love that can’t be said.
	Goodbye, Duke, you are the one I love since I first sees you in that year.
	Before Wendy's smile disappears, her body collapses and she falls backwards.
	"Lady, what's the matter with you?" The clear voice flows into Wendy's ears like the water flows through. Before her last consciousness disappears, she hears a voice that is melodious and unforgettable to her.
	She knows that it must not be Duke.
	When Jamie rushes to Blue light, Duke has taken Joey away. He just misses with them so he doesn't meet them.
	Jamie opens her phone anxiously to find out Wendy's number. She makes a call, and it doesn’t connect. But Jamie hears a subtle music sound coming from somewhere.
	It is the sound of Wendy mobile phone ringtone.
	She follows the sound of the cell phone ringtone and finds Wendy's cell phone in a corner. The corner is in a mess, and there is a few of blood on the ground.
	Her eyes shrink sharply. Does Wendy have an accident?
	Before thinking, she immediately finds Dan's number and dials it. Listening to the beep from her cell phone, she really wishes to follow the line to find Dan.
	After a few seconds, there is a connection there. Dan's cold voice comes, "Jamie?"
	At this time, he is in a meeting, and a group of company executives sits in front of him. The mobile phone is supposed to be set to vibrate. However, in this mobile phone, only Jamie's number is stored so there is no vibrating.
	As soon as the cell phone rings, the executives watch over, and Dan answers the phone quickly.
	Jamie's eyes are a little bit sore, and she says with a cry, "Dan, help me. Wendy has an accident ..."
	Dan hears Jamie's cry on the phone, frowning fiercely. There is a little fluster in his heart. He gestures to stop a minister who is making a report. "Jamie, don't worry. Tell me where you are now. "
	The executives look at Dan with surprise and curiosity. Who is the president talking to? Actually he is so patient and ... gentle!
	Can you believe it?
	"I'm in the Blue light. Will you come over soon?" Jamie sniffs, knowing that crying at this time is useless. The first thing she should do is to find Wendy.
	"Okay, wait for me." Dan finishes the sentence and hangs up the phone. Then she stands up and walks outside.
	When he walks to the door, he suddenly remembers something, and throws a sentence to the executives behind him, "The meeting is suspended. The report should be prepared and sent to my mailbox."
	After that, he opens the glass door and walks away. The several executive look at each other and are all confused.
	_
	Jamie can’t wait for Dan to come. She calls the manager of the bar and asks them to take the surveillance video to find where Wendy has gone. But no matter how she asks, the manager just says that this is a personal affair so they can't do this.
	"My friend has an accident in your bar. Do you want to avoid responsibility or are you a partner of them? I just want to look at the monitor to see where my friend is!" Jamie can’t help raising her voice. Looking at the fat manager in front of her, she only feels angry and wants to fight him.
	If violence can be used to solve problems, she doesn't want to be polite at all!
	The more time she wastes, the more dangerous Wendy will be!
	The manager is already impatient and is a little annoyed by Jamie's words. So he stretches out his hand and pushes Jamie back, "I tell you that we can't. Why do you keep bothering me here? Go to other place!"
	Jamie is pushed by him violently and leans back without quick reaction.
	She thinks she can’t escape the fate of falling down. At this time, a big palm supports her slender back and steadily lifts her.
	Jamie turns her head in surprise and rejoices burst into her eyes. It’s Dan.
	"Mr. William ..." The manager doesn't expect Dan to appear suddenly and obviously he knows Dan. Moreover, he is afraid of him and his face makes a flattering smile.
	Dan embraces Jamie's thin waist with one hand and narrowly looks at the manager coldly. His thin lips purses, "Which hand do you use to push her just now?"
	The manager is sweating straightly on his head, and he doesn't dare to look directly into his eyes. He just feels terrified. If he knows Dan cares this girl in advance, he won’t dare to push her!
	"Mr. William, I’m wrong. I promise that I will never do this again." The manager gives a truckling smile and almost puts his face in front of Dan. But he doesn't dare to approach him at all.
	Dan glances at him with a horrible eye, and pressures him silently.
	"Left, left hand ..." The manager widens his eyes in horror, swallowing saliva instinctively.
	Dan's lips are half-hooked, and his cold eyes stop on the manager's left hand. No one knows when does he grab the manager's left hand's wrist and fold it hard!
	"Ah--" A sudden pain hit him that the manager is trembling with pain. He shouts and the flesh on his abdomen cannot stop shaking. The scene is quite funny.
	"This is a warning." Dan lets go of his hand and throws the manager away. He takes out a handkerchief to wipe his palm carefully, including his fingers.
	Jamie is moved. But when she sees his action of wiping, she couldn't help but chuckle. This man twists the wrists of others and still thinks other’s hand is too dirty! He is so handsome and cool!
	"Dan, let's look at the surveillance video. I'm afraid Wendy will be in danger." She pulls his clothes and asks.
	"Well." His eyebrows turn tender significantly when facing her. But when he turns his head, it becomes cold again, "Lead the way."
	"Yes, yes." The manager has his wrist broken, but he doesn't dare to go to the doctor even if it hurts. He leads them in front.
	In the surveillance video, Wendy and Joey choose a corner. But there is a camera facing the corner, and they can hear what they said.
	The more she sees the more anger on Jamie's face shows. Finally she hits the desktop hard, and her small face is full of anger. She is hoping to rush into the screen to grab Joey out to fight.
	"Damn! This Joey is not a good person. She actually uses my Wendy to exchange for safety. I have never seen such a shameless woman. Is Duke a blind person that he can fall in love with her?"
	Listening to her shouting voice, Dan is helpless and takes the hand she just hits the table. He rubs it gently in his palm. Duke has a girlfriend and he knows it. But he has never seen her. Jamie’s words shows that she is angry and pitiful.
Chapter 243 It’s his freedom to love anyone.
	He narrows his eyes and turns Jamie's face to him, letting her look at him, "Why do you care about who Duke loves?"
	"Can’t I care?" Jamie frowns.
	Dan's face suddenly darkens.
	"He is a person Wendy likes. But with such a good girl like Wendy, he doesn't like her but likes a selfish and hypocritical woman. Is he blind?" Jamie is angry for a while, but she forgets the relationship between Dan and Duke before blurting out these words.
	Dan's face eases a bit and he nods thoughtfully. Just now he also sees what Wendy did in order to save Joey. He also agrees with Jamie's words. But Duke is his bro since childhood after all. It’s his freedom to love anyone.
	He just doesn't expect that it will involve so many things.
	Jamie feels a little regretful after saying this. She carefully looks at Dan's face and bites her lower lip. She says a little nervously, "Dan, what I just said is out of anger. Won’t you be angry? "
	Dan turns his eyes to see her bright and clear eyes. His heart softens and he raises his arms to rub her hair. Only then does he discover how she calls him.
	Dan.
	This should be the first time she calls him in this tone.
	After watching the surveillance video, Dan and Jamie takes the video tape just in case that it may be useful in the future.
	Wendy is not in danger, but is taken away by a man who is fashionable and elegant in dress, who doesn't look like a bad guy.
	But if he is a bad person, will he show that he is a bad person on his face? There are many beasts in human attire.
	"Dan, I feel worried about Wendy. Can you let me go with you to find her?" After listening to Dan's order to Derek, Jamie tugs at his sleeve and tries to discuss with him.
	"No." Dan refuses without thinking, and Jamie's small face instantly dims. He can’t finally bear it. So he coughs and says, "Relax. Wendy will not be in danger. That man is the young master of the Charlies Family in the city A. he is upright and self-disciplined. Therefore the problems you worry about will never happen. "
	With that, he reaches out and knocks on Jamie's head. "What are you thinking in your head?"
	Jamie's eyes light up. Those who can get few good comments from Dan will not be bad. That is to say, Wendy will be fine with that person.
	The Charlies? It sounds familiar and she seems to have heard of...
	"Dan, thank you. If it isn't for you, I don't know how to do." Jamie smiles sincerely and spits out her tongue playfully. There is always a sense of security when being around him. No matter what happens to her, he will arrive as soon as possible.
	Dan raises her eyebrows and smiles and looks at her. "Thanks can't be expressed by words."
	"So what do you want?" Jamie blinks a few times, suddenly feeling a little dangerous and trying to back away. But she is leaning on the door of the car and there is nowhere to escape.
	"What do you think?" He leans slightly closer to her and his warm breath sprays on her, which causes her to shiver.
	Jamie blushes and she doesn't know where she can look at. It is absolutely impossible to say that she has no tension but her heart seems to be about to beat out of her chest. She is annoyed to hold it down so that it won’t beat so fast.
	The temperature in the car increases as their lips are pressed together. Finally the kiss stops when Jamie is suffocating.
	Dan closes his eyes narrowly, leaving her soft lips with dissatisfaction. His lips slightly raise, "When will you know how to breathe?"
	When he says this, Jamie's pretty face is even redder and she glares angrily at him. "Obviously, it’s you who are not good at kissing. Then why do you blame me that I won’t breathe?"
	In fact, this is her angry word. His kiss skills are really excellent. She will be dizzy and turns to be confused every time when he kisses her and there is no way to resist his kiss.
	But ... She just won't breathe. Is there anything wrong with this?
	Dan's black eyes narrow dangerously and he stares at her pink pretty face to slowly approach, "What are you talking about?"
	Jamie shakes her head desperately when she sees that the situation goes wrong. "I don't say anything. I say that your skill is very good. It's the best I've ever seen!"
	"The best you've ever seen?" His deep black eyes are even more dangerous. Every time he can accurately catch the bugs in her words.
	Jamie is so anxious to beat herself. She doesn't have time to explain that she learns this from the TV, and her lips are blocked again by him.
	It seems that on this skill, she does not want to win him.
	_
	The next day, Jamie and Dan go to work together. Since she doesn’t come back for too long, there are not many issues left to her. Everything has to be done step by step. If it is too eager to succeed, it will be counterproductive.
	Jamie wants to know Wendy's news. She originally draws the design draft in the office next to Dan. After drawing, she will give them to Dan to check. But in order to know Wendy's news, she has to draw a picture and takes it to him.
	The president's office can't be entered except for her and Secretary Sam. Secretary Sam will not disturb them so stupidly for her year-end bonus and holidays.
	Jamie appears in front of Dan from time to time, trying to remind him of Wendy.
	But what happens is contrary to her wish. She has been wandering around in the president's office for a whole morning, and there is no sign of Dan talking.
	Does he forget? Jamie walks into her office and stops her steps, hammering her head in annoyance.
	Although her speed is quick, she has already handed over several paintings. In this way, her fingers will be harmed to cramp.
	How should she do?
	Coffee!
	Jamie's eyes light up suddenly, and she remembers that when she leaves Dan's office she sees that the coffee on his table is almost drunk. She can go inside with this excuse!
	Jamie, who thinks of a method, can’t help but become happy. She sings a song in her mouth and walks out of the office. Then she goes to the tea room on this floor to make coffee.
	The coffee Dan drinks is made from coffee beans, and two packs of creamer should be added. Otherwise he will not be able to drink it.
	Jamie used to be bullied by Katt when she is in FS. It is clearly the hand of drawing the design draft but it is used to make coffee.
	She also makes it every day. Jamie's coffee has a taste that no other coffee has, so Katt only likes her coffee.
	She turns on the switch of the hot water and gets some hot water in the cup. Then she picks it up and places it on the table. Instead of adding creamer, she replaces the creamer with fresh milk. Then she gently stirs it with a porcelain spoon.
Chapter 244 Chestnut cake
	After that, she walks into Dan William's office with a cup of coffee in her hand.
	Dan William sits behind the huge desk, and he is looking at the documents. He signs his name at the bottom of the documents from time to time, and then puts it aside.
	He is very serious when he works. His eyebrows wrinkle and stretch with his mood. All his attention is on these documents.
	He lowers down his head to look at the documents, and then he sees a cup of coffee appear in front of him. He looks at the slender hand, and then he sees the smiling face of Jamie Moore.
	He puts down the pen on his hand. He looks at the warm coffee cup, and then he looks at Jamie Moore. He leans back in a lazy way. "Is there any medicine in the coffee?"
	The confident face of Jamie Moore changes suddenly, and then she stares at him, “Would you like to drink it? If you don't drink, I'll give it to others."
	She makes this coffee by herself, and there are only a few people who have enjoyed this. But now he says such a word, and he even doesn’t show any respect to her.
	She reaches out to take the coffee cup, but she is stopped by one hand, and then the coffee cup is taken away.
	Dan William holds the coffee cup in his hand, and smells the aroma of the coffee. He takes a sip of the coffee, and the taste of the coffee is mellow and thick. The coffee flows through his tongue, which is as smooth as silk.
	Dan William is a little surprised, and he never expects that the taste of the coffee is so good. It’s more delicious than any coffee he had drunk.
	"Does the coffee taste well?” Jamie Moore looks at his action with beautiful eyes. She is looking forward that Dan William would say something to her.
	Please tell the thing happened to Wendy to her. Please tell all the things to her quickly!
	Dan William wears a smile on the corner of his mouth. Jamie Moore goes back and forth in his office. He knows what she wants to do, and he just wants to tease her, so he pretends not to see her inquiry eyes.
	"Well, the coffee drinks well." He puts down the coffee cup, and then he picks up the pen beside him, and continues to read the document.
	So?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she looks at Dan William with resentment, “Dan William, do you forget something?”
	"Do I forget something?" Dan William answers without looking at Jamie Moore. His eyes are always on the document. He frowns, and it seems that he is thinking of something.
	“Wendy…”
	Dan William looks up before Jamie Moore finishes her words. He narrows his eyes, and then he looks at Jamie Moore with a smile, “What’s up? I suddenly want to eat chestnut cake..."
	Jamie Moore’s eyes suddenly become bright. She knows the meaning in his words!
	"I'll buy it for you now!" she walks to the door as she finishes her words. She is very happy now.
	Dan William shakes his head and chuckles helplessly, and then the smile on his face disappears gradually, "Come in."
	The door of the office is opened after a few seconds. A cold dark figure walks to Dan William, but there is no sound on the ground. It’s very quiet. If someone doesn’t see the figure, he may think it’s just a projection.
	"Young master." Derek William stands in front of Dan William, and then he bows his head and says respectfully.
	"Have you got the answer?" Dan William signs his name at the bottom of a document after browsing it, and then he puts it aside.
	"Yes. Through investigation, I found that it was the master of the Charlies Family who saves Miss Wendy. He took Wendy to his apartment. Mr. Duke had killed those people of last night. And none of them have been left behind.” Derek William says coldly. He always keeps calm, and no one could melt the cold atmosphere around him.
	Eddie Charlies?
	Dan William narrows his eyes. Is it really him?
	Eddie Charlies, Dan William, Duke Field, and Bruce Hill are good friends. He once lives in the home of Duke Field for a long time, and the relationship between Eddie Charlies and Duke Field is very good. The relationship of them is good enough to wear the same clothes. But then something bad happened between them, thus Eddie Charlies disappears from their life.
	He never expects that they will meet each other five years later.
	"There is no need to investigate it now, and get everyone back." Dan William looks at the screen of the computer, and he clicks on the keyboard quickly. He is very calm and his eyes are cool.
	Although Derek William is confused, he doesn’t ask more. Then he answers, “Yes.”
	-
	Jamie Moore waits for a taxi as soon as she leaves the CR building.
	A taxi stops in front of her, and she gets into the taxi without any hesitation, and then she gives the address to the driver.
	There is a strange smell in the car. It's not thick or light. Jamie Moore wants to open the window for fresh air, but her mouth and nose is suddenly covered by someone. She faints before she gets her sense.
	Dan William puts the pen in his hand down an hour later. He frowns, and then he looks at the closed glass door, and a suspicion appeared in his eyebrow.
	He stands up, and then kicks the chair behind him away. Then he walks toward the office of Jamie Moore.
	Her office is clean and bright. There are several green succulent plants on the desk. A stack of drawings are placed in front of the computer at will. The windows are open, and the drawings are messed up by the wind.
	Dan William walks to the table, and then he picks a folder on the desktop and puts it on the painting, so that the drawing will not be blown away.
	Jamie Moore is not in the office, and it seems that she hasn’t come back yet.
	She worries about Wendy so much, thus she will never waste any time to know the information related to Wendy. What’s more, the Grapefruit Street is not far from here. It only takes half an hour to go back and forth.
	So where is she?
	The heart of Dan William thumps for several times, and uneasiness appeared in his heart. Then he takes out his mobile phone from his trouser pocket, and then he gives a phone to Jamie Moore.
	There is a busy tone in the cell phone, and the phone is not answered.
	Jamie Moore always carries her cell phone, and she will turn the phone off only when she falls asleep or the phone is out of power. It's rare that she doesn't answer the phone.
	He worries in his heart. Dan William doesn’t hang up, and he puts the phone in his ear. He walks to the elevator after getting out of the office.
	He has a hunch that something wrong has happened to Jamie Moore.
	-
	The taxi drives for a long time. When the effect of the medicine on Jamie Moore passed, the car stops in front of an abandoned warehouse.
	The two men drag Jamie Moore out of the car and take her to the warehouse.
	The warehouse is dark and humid, so you can only see the route of the warehouse by the light from the outside.
	Jamie Moore is dragged to the warehouse by them. Her calves are cut by the broken stones on the ground, and her mind also become clear.
	She opens her eyes slightly, and she only sees a pool of black water with disgusting smell on the ground. She frowns, and she feels that the pain on her legs is more hurting than before, which dispels the remaining confusion in her brain completely.
	Where is this?
	She endures the pain on her calves, and she tries all her effort to keep quiet, so that these people will not notice her.
	Is she kidnapped?
	She moves her hands, but her hand is tied tightly by the rope. And her legs are also tied tightly by the rope.
	Jamie Moore is a little flustered. After being kidnapped by Mia Moore last time, she is very careful now. When she takes the taxi, she would write down the license plate number. But this time, she forgets to do this. Who knows these people would use the same tricks. They faints her with the medicine, and then they kidnap her.
Chapter 245 Do they think too high of her?
	Do they think too high of her?
	She dares not to say something. She takes a deep breath to make her heart beat less quickly. And then she closes her eyes, and pretends that she is still sleeping.
	The two men drag Jamie Moore into the warehouse, and then they loosen their hand. Thus the body of Jamie Moore falls on the ground. Jamie Moore’s face is on the ground. Fortunately, here is no broken stone here, or she would be disfigured.
	"Brother, we have taken this woman here. Now we can ask money from that man.” One of the men says. They don’t lower their voice, and they say in an original voice.
	Sure enough, someone kidnap her, but who would this person be?
	Jamie Moore holds her breath, and she listens carefully.
	"What else do you want to say? I’m the leader, and you are my subordinate. Take a chair for me quickly. The gang leader stares at his subordinate. He looks at the surrounding environment, and then he sneers.
	"OK, OK, OK. I will totally listen to you." The subordinate smiles, and then he pulls out a worn-out chair from the corner of the warehouse. He wipes the dust on it, and then he asks his brother to sit on it.
	The brother sniffs, and then he sits down rudely, and the chair under him gives a sharp "creak" sound.
	"Boss, what should we do now?" The subordinate looks at Jamie Moore nervously. He is a little afraid. Kidnapping is against the law. If it isn't for the money given by that man, he and his boss wouldn't do this dangerous business.
	Fortunately, that man just asks them to let her stay here for a while. If that man asks them to do other thing, they don't have any courage to do this.
	"We can’t do anything, and we can only wait for the phone.” The leader rolls at his subordinate. Then he leans against the chair, and it seems that he has fallen asleep.
	The subordinate feels that it’s not good to stand there still, thus he also pulls out a chair from that corner. He sits not far away from his leader, and then he also falls asleep.
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes when she hears the steady breathing of them.
	They even can’t contact that man and can just wait until that man contacts them. How thoughtful is this person's mind! That man is so cautious.
	It’s too dark in the warehouse. The sunshine can only shine into the room through the two windows on the top of the warehouse.
	Her hands and feet are tied tightly, thus she can’t move. She struggles for several times, but it is useless. Besides, this consumes her strength. What’s more, now she lies on the ground, which hinders her activities.
	From the words of the two people, she knows that the kidnapper will call them again. Although she wants to know the kidnapper, she has no way to deal with current situation.
	Does she offend anyone? Mia Moore has disappeared, so it can't be her. Emily Lin has been sent to other place by Dan William, so it also can’t be her. It seems that she doesn't offend anyone recently. How could she be kidnapped for no reason?
	Is the kidnapper Amelia?
	It's seems impossible. Amelia is a stupid girl, and she can't have such a plan. She even dares not to kill chickens, let alone kidnapping someone. Everyone knows that the man who is kidnapped is usually hard to survive. If they don't do the things according to the words of the kidnappers, they will be torn up easily. Only a few people can leave there alive.
	Even if Jamie dies here, others would only think it’s a simple kidnapping.
	Who is so vicious? Why do they want to kill her?
	For a while, Jamie Moore’s mind goes blank. She doesn't know what to do. She thinks for a while with her eyes opened. The handsome face of Dan William comes to her mind…
	At the same time, Dan William stands in the monitoring room of CR. He looks at every screen quickly and carefully. Jamie Moore leaves an hour ago. Here are the monitoring videos in the CR building an hour ago.
	Although the time range has been shortened, the CR building is too large. It's very difficult for Dan William to find Jamie Moore from so many surveillance videos.
	Derek William stands beside Dan William, and he is looking at the screen quietly.
	The sight of Dan William is very good. He just needs to take a glance at the screen and then he can shift to next video. After looking at the video for a long time, Dan William finally finds the figure of Jamie Moore.
	On the screen, Jamie Moore takes the elevator to the first floor, and then she leaves the CR building! Then she is waiting for a taxi. The screen stops here, because the CR building only records the thing happened in the whole building, and there are surveillance videos in places of the roadside.
	"Derek William, now you should get all the surveillance videos of this road for me. Besides, you send someone to intercept all the taxis starting from this road, and I will give you five minutes to do this." Dan William says in a calm and steady way, and it seems that he is not worried about this. But in fact, he holds the corner of the table tightly.
	Jamie Moore doesn't have a car, so she would definitely wait for the taxi on the roadside. There are many taxis on this road, so Jamie Moore must have taken a taxi.
	If he calls all the surveillance video up, and controls the routine of all taxis, it will be easy for him to find Jamie Moore.
	"Yes." Derek William comes to finish the order of Dan William immediately.
	What’s more, Dan William asks somebody to block city A. No matter in the airport, the railway station or the high-speed railway, there are some people guard there strictly. As long as Jamie doesn’t leave City A, she is safe.
	The whole city A also has a temporary traffic paralysis for the action of Dan William.
	But Dan William has no time to worry about the opinions of other people. Derek William takes the video tape for him quickly. After adjusting the time for a while, they finally see the taxi number that Jamie Moore takes.
	It’s a taxi, but the license of that taxi is counterfeit, so Dan William doesn’t find out anything.
	Although the license of that car is counterfeit, it is a real taxi. As long as they could find out which taxi company misses a car, they can find out the location of that car.
	Finally, as long as they find the license of the taxi, Dan William immediately launches a tracking to determine the final location of the car.
	It's in an abandoned warehouse at the foot of Yam Mountain. The signal is very weak. The signal is broken after flashing for a few seconds. Fortunately, Dan William records the location.
	He couldn't wait any longer. He closes the laptop hardly, and then he throws the laptop aside. Then he starts the car, and rushes out quickly.
	Citizen in the Country A is in a panic because of the unexpected block of the Country A. They all think that something bad has happened to Country A. Every entrance and exit is very crowded. None of the people can leave Country C under the supervision of the bodyguard of Dan William.
	"Is Dan William crazy? Why does he block the whole Country A?” Bruce Hill is surprised when he hears the news. He couldn't believe that the cold and proud man would do it.
	It's crazy!
	"Who knows, but something must have happened." Although Duke Field is also surprised, but he doesn’t like Bruce Hill, thus he sends a text message calmly.
	"No, something bad must have happened. I have to check it." Bruce Hill picks the coat on the clothes shelf up as he walks away, and then he walks out.
	He likes gossip, and this kind of thing is so rare, thus he must have a look.
Chapter 246 Take off her clothes and take photos for her?
	Duke Field shakes his head. He doesn’t stop him, and then he continues to look at the phone.
	He spends much more time to look at the phone after falling in love with Joey Lan. This time is much longer than the time he spends on looking at the documents.
	-
	In the abandoned warehouse at the foot of Yam mountain
	The warehouse is very quiet. Even the weak sound of dropping water can be amplified several times and then spread to the ear.
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes, and she dares not to open her eyes. She is afraid that if she falls asleep, this two people would do something bad to her. Thus she dares not to relax for a moment.
	The warehouse is very big and there is a lot of water. The only way to get out of here is the gate. But the place where these two people sit blocks the gate. If she wants to pass the gate, she even cannot disturb them.
	But now…
	Her hands and feet are tied tightly, and she can’t stand up, let alone walking out of here.
	Suddenly, an idea flashes in her mind, and then she moves her body little by little. She moves toward the place where there are broken stones.
	The noise of the friction between the cloth and the ground is especially obvious in the dead warehouse. Jamie Moore can just move slowly to avoid making loud sound.
	Fortunately, the stone is not far away from her. After moving for a while, Jamie Moore finally moves to the stone.
	She tries all her strength to grasp the stone with the tied hand. Originally, it’s very easily for her to grasp the stone. But her wrist is tied tightly, thus it’s not easy for her to do this.
	A layer of sweat falls from her bright and clean forehead. She keeps reaching for the stone, and finally she grasps it in her hand.
	Jamie Moore relieves slightly, and then she holds the stone with her hand, and then she cuts the rope with the stone in her hand.
	The rope is about as thick as the thumb. Although the stone is sharp, it is not easy to cut the rope.
	She tries all her efforts to cut the rope with the stone. Her wrist is cramped because she keeps the same action for a long time. She stops for a while, and then she continues.
	"Ding..." A sharp and violent cell phone ring sounds suddenly, breaking the original atmosphere of silence. Jamie Moore is so shocked that the stone in her hand almost fall to the ground.
	Then two man wake up suddenly, and they looks for their phone hurriedly.
	"Hello? Yes, we have caught this woman. When will we get the money? ...What? Take off her clothes and take photos for her? I remember that I just needs to take this woman here, am I right? …Give me more money? How much? …OK, I know it. But you need to ensure our safety. We should leave here safely when everything is OK!” The leader says to the mobile phone, and there is a little uneasiness on his face.
	Take off her clothes and take photos for her?
	The sight of Jamie Moore is very cold. Her face is against the cold ground, and she could hear the words of them clearly.
	Who is the kidnapper? He is so cruel! He even wants to destroy the reputation of her!
	The subordinate looks at his leader worriedly after hanging up. He hesitates for a while, “Boss, do we really need to do this? He will give money to us when we take this woman here, am I right?”
	"He will give us much money! Anyway, we have done such thing. It’s impossible for us to go back. If we listen to the word of that man, we can still get a lot of money and then leave here later!" The leader gnashes his teeth and says ruthlessly. Although he knows that it would violate the law, what the man said is right, they had already violated the law when they kidnap others, and the man would send them away when the thing has done.
	Thinking of here, the two men have more courage to do this.
	"Bossr, she wakes up now!" The subordinate finds Jamie Moore’s eyes are opened, thus he points at her and shouts.
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes on purpose. She holds her hand tightly, and then she hides the stone in her hand. The hard edges hurt her palm, but she still wears a smile on her face. She says tentatively, "I can give you a lot of money. How about letting me go?"
	The leader gives hint to his subordinate through eye contact. The subordinate walks to pick Jamie Moore up immediately, and lets Jamie Moore sit on the ground with her legs curled up.
	"How much can you give us?" The subordinate is intrigued, and he asks Jamie Moore hurriedly.
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes. The fact is that they just want money. Now she should calm them down and. When Dan William finds that she is missing, he would find her.
	"How much do you want?"
	"1 million dollars!" The subordinate says. The reward that the man gives them is only five hundred thousand dollars.
	Jamie Moore sighs in her heart. It's a daylight robbery. 1 million dollars! Does her life only worth 1 million dollars?
	No…It seems very strange.
	"OK, but you need to let me go first, and then I can let other people to remit money to you." Jamie Moore says briskly.
	The subordinate is very happy. At the time that they get the money from that man, they will also get the money from this woman. It must be a big fortune.
	Thinking of here, the subordinate walks to loosen the rope on Jamie Moore’s body without any hesitation.
	"Wait." The leader stops the action of the subordinate suddenly. He looks at Jamie Moore's eyes with gloomy, and it seems that he doesn’t believe Jamie Moore’s word.
	Jamie Moore shivers, and the feeling of uneasiness overwhelms her whole heart gradually.
	"You are stupid!" The leader walks to his subordinate, and then he gives a slap to him. Then he says ruthlessly, “Please think about this. If we let her go, wouldn't she ask help from police? At that time, we may lose our life before we get so much money!”
	The subordinate looks at the leader in shock. He doesn't think of this at all. Compared with money, life is more important.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips hardly, and her eyes are full of the confusion. She keeps cutting the rope with the stone in her hand constantly. She shouts in her heart, “Please break quickly. Please break quickly."
	But the quality of the rope is so good. Jamie Moore almost hurts her hand, but the rope is still good.
	“Go, please take off her clothes. Arrange the clothes in a casual way, and I will take photos for her.” The leader pats his subordinate’s shoulder, and then he takes out his cell phone.
	"OK, OK, OK." Now the subordinate obeys the order of the leader without any objection. He walks to Jamie Moore, and he prepares to cut the rope on Jamie Moore's hand with a knife. Then he suddenly finds the stone on Jamie Moore's hand, and he finds the rope tied on her hand is almost broken.
	"Boss, this woman wants to cut the rope with the stone, and then she wants to escape!” the subordinate pulls out the stone in Jamie Moore’s hand, and then he throws the stone away.
	"What? Damn, I know that this woman doesn’t want to give money to us! What are you waiting for? Hurry up!" The leader glares at Jamie Moore, and then he orders his subordinate to finish his action quickly.
	"Don't come here. I can give you money. It's only 1 million dollars. I'll send it to you now!" Jamie Moore is in a panic. The uneasiness in her eyes is just like ink dripping on rice paper. She immediately protects herself tightly after she gets rid of the rope tied on her hands.
	She can’t let them do such things to her. She can’t bear this, even if she will die!
	"Just do it. That’s a load of crap!” The leader kicks impatiently with fierce eyes. It seems that he is warning Jamie Moore. He warns that if she continues to say something, he will kill her.
Chapter 247 You can’t let them get away with it easily, even if you will die
	"Yes!" The subordinate is very excited. He looks at the delicate and beautiful woman in front of him. Any man will be tempted as soon as he sees such a beautiful woman.
	Jamie Moore frowns. She disgusts the dirty eyes from them. But her legs are still tied, thus she feels very helpless.
	The subordinate walks to hold Jamie Moore’s hand with his hand, and then he pulls Jamie Moore’s clothes with another hand.
	"Don't touch me! You are such a bastard! Take away your dirty hands!" Jamie Moore is in a panic. She tries all her effort to get rid of the hand of that man, and then she gives that man a slap!
	She doesn’t have such helpless feeling for a long time. Now she just likes fish on the chopping board, which can be butchered at will!
	This feeling is so terrible!
	"Bitch! How dare you hit me?" the subordinate gets angry in an instant. He holds Jamie Moore’s clothes hardly, and he wants to tear Jamie Moore’s clothes up.
	Jamie Moore, you should remember the face of those people. You can’t let them get away with it easily, even if you will die.
	Jamie Moore bites his lower lip desperately. Tears fall from the corner of her eyes. Her sight suddenly becomes fierce. She suddenly jumps forward, and then bites the arm of that man.
	She bites hardly, and she doesn’t want to loosen her teeth.
	"Ah, ah! My hand, open your mouth. Open your mouth quickly!” The subordinate feels very pain. Jamie Moore is always so fierce, thus no one could bear it. What’s more, she bites that man with all her strength, and it seems that a piece of meat would be bitten off by her.
	Seeing this, the leader puts his cell phone away, and then he walks to kick Jamie Moor away.
	As the leader kicks Jamie Moore away, a large piece of meat of the subordinate’s arm is torn off. It seems very terrible, and the red blood flows down the arm.
	"Ah…It hurts me so much, my hand…" The subordinate breathes in pain. He almost cries when he looks at his arm.
	Oh!
	Jamie Moore sneers coldly, and then she tries all her efforts to wipe the blood on her mouth. Her whole body is very painful.
	The kick from the gang leader almost breaks her heart up. A faint smell of blood comes up from her throat. She doesn’t wipe the blood on her mouth, instead, the blood on the corners of her mouth flows more.
	Bang——
	The door of the warehouse is opened suddenly, making a heavy sound. The sunlight comes in through the door, thus one could see the situation inside clearly.
	Jamie Moore raises her eyelids, but her vision is a little fuzzy. She looked at it intently, and then she sees a tall and slender figure coming towards her. Step by step, that figure is getting closer and closer.
	Is it him?
	As soon as Jamie Moore has this idea in her mind, she closes her eyes completely, and then she faints.
	"Jamie, Jamie?" The sight of Dan William changes suddenly. When he finds Jamie Moore lying on the ground with blood on her mouth, he feels that his heart seemed to be held tightly by a big hand, which makes him feel suffocated.
	"How can it be?" Two men think that this location is very remote, thus other people could not find here. How could they find here?
	The atmosphere around Dan William is very cold. He holds his hand tightly. His anger is ignited in an instant, spreading like a fire.
	He turns sideways, and then kicks two men to the ground. Then he beats them with all of his strength, and he wants to vent his anger by this!
	He beats them so hard, and the fact is that he wants to kill them. He beats with all his strength, and he beats them severely.
	The two men feel very painful for the beating by Dan William, but they can’t cry. Dan William doesn’t reduce his strength, but he beats them heavier than before.
	"What's the matter?" Bruce Hill and Duke Field is shocked when they see the situation. How could Dan William beat people in such an unskilled way?
	Duke Field gets his sense first, and then he pats on the head of Bruce Hill. Then he says, “Don’t be an onlooker, or they will lose their life!”
	Then Bruce Hill gets his sense. He walks forward to pulls Dan William’s hand, “Dan, stop beating them. It's not worth dirtying your hands for these kinds of people!"
	Dan William doesn’t stop his action, and he beats them heavier than before.
	" Dan, please look at Jamie Moore. She hurts so badly, and we should send her to hospital first. We will deal this people for you.” Duke Field knows the reason Dan William gets angry is for Jamie Moore. Thus only Jamie Moore could relieve Dan William’s anger.
	Dan William stops finally. His face is very cold. He stares at two men for a few seconds, and then he turns around. He holds Jamie Moore in his arm gently, and now he looks very different.
	"Don’t kill them, and I want to know something from them.” Dan William says in a low voice, and then he strides away.
	That two people are dying.
	Seeing this, Bruce Hill and Duke Field don’t want to beat them by themselves, thus they ask heeler to beat them.
	The two people are also regretful. They wish this is a dream. If they know that the woman is Dan William’s woman, who would dare to touch her?
	-
	In the manor, after checking for Jamie Moore, Dr. Slater gives her a brooch. And then he walks out to talk with Dan William.
	"The injury of Miss Moore is not very serious, but it does harm to her body. She should have a good rest in these days, and she shouldn’t get angry in these days. What’s more, younger master should pay attention to her mental state.” Dr. Slater shakes her head lightly. Since this girl comes to the manor, he comes to here frequently.
	How can she be so weak?
	"I see." Dan William’s eye becomes dim. He asks Cindy Swift to send Dr. Slater downstairs, and then he returns to the room.
	Jamie Moore lies on the bed quietly. Her delicate face turns pale, and now she looks like a dead porcelain doll, which is pitiful.
	Ian Moore lies on the edge of the bed. He stares at Jamie Moore with his big eyes. His eyes are full of worries and fierce.
	Dan William doesn’t speak anything. He sits beside Ian Moore, and he looks at the sleeping face of Jamie Moore. He can’t image what will happen if he comes later. Maybe he will lose Jamie Moore again. He has been waiting for her for five years.
	He won't let that man go! Never!!
	"Daddy, who kidnaps Mommy?" Although Ian Moore's voice is soft and waxy in usual times, now his voice is full of coldness.
	Dan William knows that his son is not an ordinary person long time ago, but he feels sad when he hears the fierce voice of Ian Moore.
	"Don't worry, daddy will handle all of this." He raises his hand and rubs Jamie Moore's hair, and then he promises.
	"Handle?" Ian Moore turns to look at Dan William without any expression. "What should daddy handle most is the woman who lives here. Am I right?"
	“You put a woman at your home, what would mommy think of this?”
	Ian Moore doesn’t know that Jozo has saved the life of Dan William. In his eyes, this woman is the No.1 enemy of Mommy. What’s more, when this woman lives in the house for the first day, she wants to drive him away. But she pretends that she is kind woman in front of his Daddy.
Chapter 248 The man behind the scenes
	"I have thought about this, but the reason that she becomes so is for saving me. When she gets better, I'll arrange her to leave here immediately." Jozo has saved his life, thus it's impossible for Dan William to drive her away so coldly and mercilessly.
	When she gets better, he will send her back to her own house. Dan William has promised this with Jozo at the beginning. Otherwise, he will never let her live in his house.
	Although he doubts Jozo, the paralyzed legs of her are true. What could she do? Dan William has investigated her. Usually Jozo stays at home, and she knows a few people in the Country C. How could she kidnap Jamie Moore? Dan William has no idea.
	Ian Moore keeps silent. He thinks this woman is special to Daddy, but the fact is that she has saved the life of Daddy.
	Ian Moore signs. Anyway, Jozo has a lot of advantages. His mother meets a strong enemy this time.
	But they don’t know that Jozo is at the door. Hearing the dialogue of them, Jozo, who sits on the chair, turns around, and the smiles on her face disappears.
	"Young master, those people have confessed the one behind the scenes." Derek William walks to Dan William, and then he says respectfully.
	The sight of Dan William and Ian Moore become bright suddenly. Then they turn around to look at Derek William. The scene is very funny.
	“Who is that man?”
	Derek William says the name without hesitation.
	-
	In the main house of the William Family, Amelia, who hasn't appeared in the manor for a long time, is holding a small shovel to loosen the soil for the flowers in the garden. She hums a song. The sunshine falls on her body, thus she looks very bright, young and beautiful.
	"Ah, yes!" She suddenly reminds of something, and then she takes out her cell phone and makes a phone call.
	When the phone is answered, Amelia says immediately, “Have you done the thing well? What’s the matter with her?
	The other side of the phone is very quiet. And she can’t hear any voice.
	"Hello?" Amelia frowns slightly, and she urges with dissatisfaction, "Do you still want money? What’s the matter with her?"
	How could he ignore her words?
	"What do you want to do?" A familiar voice comes from behind.
	Amelia shivers. She tries all her efforts to calm herself down, and then she turns around.
	Then she sees Dan William standing behind her, and he looks at her coldly.
	"Brother, brother, don't you have to go to work today? Why do you come here?" She forces herself to look at Dan William calmly, and then she takes a few steps backward.
	The face of Dan William is very cold, and then he walks toward Amelia. He holds a phone in his hand, and then he puts the phone in front of Amelia, “Just now, it's your call."
	His voice is very cold. Other people will be afraid when they hear the voice of him.
	Amelia's palms begin to sweat, and even her forehead begins to sweat.
	She's afraid. She's really afraid. Although this man is her brother, he never treats her in such a cold manner. Even though she always makes troubles with Jamie Moore in the past, he just scolds her with a few words, and he never treats her like today...
	Thus she is very afraid,
	Is this man really her brother?
	"I, I just want to make a joke with her. Don't be angry." Amelia says sweetly. She thinks if she begins to be cute, he will forgive her.
	But this time is different.
	"Make a joke?" Dan William’s eyes are very cold, and he presses his lips hardly. He walks forward suddenly, and then he grabs Amelia’s neck, and his eyes are very cold as if his eyes are full of ice dregs.
	"You almost kill her with such a light joke, don’t you know?"
	His words stab into his heart like a sharp knife. She could feel the restraint and patience of the hand on her neck. Although he is angry, he doesn’t want to kill her.
	But even so, Amelia is still hurt by this.
	Who is she? She is the daughter of the William Family. She has been an apple in the eyes of other people since childhood, and one has never yelled at her so loudly. Now she even feels her life is threatened.
	Amelia is regret. She regrets that she just lets those people kidnap Jamie Moore. She should ask them to kill Jamie Moore.
	Thinking of this, Amelia's beautiful eyes are full of mist. She looks at Dan William in an unbelievable way. She stares at him, and then she shouts sharply, “I just hate her, I want to kill her! Why do you think she is a good woman? Why do you always help her? Brother, I am your sister!"
	It's all because of her.
	Dan William narrows his eyes when he finds the strong hatred on Amelia’s eyes.
	Amelia shouldn't hate Jamie Moore so much. There must be something wrong.
	He loosens his hand, and he wants to know all the things.
	And he also did what he wants to do.
	"I don't know why you hate Jamie Moore so much, but as the daughter of the William Family, you should have your generousness. She will be your sister-in-law in the future. Even though you don’t like her, I won't allow you to hurt her again, otherwise..." Dan William narrows his eyes, and then he stares at Amelia in a warning way.
	Amelia suppresses the fear in the bottom of his heart. Then she nods unwillingly.
	She has never done anything wilder to Jamie Moore, but why does Jamie Moore almost lose her life?
	Amelia bends over and picks up the mobile phone on the ground after Dan William leaves. She opens the phone to find the phone number of Jozo anxiously, and then she gives a phone to Jozo.
	The phone is answered a few seconds later. Then Jozo’s sweet voice comes from the phone, “Amelia.”
	"You told me that those people just tie Jamie Moore up, and they will do nothing bad to her, am I right?” Amelia quests Jozo immediately. She is very angry now. It’s Jozo who ask her to do this. If she doesn’t vent her anger to Jozo, what could she do?
	Jozo keeps silent for a while, and then she says slowly, “I don't know what happened. Don’t they just tie Jamie Moore up?”
	"My brother comes to me just now. You can't take advantage of me to make trouble with Jamie Moore in the future." The attitude of Amelia is very bad. It’s true that she is very angry.
	Although she hates Jamie Moore, she is not stupid. Jozo takes advantage of her to make troubles with Jamie Moore. She even is scolded by her brother, and her brother almost kills her.
	"Amelia, what did you say? You told me that you hate Jamie Moore, thus I give you some advice. Am I right? Don't worry; I won't let you be scolded in vain." Jozo says slowly and obsequiously.
Chapter 249 Ian Moore does all the housework
	Amelia's anger calms down a little. And then she hangs up without saying anything.
	Hum. Does she need the help from her? She will do this by herself!
	Jozo sneers after hanging up. You are so stupid. Do you want to fight with me?
	She doesn’t understand. Dan William has such a high intelligence and ability. How can he have such a stupid sister?
	At this time, Alma walks toward Jozo from the end of corridor quietly.
	“Miss Jozo.” Alma greets Jozo, and then she leaves.
	Because Jozo is resting in the manor these days, Dan William doesn’t ask her to follow Jozo for the time being.
	Jozo despises when she sees the indifferent face of Jozo. She is just a servant. She has such a low identity.
	...
	Jamie Moore has already wakened up, but her face is still pale. Her lips are dry and pale. She blinks her eyes for several times, and then she turns to look at Ian Moore who is sleeping beside the bed.
	When Ian Moore falls asleep, he is just like a little angel. His face is soft. It’s so tender that one even could squeeze out a handful of water from his face. It’s probably because the food in the manor is full of nutrition. His face is a little round, but he still looks cool and handsome.
	His eyelashes are long, and even Jamie Moore is jealous about this. The eyelashes of Ian Moore are as the same as Dan William’s, which are long and curly.
	Jamie Moore pokes the upper side of Ian Moore’s eyes. There is a little bit of cyan there, and it seems that she doesn’t sleep well.
	They worry about her again.
	Fierce flashes through Jamie Moore’s eyes. She thinks she is low-key, and she never fights something with other, and she seldom quarrels with others. She just lives in her own world, and she wants to have her career in her own world.
	Does she enjoy relaxing for a long time? Thus those people could so such a bad thing to her.
	Jamie Moore, Jamie Moore. Do you really want to be so powerless all the time? If those people do such a bad thing again, what should you do? What if their goal is not you?
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes sharply. She looks at the peaceful sleeping face of Ian Moore, and then she frowns tightly.
	Yes, Country C is no better than Britain. She has to worry about her life every day in Britain. But here, she lives under the wings of Dan William; she starts to feel lucky about this.
	Jamie Moore, how could you lose your alertness? Have you forgotten your mission and your hatred? How can you be greedy for enjoyment?
	Jamie Moore closes her eyes hardly, and then she shivers. Then Ian Moore wakes up.
	His eyes are full of surprise, “Mommy, you wake up!” Ian Moore wants to jump into Jamie Moore’s arms. But then he reminds of the injury of Jamie Moore’s chest, thus he stops.
	"Well, why don't you go back to your room?" Jamie Moore rubs his little head, and then she looks at him worriedly.
	Then she decides secretly in her heart. She can’t be so comfortable in the future. She should fight for Ian Moore and Dan William!
	Ian Moore doesn’t know the decision in Jamie Moore’s heart. Then he looks at Jamie Moore with a smart smile. His eyes are bright, “Mommy, are you hungry? I have cooked porridge for you. Do you want to drink some porridge?"
	"Of course." Jamie Moore smiles, and then she looks around. "Where is your daddy? Why don’t I see him?”
	"Daddy's out. He'll be back soon." Ian Moore signs when he thinks what Dan William is going to do.
	Who knows the man behind the scene is Amelia. Daddy must be very tangled in his heart. One side is his lover and son, and the other side is his sister. No one will feel better when he is trapped in the middle.
	Ian Moore leaves the room, and then he goes to the chicken.
	Night.1 brings a stool to Ian Moore, thus Ian Moore could step on it to serve porridge.
	"Ian, do you doubt something?" Seeing Ian Moore serves porridge with a bad face, Night.7 wants to know the thoughts of Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore nods, and then he turns off the fire of the stove. He replies as he serves porridge, “Yes, I always think it's strange."
	Night.7 listens to the words of Ian Moore in the dark quietly.
	"Amelia has led a life of luxury and privilege since childhood. What’s more, she is a little stupid. It’s impossible for her to do such a bad thing to Mommy. Besides, she hasn't appeared in front of us these days, and my mother hasn't offended her. It's hard to imagine that she would have done such thing if no one had persuaded her." Ian Moore lowers his head, and then he thinks all the people in his mind.
	He negates the intelligence of Amelia directly.
	Night.1 is a little surprised. If Ian Moore doesn’t say all of these, she really does not think of this. Amelia is a daughter of an eminent family, and she even dares not to kill a fish. It’s impossible for her to do such a bad thing that may damage other people’s reputation.
	But...
	"But the thinking of a woman is always deep. If she is jealous of your mommy, isn't it reasonable for her to do such a thing?" Night.7 looks at Ian Moore, and then she says quietly.
	Look at this. After Amelia did such a thing to Jamie Moore, Ian Moore calls her Amelia, instead of calling her Auntie. This is the difference.
	But Ian Moore shakes his head lightly, and he doesn’t care about this question, “Even though she hates my mommy, she can’t do such a bad thing to destroy my mommy’s reputation.”
	"Why are you so confident? Don’t you know what happened to her and your mother five years ago?"
	"What’s the matter?" Ian Moore puts a cup of porridge on the tray, and then he puts a few dishes on it, and then he looks at Night.7.
	Night.7 wants to say something to Ian Moore, and then she hears the sound of changing shoes at the door. She blinks at Ian Moore, and then she hides herself in the dark.
	Ian Moore walks out with a tray on his hand. Then he sees Dan William, who has changed the shoes well and is about to go upstairs.
	"Daddy." Ian Moore is very strong. He is not tired when he is holding such a heavy tray.
	He runs toward Dan William. Dan William turns around when Ian Moore walks to the stairway. He walks a few steps down, and then he squats down to look at the tray on Ian Moore’s hand. The dishes on it are simple but delicate, “Is this cooked by you?”
	"Yes." Ian Moore nods with a big smile.
	Dan William is a little surprised. His son is still young. Does Jamie Moore ask him to do this?
	"When did you learn to cook?" Dan William stands up, and then he takes the tray on Ian Moore’s hand, and then he leads him up the stairs.
	Ian Moore thinks for a while, "I don't remember. In the past, Mommy did all the housework and was tired, thus I came to help her. Then...”
	Then Ian Moore did all the housework.
	But Ian Moore feels very happy. When he lives in England, he doesn’t have father. But mommy gives all the love to him. Mommy tries all her effort to make up for the lack of warmth in his heart, so he becomes thoughtful so early.
	"The cooking skill of Mommy is also great." Ian Moore stresses. At the beginning, mommy is a foodie and lazy, and mommy often eats bread instead of rice, thus he learns how to cook.
	Dan William feels pain in his heart. He lowers his head to looks at the clean and silky head of Ian Moore. Then he says, “Daddy will always stay with you. All the bad things have gone."
Chapter 250 Daddy, I have faith in you
	Ian Moore doesn’t replies, and he just smiles. He always believes his daddy, and he also relies on the love from his father.
	When Dan William and Ian Moore walk into the room, Jamie Moore is scratching the scars on her arm. The scars have already started to scab, so it will itch. Thus Jamie Moore can’t help but scratch the scars.
	"Stop. You'll leave scars." Dan William frowns, and then he puts the tray to one side. He grabs Jamie Moore’s hand. There is blood on her arms again. If she continues to scratch the scars, it must leave scars on her arms.
	"Itchy, itchy..." Jamie Moore presses his lips, but she is caught by Dan William, thus she can’t scratch her arms again.
	"Mommy, I will blow it for you, and you won't feel itchy later." Ian Moore sits beside the bed. He holds Jamie Moore’s hand with his small hand, and then he takes a big breath, and then blows it on Jamie Moore’s wound. He looks very cute.
	"Baby..." Jamie Moore looks at him feelingly, "Even if you blow it, I still feel itchy..."
	Ian Moore’s face becomes dark suddenly. He looks at Jamie Moore angrily, “Hum, I don’t want to talk with Mommy again!”
	Then he turns around and leaves. He even gives a sight to Dan William when he leaves. It seems that he is saying - Come on, Daddy, I have faith in you!
	Then he staggers out of the room, and he even closes the door.
	"Cute boy, why do you have such a bad temper?" Jamie Moore is very happy. She looks at the closed door, and she wants to scratch the wound again.
	"Don’t you want to wear beautiful clothes in the future?” Dan William takes out the ointment. He pulls the injured hand of Jamie Moore, and puts it on his thigh, and then he squeezes some ointment and puts it on the wound
	Can't she wear beautiful clothes? Jamie Moore shivers and then she stops her action.
	All women want to become beautiful.
	She feels the cold ointment on her wound, and she doesn’t feel itchy anymore. Thus Jamie Moore calms down gradually.
	She looks at the man who is helping her apply medicine, and she blinks.
	From the anger of Jamie Moore, she can see the strong chest from the collar of his white shirt. It’s very attractive, thus she swallows saliva.
	Dan William looks up after applying medicine for her. Then he finds Jamie Moore is swallowing saliva, and she stares at his collar directly.
	He lowers his head to look at his collar. Does she...
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he throws the medicine on the table. He looks at Jamie Moore, and then he says in a good mood, “You look at me as if you want to pounce on me, why?”
	Pounce on him?
	Jamie Moore is embarrassed. Then she thinks that she drank too much in the hotel that day. She even said she wants to pounce on him. But at last...he pounced on her.
	Thinking of here, Jamie Moore’s face becomes red. Then she hammers his chest with coquetry, "Who, who wants to pounce on you? You are so shameless!"
	"Oh?" Dan William raises his eyebrow, and then she answers in a meaningful way. "Who wants to pounce on me that day?"
	“...” Jamie Moore doesn’t expect that he would say things related to that day. She reminds the scenes on that day, and then she bites her lips.
	"Why do you keep silent?" He approaches her with a thoughtful smile.
	"Don't be so close to me..." Jamie Moore takes a few steps backward subconsciously. She leans against the wall, and she opens her eyes widely. She is very nervous now.
	"I want to stay close with you. What's the matter?" Dan William’s voice is deep and charming.
	Jamie Moore lowers down her eyes, and her face is a little red. She pouts her pale lips, and she looks very shy now.
	Dan William laughs, and then he lowers down his body. Then he kisses Jamie Moore sweetly.
	Jamie Moore wants to refuse the kiss from Dan William. But then she reminds that she has showed her love to Dan William. They love each other. If she still refuses this, is she so shy?
	The kissing skill of Dan William is very well. Jamie Moore loses her sense within a few minutes. Her body becomes soft as if she is a cat. She nestles on his chest quietly.
	If there is no injuries on her body, Dan William would make love with her immediately. Fortunately, he stops in time.
	"Ha-ha..." Jamie Moore covers her mouth, and then she looks at the cold face of Dan William. It’s so great to see Dan William in such a way.
	"I have endured for such a long time! If this happens again, you will bear the consequences.” Then he walks to the bathroom after finishing his words.
	The smile on Jamie Moore’s face become stiff, and then her face become red.
	When Dan William walks out of the bathroom, he sees the cunning smile on her face. Then he suddenly reminds what she is laughing at.
	He walks toward Jamie Moore, and then he hugs her in his arm.
	"Why do you hug me?" Jamie Moore lies in his arms. His arms are dry and warm, and his arm is full of mint fragrance. She feels very warm. Hearing the powerful heartbeat from his chest, he feels very peaceful.
	"What do you want to do? Do you want to sleep with me?" Dan William closes his eyes, and then he puts his chin against her head. There are dark circles under his eyes. It seems that he doesn’t sleep well.
	"You let me go..." Jamie Moore struggles for a few times. Dan William hugs her tightly, thus it’s hard for Jamie Moore to breathe.
	Dan William doesn’t open his eyes. He just lets go of his arms. He says lightly, "If I let you go, I will never hug you again."
	Jamie Moore stops her action suddenly. Then she rushes to his arms a few minutes later. She holds Dan William hardly. Jamie Moore puts her face on Dan William’s chest, enjoying his warmth.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t get angry when she hears the laugh of Dan William. Instead, she pinches his waist and says, "You can’t laugh at me."
	Dan William stops laughing, but the smile on his face doesn’t disappear. He holds Jamie Moore in his arms, and then falls asleep.
	It’s very peaceful in the room.
	-
	The injury can only be cured after having a rest for a week. She stays at the manor all the time. As for Ryan Jack, Jamie Moore lets Ian Moore to see him occasionally. Nothing bad has happened.
	Dan William asks an authoritative doctor from abroad to take charge of the illness of Ryan Jack. He will recover without any sequela soon or later. This also gives Jamie Moore a little comfort, and she doesn’t feel so guilty.
	Jamie More is also surprised when she hears the comprehensive idea of Dan William from Ian Moore. Because it seems that Dan William doesn’t like Ryan Jack. Why does he still ask a doctor for him?
	Is it because of her?
	Jamie Moore feels sweet in her heart. Then she wrinkles her eyes, and then she wears a bright smile on her face.
	Although this man is jealous of Ryan Jack, he still helps her secretly. Although this is far from what Ryan Jack did for her, he has already used his own way to compensate Ryan Jack for her.
	This means that he has taken her as his woman.
	The phone rings suddenly. Jamie Moore looks aside, and then she picks up the phone on the table. Then she answers the phone, “Hello?”
Chapter 251 It's not president Ryan
	"Miss Jamie." Secretary Sam's voice comes from the other side of the phone.
	"Secretary Sam, what can I do for you? Is it about the promo?" Jamie Moore asks politely.
	"Yes, Miss Moore. The president has solved all of the public opinions, and then he has invested a part of money in the promotional film. The filming will start normally at that time. I just inform this to you in advance.” The steady and capable voice comes from the phone, and her voice also shows her personality.
	Jamie Moore is a little surprised, “But isn't Ryan Jack the hero of the propaganda film? He's in hospital now."
	Although Ryan Jack is much better, he can’t leave hospital so quickly. Even though he can leave hospital, he can’t do exercise violently. The script and scenes of the propaganda film are very dangerous, and it’s a hard work.
	"It's not president Ryan, and it's someone else."
	"Who is he?" Jamie Moore is curious. The hero has been changed. What’s more, the filming must be finished before the end of this month. It has been delayed for a long time.
	Now Ryan Jack still needs to have a rest. So it’s reasonable that they change another man to film.
	It impossible to let Ryan Jack, who is still a patient, shot for the promotional film. This is impossible.
	Secretary Sam doesn’t answer, and she just smiles mysteriously, and says, "Miss Moore, you will know everything when you are recovered. The president will tell you the details."
	Jamie Moore is a little embarrassed. Does Secretary Sam know that she has stayed with Dan William?
	-
	Jamie Moore recovers soon, and the wound of the arm and legs doesn’t leave scars. In a word, the medicine given by Dr. Slater's is so good.
	Today, she dresses in black and white. She looks very refined. She wears a white vest, a short black thin coat, and a pair of black leather tights. She wears a belt, which is of the same color with her clothes, around her waist. What’s more, she wears a pair of black thin shoes. She puts her hands in her pockets, and she looks very fashionable.
	She wears a black hat without any decoration on her head. She looks different from usual. Now she looks beautiful and fashionable.
	She wears such fashionable clothes, and she doesn’t look like a woman who already has a child. Instead, she looks like a high school student, and she is full of vitality.
	What’s more, her face is pinky and one could know that she has fallen in love with someone from her face. Thus she looks very attractive.
	Jamie Moore walks from the front door of the Crystal Museum to the inside, and she attracts many people’s eyes during this time. She is so attractive now.
	It's said that the script has been changed. Because the leading actor is different, we have to start filming from the beginning.
	The place for filming at this time is near the Crystal Pavilion, where there is a luxurious white villa in Gothic style. Many TV plays and films are shot there.
	It’s true that they should have chosen this kind of place at the beginning. Why do they go to the rooftop to film? She almost loses her life there.
	Jamie Moore scolds in her heart. She scolds the man who writes the script in her heart fiercely. She opens the carved door, and then she walks into the room.
	"Jamie Moore, here you are. Everything will be OK soon. You shall go to the lounge and have a rest first. The leading actor is also in the lounge. Seeing Jamie Moore walking into the room, the director is in a good mood. Jamie Moore doesn’t know the reason. The director usually wears a cold expression on his face.
	The director looks at Jamie Moore with admiration.
	Jamie Moore nods politely, “OK, director, I'll go to have a look."
	She is always curious about this mysterious hero. Secretary Sam refuses to tell her in order to maintain the sense of mystery. Thus Jamie Moore is more curious about this man. Now she could see this man, thus she is very excited.
	She walks to the corridor on the second floor slowly. There is the rest room. She knocks on the door without any hesitation, and then she walks into the room.
	In the golden section villa area of the Country A
	The villa of the Charlies Family is located in the best position of villa group.
	The Charlies Family is also one of the top families in country C. Dean Charlies is the leader of the Charlies Family. Although he has retired, everyone should show enough respect to him in the Country C. The Charlies Family has a close relationship with the Ministry of National Defense.
	The wife of Dean Charlies also has a strong family background. She was born in a noble family. They love each other after getting married. They almost stay with each other all day. In order to stay alone with each other only, they give the company to their children, and they go to travel.
	It's said that the eldest son of the Charlies Family is very cold, but he is very kind. What’s more, he leads a self-discipline life. He has been a low-key person all these years. He has never had any sex with any woman. Besides, he seldom appears in front of the media, and he seldom appears in business parties.
	But everyone knows the existence of this man.
	But now the eldest son of the Charlies Family, who always keeps low-key in the circle, is cooking in the kitchen. If those media see it, they will be shocked.
	Wendy rubs her eyes, and then walks out of the room on the second floor without wearing shoes. She looks at the busy back in the open kitchen, and then she asks with a smile, “What do we eat today, Eddie?"
	Dan William, Bruce Hill and Duke Field all know Eddie Charlies. Thus Jamie Moore also knows Eddie Charlies. Since Jamie Moore knows Eddie Charlies, it means Wendy also knows Eddie Charlies. What’s more, the relationship between them is good.
	Although Eddie Charlies is a rich young man, he treats Wendy very well. What’s more, the Charlies Family and the Wendy Family knew each other well long time ago. More importantly -
	If Wendy doesn’t find the man she loved in the age of 23, The Wendy Family will let her marry another man.
	And that man is the eldest son of the Charlies Family - Eddie Charlies.
	But it doesn’t affect the relationships between Wendy and Eddie Charlies. They are childhood sweethearts. Eddie will help Wendy when Wendy did something bad in childhood.
	Wendy knows Eddie Charlies well. If she is not willing to marry him, Eddie Charlies will never force her to do this.
	She never expects that she would meet Eddie Charlies in such a low-spirited and embarrassed period of her life.
	What’s more, she never expects that there is no sense of strangeness between them. They get along with each other happily as usual.
	Wendy knows Jamie Moore has secret. Joey Lan also has secret, and Duke Field also has secret. And Eddie Charlies, who disappeared before, also has a secret.
	She doesn’t want to ask Eddie, and she dares not to ask. Because she knows that everyone has their own secret. If such secret is painful, no one is unwilling to say it out.
	It's as painful as letting her give up Duke Field.
	"Won't you come down to see what I cooked by yourself?" The careless and clear voice of Eddie Charlies comes from downstairs. He is taking out the dishes from the pan. He takes them out and looks at Wendy. His eyes are full of smile.
	"Have you brushed your teeth and washed your face? You should be the sloppiest girl!" Eddie Charlies looks at her in disgust, and then he shakes his head.
	Hearing this, Wendy hums and then she returns back to the room to wash her face.
	When he finishes washing and goes downstairs to have lunch, Eddie Charlies has already placed the dishes and chopsticks on the table.
Chapter 252 What goes around comes around
	Wendy curls her legs. She picks the bowl in front of her, and she wants to have a try. But she couldn’t stop after taking a bite. She is amazed. If she hasn't eaten the rice made by Eddie Charlies, she couldn't believe that this rich man knows how to cook.
	The saying “what goes around comes around” is absolutely true. The pendulum has swung back. In the past, she would laugh if someone tells her that the eldest son of the Charlies Family cooks well. She would think it's just a rumor!
	But now...
	"If you fear that I have put poison in the food, you can stop eating.” Eddie Charlies frowns, and he stares at Wendy. He pulls the dish to himself, and then says coldly.
	"No, no. You have cooked the delicious food for me. Even though you put poison in the food, I will eat it!” Wendy stops Eddie quickly. Then she pulls the food to her side, and then she eats happily.
	Seeing Wendy eats so happily, Eddie Charlies smiles, and then he begins to eat.
	He looks at Wendy as she eats. Five years has passed. She hasn’t change at all. Although she is quieter than before, and has something on her mind, she is still as the same as before.
	Eddie Charlies knows that it’s for Duke Field that she becomes that way in the bar.
	"Duke Field bullies you so much. Do you need my help?" Eddie Charles asks tentatively.
	She shakes her head, “He doesn’t bully me. It’s my problem.”
	"Do you still love him?" Eddie Charlies stops his action. He looks at Wendy nervously, as if he is determining something.
	"It's not so easy for a woman to forget the man she loved.” Wendy answers honestly, “But I've decided to give him up."
	Although Duke Field is very good, they will never become lovers. Thus she should give him up.
	"Is Duke Field so good that you only love him?"
	Wendy is in a trance for the words of Eddie Charles. Is Duke Field so good?
	Jamie Moore also asks her such a question.
	The answer she gives is that Duke Field gave her a touch of warmth in her most helpless time. How could she not love him?
	So she loves him during her whole youth.
	She is not Jamie Moore. She is not as lucky as Jamie Moore. No matter how many years passed, Dan still waits for Jamie and never gives up. Although Dan William is indifferent to Jamie Moore, he really loves her.
	And she is different. The people she loves do not love her at all. What’s more, the man she loves is into the other woman.
	Wendy's eyes are full of tears. She rubs her hairs. Her eyes are empty. She looks at the porcelain bowl in front of her.
	Seeing Wendy is sad, Eddie Charlies also feels sad. It seems that his heart has been grabbed by a big hand.
	He once thought Wendy and Duke Field will have a good result if he disappears. But now they don’t have a good result. Instead, Wendy feels sad now.
	He knows Wendy is a woman who will try all her effort to help her friend. But it’s him who saves her finally. Why does she love Duke Field?
	Why is God so fond of teasing people?
	She says that she loves Duke Field for the first sight. But he also loves Wendy for such a long time. She gives all her youth to Duke Field, and he also tries all she can to make her smile.
	When he stays at the hospital alone, she devotes all her efforts to Duke Field. She loves that man so much.
	Perhaps, his secret is no longer important.
	"Let’s eat now. I'll take you back after eating." Eddie Charlies says lightly. Then he continues to eat as if nothing has happened.
	"Well." Wendy smiles at him, and then she eats happily. She could only eat such a meal for one time. It will be hard to eat such delicious food again in the future.
	Eddie Charlies’s eyes are complicated. He holds the chopsticks tightly.
	Did he do something wrong...
	-
	Jamie Moore is shocked. She puts her hand on the door lock. She opens her mouth, and looks at the man sitting on the sofa in the lounge.
	The man sitting on the sofa wears neat suit. When he hears the sound of opening the door, he does not turn around. Thus Jamie Moore could only see his side face.
	But even though she just sees his side face, Jamie Moore knows who this man is instantly.
	Dan William!
	Is Dan William the hero of the filming?
	Seeing that Jamie Moore doesn’t do anything, Dan William turns around to look at her. Jamie Moore has beautiful eyes and eyebrows, which is quite unrealistic.
	"What are you doing? Come in!" He beckons to Jamie Moore in a casual and lazy manner, but he still looks like a noble man.
	Jamie Moore walks toward him unconsciously. She still wears a shock expression on her face. It’s obvious that she is surprised.
	When she touched the hand of Dan William, Dan William pulls her into his arms.
	Jamie Moore finally gets her sense. She looks at the handsome face in front of her, “Hello, are you my partner?”
	Dan William raises his eyebrow. He hugs Jamie Moore into his arms, “Do you want to cooperate with other man?”
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She thinks this man is too jealous. But he could film with her, and that feeling is very good.
	"Do you think I am so attractive that other man will be attracted by me?" Jamie Moore touches Dan William’s hand with her face like a cat.
	The fact is that the man in front she is really attractive, right? There are so many women around him. What’s more, a woman even life in his house. And this woman even wants to make trouble with her!
	It should be her who doesn't trust him.
	"Hum." Dan William snorts. He looks at the dress Jamie Moore wears with appreciation. Jamie Moore really has a good taste. The dress makes her look very young, and the dress suits her well.
	"But do you know how to act?" Jamie Moore reminds of something, and then she looks at Dan William. Her eyes become bright. She knows that Dan William is very powerful since childhood. He learns what he wants to learn well. He can do everything. But as for acting, he can’t do this, is she right?
	There are few actors’ lines in the promotion film and he should express through his sight. But the sight of Dan William could let people shut up and even kill other people. Does he know what an affectionate gaze is?
	Jamie Moore finally finds out the thing that Dan William can’t do, thus she is a little happy.
	Dan William doesn’t get angry. He overlaps his legs, and he holds Jamie Moore’s waist with on one hand, and picks the script with the other hand.
	"There should be no difficulty." He glances at it roughly, and there is nothing special.
	But why does he feel that this girl is eager to see the embarrassment of him?
	"Don't look down on this thing. If we don't work well, we'll both lose face!" Jamie Moore lies on Dan William’s arms, and she looks at the script. Sure enough, the script has almost totally been changed because of the re-filming. But as for this script, she feels much confident.
Chapter 253 Planning
	At this time, there are no dangers in the filming. But the plot setting is very romantic, and it’s just like a TV series.
	"Who writes the script? All people in the Star like dangerous actions, don’t they?" Jamie Moore turns over a few pages, and then she thinks the writer of this script is very great. Compared with those crazy writers in Star, this writer is so wonderful.
	In order to attract people's attention, the filming before almost kills her. Regardless of reputation or interests, it’s a heavy blow to the Star.
	But it's their own fault, so they should bear the consequence of this.
	And the re-filming of the promotional film is very important to the Star. It can be said that this is a turning point for the company. It will determine whether Star can make profits again.
	She also knows Dan William doesn’t like appearing in front of the media. She has looked for his information in the search engine before. All photos are about his side face and back. All of these show that he doesn't like taking photos.
	The reason that she decides to continue filming is for Ryan Jack. She owes him too much. But now his company has difficulties. Even though she can't do anything, she could continue to shoot for the promotional film.
	But she never expects that Dan William would accompany her.
	In her impression, he is really busy at work. Sometimes when she wakes up in the midnight and goes downstairs to drink water, she finds that the light in the study is still on. Sometimes he coaxes her to sleep first, and then he gets up to have a video conference. When she wakes up, he will always be with her for the first time. It's her own debt clearly, but now he helps her to pay it.
	Is this man going to spoil her? And then she will take it for granted in the future.
	"The writer of this script is Kiera Jeff. The plan of the Star is so inferior.” Dan William blinks, and then he snorts at the Star.
	He has found out that the High-altitude Falling Accident of last filming is caused by the staff of Star. But he doesn’t find out the man. But obviously, that man must has bad intentions.
	The man who writes that plan also has bad intentions.
	As all the filming is based on that plan, it must be done intentionally.
	When Dan William continues to search for this clue, then he finds some useful information.
	Hooson
	Kiera Jeff?
	Jamie Moore knows Kiera Jeff. This playwright is arrogant and stubborn, but there are countless people who want to get a script from him. Every script he written is very popular with no exception.
	It’s said that Kiera Jeff is arrogant and stubborn. How could Dan William get the script from him?
	"If the script is written by Kiera Jeff, this propaganda film must be very popular!” Jamie Moore’s eyes become bright, and her eyes are full of exultant light. She doesn’t expect that Kiera Jeff, who is a famous man, would write a script for a promotional film. It's really rare.
	"Shouldn't you show your thank to me?" Dan William takes the script away from her hand, and then throws it aside at will. He doesn’t care that this script is written by Kiera Jeff.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore looks up at him, and then she blinks her eyes doubtfully.
	Dan William reaches out his index finger and points at his lips. He looks very attractive.
	Jamie Moore’s face becomes red. She looks at the rosy thin lips of Dan William. She could not help swallowing her saliva.
	Emma, she is too reserved by looking forward to his kiss in such a way, isn’t she?
	Jamie Moore hesitates for a while, and then she kisses Dan William suddenly.
	But how can this satisfy Dan William's desire?
	Jamie Moore wants to stop kissing. But Dan William holds her head, and kisses Jamie Moore hardly.
	His kiss is very skillful, and Jamie Moore could not help but respond him. The kissing skill of Jamie Moore is not very good, but this skill has her unique fragrance. And Dan William’s self-control, of which he has been proud, is almost defeated by all of this.
	At this time, someone knocks on the door suddenly. The staff is going to call Jamie Moore and Dan William. The staff standing at the door is shocked when he sees this scene.
	Hearing the sound of the door, Jamie Moore pushes Dan William hurriedly. She dares not to look at the man standing at the door, and she covers her face with her hand.
	It’s too shameful. It’s too shameful! How could she forget they are in this place? How could they...
	It takes a long time to shoot. How can she meet people in the future? It’s too shameful. It’s too shameful!
	Compared with Jamie Moore’s panic and shyness, Dan William is very calm. He holds Jamie Moore in his arm. And he looks at that staff in a threatening way.
	The staff stands in situ suddenly. He doesn’t know whether he should leave or stay there. He looks at him cautiously. "Director, director, director said that the filming is about to start. He asks me to call you...I didn’t see anything..."
	"Well." Dan William answers coldly. The staff leaves immediately as if he has granted an amnesty.
	How can there be a person with such terrible eyes? He glances at him, thus he dares not to walk anymore.
	The staff even closes the door for them when he leaves.
	Jamie Moore lies on the chest of Dan William, and she covers her face with Dan William’s coat. She dares not to move anymore, and her face is very hot. She feels shameful.
	She hasn't been so shameful. She just kisses with the man she loved. How this scene could be seen by other. It's seems that she is a mistress of Dan William!
	It’s too shameful!
	Dan William smiles when he looks at Jamie Moore who looks like an ostrich. Then he pats on Jamie Moore’s little butt, and says, "Why are you so shy? You are so brave when you say you want to make love with me. How could you be so shy now?"
	Jamie Moore hums. She knows that he would laugh at her on this thing all the time. She is a girl. It’s reasonable that she will be shy. She is not like him, who never feels shy.
	"Get up, and do you still want to shoot?" Seeing that Jamie Moore is very shy, Dan William is in a good mood. He holds her face sweetly.
	Jamie Moore looks up, and she stares at Dan William. All of this is because of him. Otherwise, she will not be so shameful!
	"Of course." Miss Moore raises her chin and says proudly.
	Dan William chuckles. Then he lowers down to kiss Jamie Moore lightly. “Let’s go.”
	Jamie Moore covers her mouth, and she stares at him. He kisses her again. Even though he doesn’t want to keep his face, how could he let her lose her face?
	How can she face the staff if he keeps doing this?
	-
	So the filming starts, and Jamie Moore is still nervous.
	There are almost three reasons for this.
	First of all, in order to avoid the emergency of the last time, every staff devotes all their energy to the filming. They dare not to let the emergency happen again. They control every detail to avoid any mistake. Dan William doesn’t trust the safety awareness of these people in Star, thus he directly send people from CR to check the props. He needs to ensure that this place is very safe.
	Second, the script is written by Kiera Jeff, who is very famous in this circle. Even though you have money, you may also fail to buy the works of Kiera Jeff. Thus everyone is serious about this. So she should try all her efforts to make the propaganda film well. Otherwise, she will let down Kiera Jeff as well as these hard-working staffs.
Chapter 254 The beauty is quite dangerous.
	They know that at this time, the play is invested by Dan and they really feel grateful for Dan’s help before. Now they treat him more like a boss.
	The third one is Dan. At this moment, this unique myth in the business is sitting on the lounge chair to wear make ups. His attitude is extremely cold, which makes people dare not to approach him and even the atmosphere in the entire venue has solidified.
	Half of the present staffs are girls, because Moon focuses on series of perfume and they have their own branches in France and other countries. Moon's president, Dan William, rarely appears in front of the public, so he’s a mysterious existence.
	Jamie's forehead twitches and she glances at Dan, who closes his eyes and pretends to sleep. The screams of the girls not far away almost puncture her eardrums.
	The old sayings mention that the beauty is quite dangerous. However the effect of the charm of the man beside her is more exaggerated than the effect of the beauty in the old sayings. Every time he goes somewhere, he must make some troubles.
	Kiera's play is different from the one designed by Moon. Not only its risk factor is of the lowest standard, but the plot setting is also more romantic. More importantly, it gives people a visual impact and makes people enjoy it visually.
	They two cooperate very well that basically all the scenes can be finished by one time.
	As for this scene, Jamie should come out of the pool at the beginning, and then she should swim toward Dan, who is in the middle of the swimming pool. Her swimming posture is perfect because she was trained by Dan before. In the green swimming pool water, she comes and goes like a mermaid.
	She swims to the center to grab Dan's wrist and Dan opens his eyes. His eyes show the confusion and doubts of first meeting without any personal emotion, which causes Jamie to be surprised for a while.
	Seriously? Does he act or does he wake up while he’s asleep?
	Jamie's mouth twitches invisibly, then she grabs Dan's wrist. Then she sinks violently into the water with him.
	The swimming pool here is not very deep. Jamie can hold her breath in the water for about 40 seconds at most. It takes only half a minute in this time.
	Under the water, a mint green perfume bottle is fixed at the bottom of the pool, and the crystal bottle flashes just like a diamond which will shine brightly under the light.
	Jamie narrows her eyes and smiles. She tries to ease the discomfort caused by the water waves, which rush into her eyes, and then she slowly swims towards the bottle of perfume.
	At this time, the perfume bottle is suddenly out of control and is swept away by the water wave. Then it rolls into a vortex, which is bigger and bigger and wraps the perfume bottle.
	Jamie and Dan glances at each other, then they make a sharp turn when they are about to reach the bottom of the pool. They swim along the position of the perfume bottle in the vortex.
	Under the control of the vortex, the perfume bottle rushes out of the water and it flips in the air for several rounds. Finally it falls into the water, and is firmly caught by a hand.
	The venue begins to change. It is originally day time but at this time it turns into night. The perfume bottle held by Dan becomes the only light spot, like the light emitted by the fireflies' tail wings. It really shines brightly in the dark.
	The perfume bottle seems to be filled with perfume. However, when the cap is opened, fireflies pour out.
	They come out one by one. They seem to have a telepathy that they all embellish on the hair and clothes of Jamie and Dan. The lights of them make their delicate and beautiful faces more amazing.
	"What do they do? How will these fireflies fly over us?" The lights around her are dimmed and they can’t see clearly. So she moves her lips and asks.
	"Salt." Dan answers softly, and a warm breath sprays on Jamie's ear, making her feel itchy.
	So they’re deliberately mystifying. Jamie looks at the fireflies that land on her with her mouth pouted. The fireflies are gleaming in a green glow, which look so beautiful.
	"Cut!" The director stops the filming and the shadows around him rise.
	The sudden light makes Jamie narrow her eyes uncomfortably. She can no longer see the fireflies on her body, but she can see that the perfume bottle is filled again.
	"It's great. It’s just a one take. Mr. William, you have a hard work." The director smiles a little flatteringly and quickly he asks people to get a towel and pull Dan and Jamie up.
	Dan props up on the shore then he reaches out to Jamie to pull her up. When he hears the director's words, he just nods.
	"With today's effectiveness, it will be finished in almost a week!" The director's voice is a bit excited, and indeed the filming is delayed for too long.
	Jamie wipes her hair with a towel. When she wipes her hair in half work, a cool palm covers on her small hand. It also helps her wipe her hair with the towel in her head.
	His body seems to be covered with perfume. It smells very light, tangling into her breath.
	"Mr. William, why not go outside to celebrate in the condition that today's work can be finished so early?" Moon's director steps near them and says to Dan.
	Dan glances at him while his hands keep working. His tone is cold, which makes others can’t help but want to remain certain distance with him. "No need. Let's talk about the meal after it is over."
	The director's face looks awkward, and he doesn’t expect Dan would refuse so directly and show so less respect to him.
	The phone rings, and Jamie stoops down to take the phone on the lounge chair to answer it. Before she speaks, there is an anxious voice over there. It is from the special nurse. "Miss Moore, please come and see. Mr. Jack just got a headache and vomited against all medicine. He keeps shouting your name. "
	Ryan?
	Jamie suddenly remembers that because of the need to shoot today, she doesn't have time to visit him in the hospital. What happens? Does the wound recur?
	"How is he going now?" Jamie asks quickly, and her clear eyes show her worries.
	Dan's hand pauses and his eyes turn dark. Then he continues to wipe. Actually, the sound coming from the phone is too clear to be heard by him.
	"The situation is really not good. You should take a look by yourself." After the special nurse says, there is a busy tone over there, and then the phone is hanged up.
	Jamie listens to the busy tone from the phone, and then she turns off the screen. She turns her head to look at Dan, but she addicts into a pair of deep and dark eyes.
	"Have you heard it?" She looks at him with her eyes filled with innocence and she blinks while speaking.
	Dan nods his head and his eyes express a light smile. He rubs her wet hair and his voice remains the cold and sexy style, "I will go with you."
	Jamie thinks that it will fine as long as he allows her to go. But she doesn't expect him to accompany her. She smiles sweetly and looks at him with a smile. If there aren’t so many people here, she will rush to hug him!
	_
	In the hospital
	Although Ryan has recovered a lot and is transferred to the general ward, he still needs to be observed for 24 hours.
	The special nurse takes the money from Ryan and she stands aside with a smile, thinking that the money is several times more than her daily wage. She just gives a phone call and she can get so much money. Anyone will do it in this condition.
Chapter 255 Because she is Jamie.
	As for Ryan, he isn’t as serious as what the special nurse says. He is pretending to sleep with his back against the wall. The bed faces the window and the sun shines through the slightly closed glass window, on his body.
	Special nurse looks at his profile, and she is even addicted in it.
	He is the kind of person who makes you feel warm when you are looking at him. It makes people feel warmer when he smiles.
	Jamie became friends with him because she was struggling with difficulties at that time and she was really longing for the warmness.
	Ryan knows that it is really naive to use his nurse to cheat Jamie in this way. But he wants to see Jamie, so he has to use some special methods.
	There are light footsteps outside the door, and Ryan knows that it is from Jamie. He does not hesitate to cover the quilt and a few drops of cold sweat turn out from his forehead.
	When Jamie opens the door, she sees Ryan curling up in the bed and sweating on his forehead. The guilt in her heart is like a tide that drowns her desperately.
	The guilt, which has been gradually weakened, wholly appears again at this moment and her eyes turn red.
	She walks over and pats Ryan's shoulder gently. She says in a soft voice, "Ryan, are you okay?"
	Ryan raises his head and opens his eyes to look at her. There’s confusion and tolerance in his eyes. He nods gently, "Jamie, are you coming to see me?"
	His eyes place inadvertently at Dan and then he looks at Jamie casually.
	"Can’t I come? How are you going? Do you feel better? Has the wound recurred?" Jamie looks worriedly at the white bandage on his head although it is not bleeding, which means that the wound is not torn.
	Ryan stares at her worried sights and he remains his gentle style, saying, "It's okay. I just feel uncomfortable just now. Are you just at the filming position? Can you come out suddenly?"
	Dan, who is standing behind Jamie, puts his hands around his chest and looks at him coldly. Although he has shown no sign, his deep dark eyes have already announced his ownership.
	Ryan purses his lips. Even though he has already heard from Jamie about it, when he sees that they come together, he still feels a little uncomfortable.
	How can this man let Jamie fall in love with him again after five years?
	"The filming is finished. You don't have to worry." Jamie smiles lightly and she walks to the table aside. She takes out the medicine and takes the appropriate amount. The she pours him a cup of warm water and hands it to him, "Eat the medicine."
	Ryan takes the glass without frowning and obediently takes all the medicine.
	Dan raises his eyebrows and his lips as if he has found something interesting.
	"Ah! I forgot to take my things in the car. Dan, give me the car key. I want to take it." Jamie suddenly remembers that she doesn't take her mobile phone. No wonder she always feels something is forgotten on their way.
	She is a net potato. Her usual hobby is to use her mobile phone to chat online. If the mobile phone is not in her hand, she will be uncomfortable. This is a kind of disease called mobile phone syndrome.
	"Go back quickly." Dan hands her the car key. Jamie takes the car key and walks out of the ward.
	There are only two men left in the ward. Suddenly a strange silence appears.
	The special nurse looks while standing aside, thinking that it’s so great if one of the two handsome men would be her boyfriend...
	"When Jamie was in England, I met her soon after she gave birth to Ian. She is a very strong girl. She stayed alone abroad. Regardless of those comments from the outside world, she gave birth to a baby and raised him up. Life was so hard, but she still had a smile on her face every day. Ryan says, as if he is talking to himself. His memory seems to play a movie and he looks at the white wall.
	The reason why he helped Jamie in England is not all because of how strong she was, nor because of Ian’s innocence, but because she is Jamie.
	Dan raises his eyes lazily, watching Ryan's nostalgic look. He doesn’t care about it.
	She even has a smile that can’t be ignored in winter. It’s a high compliment. Jamie is indeed worthy of this compliment. But if it’s said by Ryan, it will be another matter.
	"I know everything about what Mr. Jack said just now and I know it clearly. So Mr. Jack doesn’t need to bother to remind me." Dan's voice is low, and no other emotion can be found on his face. The color of his lips is a little bit light, it is not like the usual rose color, but it adds a sense of gentle elegance to him.
	Ryan says word by word, "If you don't cherish her well, I will replace you and accompany her. I really warn you."
	Dan's lips are half-raised to show an arc, "You don't have to say it so seriously. You don’t have to use the tears of caiman and pretend to be very concerned about Jamie."
	Ryan feels surprised and his fingers under the quilt can’t help tightening. Looking at Dan's unfathomable expression, he just feels that the man in front of him really confirms the rumor. He is unfathomable, indifferent and proud.
	"What do you mean?"
	"You’re very clear about my meanings. If Mr. Jack can't manage your men, then don't blame me on helping you teach them one day.”
	What Dan refers to is Hooson.
	Because he finds that the high-altitude fall incident heaped last time is related to Hooson. Although the traces behind are erased by others, Dan still finds out that it is Hooson who let people destroy it so that the wire would get loosed and it causes an accident.
	Hooson, a member of Moon, is a subordinate of Ryan.
	There is one thing that is suspicious. Hooson always has a good impression of Jamie, and he has helped Jamie. In addition, he and Jamie have nothings against each other. Even Hooson is an orphan. Why did he intend to kill Jamie?
	Dan doesn't care what Hooson’s purpose. But he doesn't allow this kind of thing to happen again. So he even doubts Ryan.
	Before the murderer is found, everyone may be the murderer.
	Ryan trembles slightly, and soon he returns to normal state. He stares at Dan and nods with a smile, "Mr. William, rest assured. I will handle this matter well."
	Dan doesn't answer and he doesn't even care about his words. He won’t believe in anyone except himself. It relates to Jamie's life and safety. He can’t take any risk.
	He can’t afford to lose Jamie at all.
	"I'm coming." Jamie opens the door and walks in. She feels that the atmosphere in the room is as quiet and frozen as it is when she leaves. There is no active atmosphere at all.
	She puts the apples she bought just now on the table and then she cuts an apple for Ryan.
Chapter 256 Too childish
	"Thank you, Jamie." Ryan squints and smiles. Then he provocatively gives Dan a look, biting the apple complacently.
	Dan doesn't say a word, but quietly looks at Jamie's skillful way of cutting and techniques. It seems that she has practiced it countless times. The movement is quick and accurate. The fruit that she cuts is perfect.
	Jamie knows that Dan likes to eat pears with more juice, so she cuts a pear and gives it to Dan.
	This pleases Dan and he thinks that he defeats Ryan in this aspect.
	Dan sees the pear she delivers to him and smiles, looking provocatively at Ryan.
	Childish! He's really childish!
	If Dan hasn’t asked someone to investigate Ryan, he would doubt that this Ryan is a fake one. It’s just a fruit, how can he be so childish?
	"Why are you two looking at each other?" Jamie turns to look at Dan and then Ryan. She finds that they are staring at each other, as if a fire is burning in their eyes, which surprises her a bit.
	"Nothing. Just a bug comes in my eyes." Ryan says, reaching out his hand and rubbing his eyes.
	Dan pretends not to see anything, and eats the pear very gracefully.
	Jamie and Dan do not stay for a long time. They tell the doctor to take care of Ryan, and they leave the hospital together.
	Jamie is a little absent-minded and doesn't know what she is thinking. She purses tightly. This is her expression when she is upset.
	"What are you thinking?" Dan pats her forehead lightly. His voice is clear and soft. He slows his pace so that she can keep up with him.
	Dan knows it very clearly that Jamie is worried about Ryan's injury and feels guilty. She has always been like this. She doesn't like to owe others. If she can’t pay for others’ favor, she will be upset and will think so much.
	It can be said that this is also a kind of respect for friendship.
	However, if this respect is used by evil people, then it will cause very serious consequences.
	"I’m thinking about when Ryan's injury will heal." Jamie bites her lower lip and places her head against Dan's shoulder.
	When she first arrived, Ryan's sweats on his forehead really scare her. And the scene that he rescued her will always come to her mind and the unavoidable guilt will fill her heart.
	Perhaps it is because Dan has protected her so well from childhood and even this kind of thing didn’t happen in the UK. So once it happens, even if she doesn't say it, she always has an indelible guilt for Ryan.
	"Even if you are worried that he won't get better right away. It's better to let it go." Dan's voice is faint, and his handsome face shows no emotions.
	Jamie wrinkles her small nose, and when she walks to the corner, a figure suddenly bumps into her and she really doesn’t expect it.
	"Be careful." Fortunately, Dan reacts quickly to hug her waist and dodges aside, protecting her in his arms.
	"I'm fine." Jamie looks up and looks subconsciously in the direction of the man.
	The man is wearing a long black trench coat and looks like a woman. But Jamie feels that this is man is really familiar.
	She might have seen him before.
	"Dan, I seem to have seen that person in somewhere." Jamie points to the person who is far away, researching her memory to think about who this person is .
	Dan narrows his eyes for a moment. His hands fall in his trouser pockets, and he says to Jamie, "Who?"
	"I don't know." Jamie blinks a few times and looks at him innocently.
	Dan's lips twitch. Then he looks away and steps away.
	Jamie glances at the man’s back. Then she stares at Dan who has stridden away and she hurriedly chases after him, "Are you proud that you have long legs? Wait for me ..."
	After leaving the hospital, Dan walks to the parking lot to take the car, followed by Jamie, who is trying hard to keep up with him. They two keep at a distance of five steps. Whenever Jamie is going to catch up with him, Dan will speed up. For several rounds, Jamie is so angry that she almost throws the bag in her hand on him.
	Dan's car is black, and Jamie can’t control herself as soon as she sees his car. She shakes her bag and runs forward with all efforts, without ever caring about her image as a fair maiden.
	Then, when there are a few steps away from the car, Jamie jumps violently into the driver's seat of the car.
	Dan's pauses and he’s a bit surprised by Jamie's rude behavior. He looks around and finds that the passer-by, who saw the scene just now, has stopped walking, as if he is petrified.
	He chuckles and then walks over. He opens the door to sit in the passenger seat.
	He can see through the rear-view mirror that Jamie is putting her little feet into the car bit by bit. The movement is very slow, and there is a charm of laziness.
	Dan twitches his lips and starts the engine. The black convertible leaves the parking lot and drives on the road. Then it drives at a speed that is extremely fast.
	"Ah! Dan, can't you drive slower?" Jamie doesn't expect that he would suddenly speed up. Fortunately, she puts her legs into the car in time. Otherwise she will even be thrown out!
	_
	The filming of the promotional video continues.
	Fortunately, Jamie and Dan have a high level of tacit understanding. In addition, Kiera's script is very smooth. With their hard work, it takes only three days to complete the filming.
	The poster of the promotional video has reported. It is a picture of Jamie and Dan leaning back to back and holding a blue enchantress in the hand that is put on the side. The scene is beautiful and simple, and the style is suitable.
	As soon as this poster is reported, it causes a sensation in the entire city of A.
	Nobody is more familiar with the event between Dan and Jamie than these media, for they have witnessed the thing five years ago.
	As a CR designer, Jamie was once nominated. Her works have been displayed in CR's storefronts. She has won a lot of female fans. In the days when Jamie does not go to the company, Secretary Sam receives numerous reservations that invite Jamie to design clothes for them, but they are all denied by Dan.
	This does not affect those people's love for Jamie's design. The rare things are expensive. The ones that are not available are always the best. Her clothing has been constantly priced and its price has surpassed the price of the most expensive suit that she designed when she worked in FS.
	But for Jamie, if she knows that such a good chance to earn money is denied by Dan, she will probably throw his planning book and computer into the swimming pool while he is sleeping at night.
	Three days later, the director of the Moon invites Dan and Jamie to dine in the private dining room on the seventh floor of Star.
	Amelia happens to come to the manor today to find Dan and to play with Ian.
	After Jamie is kidnapped last time, Ian's attitude towards Amelia is somewhat lukewarm, and she will not call her aunt intimately.
	"Bunny, come here to auntie. I bring you a gift." Amelia takes out a limited model toy for Ian and shakes it a few times to let him come over.
	Ian is lying on a big lemon yellow sofa. He glances at the toy in her hand. His voice is soft yet maddening, "I don't play with toys anymore. It's something that only kids can play with. "
Chapter 257 Her son is so sweet
	Amelia chuckles. From the perspective of the price and quantity of toys, she is indeed very good to Ian, but she violates Ian's bottom-line. How can Ian easily forgive her?
	"You are only four or five years old so you are also a kid." Amelia pushes the model toy over, and then she takes out other small yet delicate toys from the gift bag behind.
	Ian doesn’t look at the toys but looks at the game screen on the ipad. He says politely but indifferently, "Thank you, I don’t need it. I don’t like toys very much."
	In fact, Ian used to like toys before. When he and Jamie went shopping and saw the various toys in the big windows of the store, he always had a strong desire.
	But he knew that Jamie didn’t have extra money to buy toys for him. At that time, Jamie was not a king designer of FS. When he was about one year old, something bad happened in France and Chris had to give up the idea of taking them back to France. Although he left a lot of money to them, the money was all rubbed by the hooligans in England.
	The hooligans told them that she should hand over the money or hand Ian over. Jamie was weak so she handed over all the money. But those people still didn't give up and wanted to take Ian away.
	Ian looked cute and delicate so he attracted those people’s evil attention.
	They used toys that Ian had often seen in the window to attract Ian to sneak out of the house. If Jamie didn't find it in time, Ian would never be able to return.
	Also at that time, Ian and Jamie met Ryan.
	Since then, Ian was no longer fond of the toys in the window, nor did he ask Jamie to buy him a toy. Later, after Jamie went to the FS, their living conditions were greatly improved. But Ian doesn’t like to play with toys since then.
	Amelia puts her hand on those toys awkwardly and she takes it back. She finds that Ian's attitude today towards her is very different from before and he even tries to alienate her. He doesn't greet her and even ignores her.
	What did she do to make Ian unhappy?
	Amelia suddenly thinks of someone, Jamie!
	It must be her. Ian probably knows that she kidnaps his mother, so he is so cold to her!
	Damn, Jamie. How dare she tell a child about this kind of thing!
	Amelia clenches her fists and grits her teeth. If Jamie isn’t here at this time, she might rush to kill Jamie.
	"Where's your mummy?" Amelia takes a deep breath and asks Ian in a soft voice for fear of scaring him.
	"Mommy is changing clothes upstairs and will come down in a while." Although Ian has an opinion on Amelia, he should be polite and he keeps his cute gentleman's style from beginning to end.
	Amelia is hesitating whether to go upstairs and fight with Jamie to vent her anger. Then Jamie goes downstairs.
	She is wearing a white dress and a pair of white low-heeled shoes. She looks very pure and pleasant.
	Ian sees Jamie coming down, watching Jamie happily as if he is wearing her clothes. He claps his fleshy little hands and throws the iPad aside, and then stands up and walks to the spiral staircase.
	Jamie walks down the stairs and sees that Ian looks like a gentleman, with a hand behind his back and a hand extended to make an inviting gesture to her.
	"This lady, can I dance with you?" Ian says in a soft and sweet voice and he blinks at Jamie.
	"Oops." Jamie is delighted by his behavior. He’s obviously a little boy while he is pretending to invite a beautiful woman to dance like a grown-up adult.
	But she still gives her hand to Ian and starts dancing with him.
	"This young lady looks so beautiful tonight. Why not go back with me? Let me take you to enjoy a delightful life, okay?" Ian pretends to be a playboy and whistles handsomely.
	Jamie's feet are tripped, but fortunately she stabilizes her body in time. She looks at Ian's soft and cute face and wants to pinch it. Bad boy. He’s still so young but he knows how to tease a girl!
	"Bunny, what should you do if a girl comes to our family to ask for marrying you?" Jamie is deeply worried about her son's future. If he attracts too many women who want to marry him, how can she choose a daughter-in-law from them?
	No, Ian is still young. She will throw her out if any girl dares to take away her Ian in the future!
	Ian tilts his head and considers about it. He follows Jamie's hand in a circle and says seriously, "No, no girl in the world is more beautiful and gentler than mummy!"
	Oh my god!
	Jamie is so delight that she kisses on Ian's little face. She really grins happily.
	It’s her son who is so sweet.
	"In case there is one, Bunny can take her home." Ian continues to add a sentence.
	Jamie's feet are tripped again. This time, she doesn't stabilize her body. Therefore she falls forward and she is about to press Ian.
	At this moment, a large hand crosses her waist to hold her firmly. Before Jamie is relieved, she is pulled into a fragrant embrace.
	Dan looks at Ian's cute face and stretches his hand to flick his forehead. "Bunny, what's the first article of Mummy Rules?"
	"Mummy is the most beautiful, gentlest, and virtuous one. Mummy is our queen!" Ian subconsciously recites this sentence. After he finishes speaking, he finds that something is wrong. He stares at them angrily with his small mouth covered.
	The Mummy Rules are proposed by Dan. In order to train Ian to be a good baby with the concept that mummy is the queen, Dan also asks him to memorize the rules.
	"What are the Mummy Rules?" Jamie blinks and she’s somewhat confused in what they are talking about. But hearing Ian's answer, the smile on her face is even brighter.
	Hah hah. She loves to listen Ian’s praise.
	"Mommy, this is a secret!" Ian interrupts Jamie's question, and then he looks at Dan. Although his vision is gentle, he still looks angry. "Mommy, Daddy, I'm going to be late if I don’t leave. It's disrespectful to others. "
	Jamie snickers with her mouth covered and stops teasing him. She looks at Dan curiously. Do they still have some secrets?
	"Dan." Amelia watches the happy scene of their family for a long time, and finally speaks until they have finished speaking.
	Dan turns around when he hears the sound. He sees Amelia standing there awkwardly. His eyes are faint but not sharp. But there is a trace of attention and vigilance in them, "What's the matter?"
	Amelia purses her mouth a bit in grievance. She and Dan are from a family, but now, she looks like an outsider.
Chapter 259 She just wants him to admit that he has a girlfriend.
	Jamie also turns her head to look at him with a hint of obvious threats. Quickly, tell them, tell these women that you already have a girlfriend. Let them stop their fantasy!
	Dan isn’t hurried to answer. His eyes look down and he seems cold and lazy. His fingertips twirl around the edge of the glass and then he gives Jamie a charming look. He says, "Girlfriend ..."
	As soon as he opens his mouth, he attracts the attention of everyone in the party. All of them raises their heads and wants to hear his words. After all, he is a mysterious man.
	And Jamie almost looks through him with her eyes. If he dares to say that he is single to attract others, he will not be allowed to go inside her bedroom tonight!
	"Don't you see it?" Dan's words change and he turns his head to look at Jamie. And he immediately turns everyone's attention to her.
	She just wants him to admit that he has a girlfriend! She doesn’t want him to point out who his girlfriend is in front of so many people!
	OMG!
	Jamie blushes slightly and kicks Dan under the table. However, Dan hasn't been kicked yet and Dan grabs her calf. He puts it on his thigh.
	Jamie feels that this situation is very embarrassing and her face turns red. And she is a little bit annoyed. She’s afraid that it will be discovered by others so she doesn’t move violently. Therefore she can just be under his control.
	And this annoyance seems to be shyness in everyone’s view, which is the best evidence of Dan's words just now.
	The women who are interested in Dan feel disappointed and look at Jamie who has not spoken since entering the room.
	Jamie, while is bearing the fierce gaze of these women, is also wary of Dan's deliberate flirt. Her pressure is really great!
	"You, you are enough!" Jamie can’t help it and she maintains a polite smile on her face, pretending to put her hair on the cheek behind her ear and whispering.
	"What?" Dan pretends not to understand and the force on her calf suddenly increases, which almost causes Jamie to jump uncontrollably.
	He’s... a big hooligan!
	Jamie grits her teeth to make herself look less weird. If she lets these women see their interactions under the table, she will definitely be killed by those eyes.
	"Miss Jamie becomes a CR designer at such a young age. You must have gone through a difficult time. "
	See. Jamie rolls her eyes secretly. She knows that these women must not let her go easily.
	Although there are much scolding words in her heart, Jamie still keeps a smile on her exquisite and beautiful face. She looks at the woman who creates troubles for her. She is the one whose saliva almost falls into the nipples just now.
	She is looking at Jamie provocatively, and the words are euphemistic, but the underlying meaning in the words means that Jamie’s job as a CR designer is won by some unknown reason. Probably because of being with Dan, then her position is obtained by Dan’s help.
	As soon as hearing her words, those people, who look at Jamie with envy and jealousy, suddenly change their looks. Now, their visions are full of disdain and contempt.
	Dan doesn't say a word and he looks cold. But his vision is dangerous. He puts Jamie's calf down and gently holds her small hand.
	He doesn't care what others say. But once it mentions her, he’s impossible to ignore it.
	Jamie blinks at him and signals that she can handle it. She has often experienced this thing. These women are much weaker than the terrible lovers of Ethan. If she can’t solve it, what’s the meaning for her to be a so-called shield to Ethan’s romantic affairs?
	"It's really not easy. I won this position by my own ability and strength. Those who have worked hard like me must know it. It's just that there are many people who have enjoyed their success in an easily way. What do you think about whether I’m right?" Jamie answers it with calmness and her voice is clear and light, which makes people feel very comfortable to listen to her.
	Jamie appraises all the people present, except for the one who makes the trouble for her, so the expressions on the faces of the on-lookers is not that gloomy when they hear her words.
	The dining table is like a battlefield. No one will care if you are really capable, they just want to see whether this play is good or not. It is just a fun!
	"Miss Moore is right. You are certainly not the one who enjoys the success easily." The woman's expression slightly changes and she answers with a smile.
	"Don't you always like the work designed by Miss Jamie? Why do you still doubt her today?" A girl who sits with those women looks at them in confusion and she seems not to realize the influence of the words she just said.
	Jamie raises her eyebrows and looks at the girl delightedly. Why she is so cute? Her words are more useful than any explanation.
	After hearing these words, the women' expression change and they all stare at the girl who is speaking.
	The girl shrugs her shoulders and lowers her head to continue eating as if nothing happens.
	"Do you want the clothes designed by Jamie?" Dan turns the round disk on the dining table and notices that Jamie points at the hairy crab. So he takes one in the bowl and shells the crab for her.
	The women' eyes light up. They really want the clothes but they can’t abandon their dignity. After all they just satirize the ability of Jamie.
	"Mr. William is so generous that it should not be a problem to send us a few sets of clothes."
	Jamie stares at Dan's movements directly, looking forward to the crab meat.
	Dan raises his eyes to glance at them. Even the men wish for the clothes. He purses his lips and says with regret, "Unfortunately, our Jamie's work will not be easily given to those who want to enjoy the success easily. Please make an appointment if you want. "
	Enjoy the success easily.
	Jamie twitches her mouth and her smile turns more obvious quickly. She looks at the man who is peeling the crab meat and feels moved.
	What he says completely reaches the point!
	Suddenly, the woman with V-neck cloth become froze in her expression. And the expressions of other people present are awkward but they have no way to fight with Dan.
	He has worked hard to save your company and help you to shoot a promotional film. It is really immortal to offend the people who once helped you. And who will ever do this?
	What's more, how will they have that courage? Although Moon is famous, it is more inferior to CR and the gap is huge.
	Jamie looks around and knows their expression. If it’s not because that there are so many people present, she must laugh loudly.
	But Dan seems that he doesn’t notice them and puts the peeled crab meat into the Jamie’s bowl. This behavior breaks everyone's understanding of Jamie again. Dan says, “Well, I forget that my Jamie doesn’t receive the reservation any more. If you really want, it all depends on her mood. "
	Everyone's expressions become extremely bad and their eyebrows are all frowned. What does he mean by saying that it all depends on her mood if they really want the clothes?
	Also for "My Jamie", are you here for dinner or for showing your love? Does he want to hurt their single people?
	"Mr. William is really humorous. Hah-hah." The general manager says so quickly when the atmosphere is a little quiet and he’s afraid of annoying the big boss.
Chapter 260 This is not a joke.
	Those people are relieved. It turns out to be a joke.
	"This is not a joke." Dan takes some lobsters into the bowl and continued to peel the shucks. He glances at everyone faintly.
	Jamie, who is sitting next to him, cares about nothing and just enjoys her own food. The crab meat is delicious and juicy. She is busy enjoying them. How will she still have a mood to care about how they think of her?
	The relieved atmosphere turns silent again. The general manager takes out his handkerchief to wipe the sweat. He looks at Dan and finds that he is not unhappy and he feels relieved.
	"Let’s enjoy the meal. It’ll be cold if we don’t eat."
	Hearing the general manager's words, those people don't want to think of anything and are ready to eat.
	The atmosphere during the meal is finally better and lively when they are having the meal.
	But those people's eyes keep switching back and forth between Dan and Jamie. The more they look, the sadder they feel.
	It’s said that Dan is cool and arrogant. He never gets close to female and is once suspected of having a particular hobby.
	However, according to the situation before them, it is not that he doesn’t get close to female, nor that he has a special hobby. It may be that the right person does not appear. Maybe it’s because the Miss Right still doesn’t turn out.
	Everyone's eyes are on Jamie, but when they see the scene that Jamie keeps stuffing her small mouth with food, they cover their eyes.
	Does such a famous man in the business world actually like this girl’s style?
	"Don't you eat?" Jamie asks him as she eats. He is peeling the shells and giving her dishes but the food in his bowl doesn’t remain untouched.
	"Yes. I will eat later..." Dan moves quickly, leaving her with a small pile of shrimp flesh which is dipped with soy sauce and is put into the bowl in front of her.
	Jamie chews quickly, swallowing the food in her mouth. Then she grabs a rice-flour roll from her bowl and asks him to open his mouth. Then she takes the opportunity to put it into his mouth.
	When everyone sees this scene, their eyes are almost scared to drop out. They really come to show their love. They definitely are!
	Are they going to show their love and irritate them?
	Dan frowns and doesn't like the faint rice-flour roll in his mouth. But it’s given by Jamie so he swallows it with an enjoyable expression.
	"Mr. William and Miss. Moore have a really good relationship. Is good news coming soon?" The topic that just fades is mentioned again. Jamie is eating happily but some annoying people are unwilling to make anyone feel better.
	Dan glances at the man lightly without respond as if he doesn’t hear it.
	He doesn’t answer, and no one dares to ask again.
	After eating for a while, maybe she drinks too much. Jamie really wants to pee. She whispers to Dan, telling him that she wants to to the toilet and smiles to the people present. Then she walks to the toilet.
	After she walks to the toilet, she discovers that the toilet in the private room is temporarily unavailable because of maintenance.
	She has no way but to leave the room and goes to the public toilet on this floor.
	The public restroom is in the middle of this floor, which is very convenient for those guests to use because it takes just a few steps.
	It doesn't take long for Jamie to enter the toilet and another person follows.
	When Jamie comes out, she sees the woman in V-neck cloth leaning against the wall and lighting a lady's cigarette and smoking slowly.
	Seeing Jamie coming out, the woman in V-neck cloth inadvertently extinguishes the cigarette in her hand and walks up to her with her hands around her chest. She looks at her up and down, and then she raises her two big breasts. She says disdainful, "You’re just an ordinary one."
	Jamie's mouth twitches and she glances at the woman's chest. They are big enough but she doesn't know if she will suffer when she starts running.
	"What's wrong with you?" Jamie looks at her with her pink lips. She always feels that this woman seems to have evil thoughts. She made trouble for her at the table before and now she is here to stop her.
	Had she eaten more recently that she becomes handsome and even women are in love with her?
	Jamie thinks with narcissism.
	The woman in V-neck cloth doesn’t pay attention to Jamie’s question. Instead she laughs smugly and says sarcastically, “If your reputation as a great designer is ruined, do you think your work can be sold even if Mr. William stands aside by you?"
	Although her words are straightforward, it’s really sharp. It likes threats and provocations. That feeling is hard to tell but it will make people think over for a long time, as if something will happen next.
	After the last kidnapping, Jamie is particularly sensitive to words like reputation. She steps back and watches at the woman alertly, "What do you want to do?"
	The woman in V-neck cloth laughs suddenly. Her eyes turn insidious and venomous in a short moment. She turns around and hits the wall fiercely. Maybe the force is too strong that her body turns soft and she collapses along the wall.
	What does she want to do?
	Jamie's eyes widen. Seeing the behavior of the woman in V-neck cloth, which is almost equal to a suicide, she is very puzzled.
	Before she can figure out what she is scheming, the woman in V-neck cloth stands up against the wall staggeringly with a large blood stain on her forehead. And blood is constantly flowing out and covering half of her face. It looks terrible.
	The woman in V-neck cloth glances at Jamie's stunned expression, showing a strange smile and walking out of the toilet.
	"Someone is killing me. Help!" Jamie is about to go out and hears the woman outside the toilet screaming.
	Jamie surprises for a moment. When she goes out, she sees that some people have gathered outside the toilet and the woman is pointing at Jamie and shouting, "She’s killing me. Help me ..."
	If Jamie doesn't understand what she wants to do at this time, she is really silly.
	This woman wants to frame her. However, can the crime of murder be rested on others casually?
	She doesn't seem to offend her, right?
	The voice of the woman attracts the waiters of the hotel, who come over and ask about the situation.
	"Quickly call the police to arrest her. Look, she will kill me. She will let me die!" The woman pulls away her forehead's hair, revealing a bloody wound, which looks terrible.
	"Well... How great hatred she has that she even breaks her head...”
	"Yes? Why are all the pretty girls now so cruel? They really dare to do it."
	"Maybe it's a good show for a wife and a mistress."
	The people around are all talking and wanting to see what the final result of this good show is. But no one is willing to involve in it.
	"She lies!" Jamie's face turns pale. Although she doesn't know what the woman's idea is, she will never allow others to defame her reputation. If this matter is taken seriously by the woman, she will go to the Public Security Bureau to file a case. She will be stained as murder in her future life.
	"Definitely, she hurts herself. It's none of my business." Jamie says with her lips pursed.
	"You just lie. Will I hit the wall by myself? Am I getting mad?" The woman turns to question and looks at Jamie's eyes with a smirk.
Chapter 261 It’s planted
	The manager nods and looks sharply at Jamie, "This lady, what else do you want to say? If not, please follow me to the police station."
	"Wait." A cold and hurried voice comes slowly from far to near. A slender and proud figure comes slowly over here and his face looks serious.
	Those who watch the show can’t help but retreat to make way for Dan when they see Dan coming here. They look at him in amazement.
	Jamie's tense nerves relax as soon as she sees him, and she looks at him with grievances, seeming to complain.
	"Mr. William." The manager recognizes Dan when he sees him; he bows his head politely and respectfully.
	Dan nods in response and then he walks to Jamie. He gives her a reassuring gaze and turns his head to look at the woman coldly, "Do you say that she hits you? Is there any witness or physical evidence?"
	When the woman in V-neck cloth sees Dan come, her eyes begins to dodge, which is not as arrogant as before. "At that time, only me and her are in the toilet and the wound on my head is the physical evidence ..."
	"Only you and her. There are no witnesses. So it’s the explanation from your side. Maybe you deliberately plan to frame her?" Dan's sharp eyes are fixed on the woman's face tightly without letting a trace of her expression go.
	The woman is shocked when she hears it and a picnic flashes in her eyes. But suddenly she thinks of something and says pitifully, "It takes for granted that Mr. William tends to help your girlfriend. Miss Jamie is still a designer of your company. Even if I die here today, I can just bear it... "
	After hearing these words, the crowds begin to discuss and everyone is condemning.
	She is Jamie! She is a designer who is very popular recently and is the heroine of a perfume poster. How will she become such a murder? If the news is revealed to the media, it will cause a sensation again.
	"Mr. William, if today's affairs are not handled properly, it will have a negative impact on Miss Moore and the reputation of the company. Do you want to send her to the police station for investigation?" The manager is a little embarrassed. There are so many people present, and it is impossible for everyone to let go of it easily. Otherwise even their hotel will be criticized.
	Police station? Jamie's face looks pale and subconsciously she grabs Dan's sleeve. She can’t go to the police station. She is now the target of all media. If she enters the police station, her reputation will be ruined even if she is not sued and is proved innocent.
	"Dan, I really didn't do it. Please believe me ..." Jamie bites her lower lip tightly, staring at the woman stubbornly. Her head is working to think quickly.
	She can't be framed in this way and she can't let those who want to harm her succeed easily.
	The more dangerous the situation is, the calmer Jamie will be. She will carefully think about every detail that happens tonight, not letting go of anyone.
	It is impossible that this woman just wanted to bring her to a dilemma at the cost of her life, just because of a quarrel on the dinner table. What’s more, they didn't have any intersections before. There must be someone behind the scenes who wants to frame her.
	If someone was present at that time, it will be good for her to prove. Then there will be no such things as now.
	Wait. It has no need that someone should be present!
	Dan just looks down with his clear eyes in a soft emotion, watching at Jamie and nodding firmly, "It must not be you."
	It must not be Jamie and he believes her.
	Even if no one believes her, he will believe her.
	Dan's words undoubtedly give Jamie great confidence. She raises her lips and her panicked heart gradually settles down. It is enough for her with his words.
	Jamie walks over to the woman and stands well. She looks at the woman with her chin lifted slightly. The confident emotion is emanating from the inside, "Can you tell me why I hit your head?"
	The woman's hair is messy, and she looks up like a mad woman. She straightens her body and looks straightly back, "How do I know why you were crazy? You grabbed my hair as soon as I entered. You also hit my head against the wall and warned me not to seduce your man! "
	"Is it right? Are you sure?" Jamie asks Amelia with a smile around her lips.
	"I'm sure! Hurry up and call the police car to take her away. Otherwise what should we do if she is going crazy?" The woman turns to grab the manager’s arm and uses her finger to point around the present people.
	The onlookers subconsciously step back and move away from them.
	The manager looks at Dan with some embarrassment and asks him what he means.
	If Mr. William refuses to let them take her away, who will dare to take her?
	"Let the police come. I have no opinion." Jamie says faintly. What she says surprises the onlookers.
	Let the police come? If things cannot be explained, she is really going to be jailed.
	Dan glances at Jamie's confident, radiant profile, pursed his lips, and nodded to the manager.
	Manager gets their advice and dials 110.
	The woman in the V-neck cloth is still powerful and she is still looking at Jamie arrogantly, as if she is sure that Jamie is going to bear bitter fruits.
	Jamie ignores her and she takes advantage of this time to approach Dan and whispers something close to his ear.
	Dan narrows his eyes. There’s a warm and fragrant breath near his ear. He admires her in his eyes and he gently nods. Then he calls Derek and whispers to give him few orders.
	Derek nods after listening and then he leaves.
	The police quickly come to the seventh floor and disperse the crowds around. And the manager comes to the leading policeman to explain the situation to him, and then he walks to between Jamie and the V-neck woman.
	"Do you know that this is an intention to murder and may be sentenced to death?" The police officer looks at Jamie with a stern expression on his face, studying the expression on Jamie's face.
	Jamie is not scared by him. There’s a light smile on her face. She is not anxious. "Sir, don't make a rash judgment first. How do you know that this is not someone's intentional framing?"
	The officer raises his thick eyebrows and looks at Jamie. He asks, "What evidence do you have that someone deliberately frames you?"
	The V-neck woman looks at Jamie proudly. There is no surveillance video in the toilet. She deliberately chose to go in when there was no others. She is pretty sure that there will be no second person in the toilet except for her and Jamie.
	Evidence? That is simply impossible.
	"Of course." Jamie answers firmly and her pink lips are tightly pressed because excitement. She tries hard to suppress her laughter. Her exquisite and beautiful face shines brightly under the wall light above the corridor.
	"Sir, this woman just wants me to die. Don't be fooled by her, hurry to arrest her away ... Ah!" The woman says these with pride. But she is stunned when she knocks into the gloomy eyes of Dan.
	She doesn't dare to look directly at Dan's eyes. Those black eyes seem to be able to see through the human mind. People are afraid to look directly at them, especially the cold emotion in his eyes, as if there is ice that can never been melted in his eyes and they hit the heart directly.
Chapter 262 The evidence
	What a horrible man.
	The woman's body shrinks back and her eyes begin to dodge. She becomes guilty, not knowing whether the thing she does for money will kill her or not. But she knows that if she doesn't do it, that person will kill her in instant.
	The police officer ignores her and looks at Jamie, "What about your evidence?"
	Jamie knows that the purpose has been achieved and that woman no longer conceals her intentions. Her voice is calm and quiet, and there is no trace of confusion again. “Everyone who is here can hear this woman’s words that I hit her against the wall.”
	"You have said that just now. Is this your evidence?" The woman looks at her coldly, trying hard to fight against Dan's dangerous eyes and saying so.
	"Of course not. It’s just to prevent you from having a chance to repent after a while." Jamie smiles as Derek walks over and gives Dan a transparent paper bag.
	Dan takes the paper bag and looks at it. Then he gives it to Jamie.
	"This lady, if I remember it correctly, this was the first time we met, right?" Jamie deliberately covers the contents of the paper bag and asks casually.
	"Yes."
	"That's all right. Sir, this is my evidence." Jamie takes her hand away and hands the paper bag to the police officer. She continues, "This is the cigarette that this young lady smoked after I entered the toilet. You just need to extract the DNA on the cigarette holder, and then you find out that it is from this lady. "
	Speaking of this, Jamie thanks in hard to this woman for her habit of smoking. Otherwise she really has no way to prove that she is innocent and she can only be wronged.
	The woman's face turns pale, and she really doesn't expect that such small details will be remembered by Jamie.
	It's just a small detail.
	"No, it's not me, it's none of my business ..." The woman shakes her head and takes a few steps back. Then she points at Jamie's expression fiercely, "It's you who are framing me!"
	"We will see who played this trick after our inspection results come out. Miss, please also cooperate with us in the investigation." The police officer glances at the woman and then he gives the paper bag to the subordinate. The subordinate takes the paper bag and immediately rushes to the nearest hospital for examination.
	The woman in V-neck cloth leans against the wall without the arrogance before. Her whole person exudes a decadent atmosphere.
	She smoked with that cigarette. No matter how the DNA is tested, it will be hers.
	It is impossible to have a chance to win.
	She can't admit it. If she admits, that person will never let her go!
	Soon, the police officer, who took the physical evidence to the hospital for inspection, comes back and hands over the inspection report to the police officer. The DNA is 100% consistent.
	"Miss. You deliberately frame up people. You have to come with us." The police officer puts away the report, and two police officers step forward to take the woman away.
	Jamie exhales and pats her chest. She is really scared. She is almost framed up by this viper woman.
	"Very clever." Dan gives her an admiration very pertinently, and his gentle eyebrows are full of tenderness. He raises his arms and rubs her head.
	"Are there any rewards?" Jamie looks at him with a sly and playful hope in her eyes.
	"What kind of reward do you want?" Dan raises his eyebrows and holds her little hand, walking towards the elevator. After the matter just now, they don't plan to go back to that party.
	For that kind of party, Dan doesn't have any interest in attending. Adding the incident that just happened, his impression of Moon is once again harmed.
	They leave the hotel, preparing to return to the manor.
	Dan receives a phone call on the midway, and someone reports that the police car taking that woman has accidents. The woman dies on the spot, and the policemen are slightly injured.
	Who is he? Who actually targets at Jamie again and again?
	Is that Hooson?
	_
	The next day, Jamie doesn't go to work in the company either. She has nothing to do but hold the ipad to spend time playing games.
	A few days later, the video will be released on the media and she and Dan are now the popular people in the eyes of all media. They may be eaten alive if they don’t take attention.
	In fact, compared to the current attention, Jamie prefers to paint design drafts in low-key and make clothes. Then she can sell it to earn a lot of money, which is better than not even going out now.
	"I’m very busy now so you can tell me quickly..." Jamie picks up the ringing phone and answers it directly. She says straightly while she puts the phone near her ears.
	"Are you so busy? Do you need to be so ruthless? What are you busy doing? Are you seeing a handsome guy or giving birth to a baby?" Wendy's happy voice comes from there.
	Jamie raises her eyebrows and her smile seems to tease her, "Oh, who are you? Wendy? I think you’re lost in that hunk’s arms and you can’t find the direction. Now you realize it and come to ask what I am doing."
	Since knowing Wendy is accompanying Eddie, Jamie isn't worried at all about Wendy will commit suicide or feel depressed.
	Wendy and Eddie is a perfect match.
	Jamie feels that she should take back the previous sentences. It should be said that if Wendy likes Eddie, she will get a result, which is different from falling in love with Duke. She even lost her self-esteem when she liked Duke.
	Jamie is not optimistic about Duke. That kind of ungrateful man is not good. After all, Wendy once blocked the knife for him. What about him? He forgot it immediately.
	Bad guy!
	"I'm dating with Eddie in the sea-view garden now. We looked around. He and I had had several good days. Are you envious?" Wendy's sizzling drink sound is nothing more than triumphant. Jamie really wants to rush over the screen to beat her.
	She can still hear the wind from her side, and she doesn’t know what she is playing so crazily.
	"Envy, I'm so envious! ... Have you finished? I'm finished if you’re enough. I won't disturb the world of you two." Jamie thinks that their relationship has developed really fast. If Eddie wants to win the favor of Wendy, who has no conscience, she will immediately tie a gift bow on Wendy's head and send her out.
	And she will do it without hesitation.
	"Well, what are you going to do by hanging up so anxiously?" Wendy stops her quickly with a little bit of sorrow, "Do you have a date with Dan? OMG. Why doesn’t he take action since you have already got him?"
	"What does this have to do with dating?" Jamie asks curiously and she seems confused.
	Should it be like this between boyfriends and girlfriends? Damn, she has already given birth to Ian. The date is probably not important than before.
	"Don’t tell me you don’t want to. It’s okay even if you go out shopping with him to shop or eat anything. Then you can act coquettishly to him and asks him to buy something for you. Did you ... Did you never date with others in the past five years? "Wendy's incredulous exclamation comes from there with a hint of pity.
Chapter 263 I don't always push him down!
	"Jamie, you are so stupid. With such a good man, can you put him there as a decoration?"
	Jamie touches her nose and her expression looks innocent. She hasn't made an appointment. How will she know?
	But what Wendy says seems to be funny. Jamie is a little tempting.
	"If you don't date him, can you let him every day to promote your feelings without pushing him down?"
	"No, I doesn't push him down every day!" Jamie bites her lower lip and argues fiercely. She doesn't have that eager obviously. It’s he who thinks about pushing her down every day!
	"Wait. I'll take him out for a date when he comes back!" Jamie, who is stimulated by Wendy, doesn't react at all that she is screwed to say it.
	"I’m waiting!" Wendy answers a few times, and there are a few calls from the boy calling her. She answers "Come here" and says to Jamie, "I'm going to play. You can think about it by yourself."
	Then she hangs up the phone decisively.
	Jamie throws the phone aside, and is not in a mood to play the game again. After thinking for a while, she opens the website decisively to search.
	After searching, Jamie finds that what it says about dating is almost the same as when Dan used to take her out for fun. It is so simple.
	Then the question is coming!
	How can she ask Dan to date with her?
	Jamie is lying on the recliner with her hands behind her head, looking at the blue sky, which looks as if it is washed by water. She is thinking but feels a little nervous and eager.
	Will she need to go directly to Dan and tell him with a shy expression and soft voice, and then say: The weather is good today and the food is quite delicious. Would you like to date me?
	Nonsense!
	Thinking of the scene in her mind, Jamie feels that it is far beyond her ability. She shakes her head and touches the arm of goose bumps. She just feels awkward.
	How can she do that?
	_
	At noon, Jamie hears the sound of the car stalling outside the door and looks out with her head. At this time, Dan should not be back. So who will come?
	Dan changes into indoor slippers and walks in. His hands are put in his trouser pockets as he walks forward.
	When Jamie sees him, she doesn’t want to eat anymore and immediately puts down the knife and fork in her hand.
	"How will you come back? Does the company go bankrupt?" Jamie steps on the furry slippers and follows behind him, happily speaking.
	She is full of ideas about how to let him date with her. She doesn't know what she says.
	Dan stops and turns around to flip hard on her forehead, squinting softly with a smile on his lips, "You will not get your wage if the company goes bankrupt."
	Jamie covers her forehead, and her eyes lights up when she hear of wages. It counts that and it's almost time to settle the wages. Money, please come into my pocket!
	Dan opens the door of the study, and Jamie reaches her head to look, hesitating whether to follow up.
	Just as she struggles in her mind and stands at the door, Dan hugs her, his beautiful eyebrows frown. A trace of smile appears in his black eyes, "Don’t you come in?"
	Jamie stuns for a moment. She blinks her eyes and steps in as if she fears that he will regret. Then she closes the door.
	Jamie is a bit cautious because she came in secretly last time when Dan wasn’t here. She follows Dan while she looks around, fearing that he might have discovered that she once came inside.
	She remembers the sticky note in the book last time but she still doesn't know what it is.
	Dan stands in front of the ebony desk. He opens the drawer and bends over to find something.
	Jamie is a little hesitant. At this time, it’s best to take the opportunity to ask him about the dating. But it is impossible for her to say directly. Moreover, regarding Dan's busy work and his personality, he will not go to those places to have fun with her.
	Therefore, she has to find another way.
	An idea flashes across Jamie's mind and her eyes light up suddenly. She strides to Dan and leans on the desk with both hands, blinking and looking at him, "Dan, don't you get a little annoyance and impatience since you’re always busy with business affairs?"
	After that, she blinks hard again.
	Dan glances up at her and shakes his head to show his disapproval. "It's fine."
	"Then don't you think it's tiring to always look at piles of documents?" Jamie glances at the documents on the desktop quickly and thinks even those dense words can smash her to death.
	"No." Dan denies it without consideration. Over the years, he spends most of his time working on files and facing computer. Tiredness is normal and he has long been used to it.
	"Don't you think about giving yourself a few days off to relax?" Jamie doesn't give up and continues to ask.
	"Holiday?" Dan finally stops researching and looks up to stare at Jamie’s face, which is full of expectation. He pulls the chair behind him to sit down. "You are very strange today."
	In normal times, she doesn't like to talk about such topics.
	Jamie twitches her mouth, looking at the stupid man in front of her with some sorrow. She even hints him so obviously. Can’t he see it?
	"Tell me. Do you make trouble again?" Dan pulls out a document and opens it. His eyebrows frown slightly and he turns a few pages quickly.
	"Am I the kind of person who can only cause trouble in your mind?" Jamie is angry and glares at him with her cheeks bulging.
	"Then what do you want?"
	Jamie decides to give up. The man is so silly that her brain cells are almost run out. She is so shy and embarrassed to tell him directly.
	She looks at his deep eyes and says seriously, "The world is so big and I want to travel to have a look."
	Dan stares at her with a bit of doubt, "So, you mentioned those topics to hit me to take you to see the world?"
	"Yes." Jamie nods immediately, not realizing that the "world" she says is exactly the opposite of the "world" in his mouth.
	Dan’s eyebrows relax. He takes the document and walks around the desk, staring at her for a long time. He says lightly, "I'm going back to the company first, wait for me at home."
	Does he leave?
	Damn!
	Jamie stomps hard on the soft carpet with her hands on her waist. Although she is far away to be disappointed, her expectation gradually turns into upset.
	Dan, who sits in the driver's seat of the car, thinks over her words for a moment. He doesn't expect Jamie to be interested in the "world". What's good about that kind of thing? But if she likes it, it's not difficult to get it for her.
	_
	Night.7, who is by the side of Ian as usual, suddenly receives a call from Night.1. Night 1 tells him that someone pays a high price to buy the treasure of a jeweler shop under the name of Gilbert’s hidden property. That jewelry is special and is managed by Night.7. So Night 1 called her.
	Night.7 is very happy at that time because this is the treasure of the shop. Before, there were always people who were frightened by the price and declined to buy it. But this time someone actually buys it.
	But when Night.7 sees the noble and cold man in the cafe shop, she immediately flinches.
Chapter 264 It’s Dan, the father of Ian, her boss!
	OMG. It’s Dan, the father of Ian, her boss!
	It is quite troublesome. The property is owned by Ian but his father comes to buy it from his son. And she must sell it at an extremely high price. What kind of misunderstanding is it?
	Night.7 feels that this scene is really embarrassing. She twitches her mouth and takes off her sunglasses, unveiling her greatly glamorous face. Her eyes show her serious attitude and she does not dare show any cold-shoulder to the man.
	This is her boss's father. If she messes it up and lets her boss know, then she will have to bear all the bitter fruits.
	"Hello." Night.7 takes off the sunglasses and places it on the table, smiling and saying hello to the man at the opposite.
	Dan raises his head. He keeps his countenance and looks at Night.7 quietly for a few moments. His eyes express his indifference and he calmly responds in a cool voice, "Hello."
	"Are you the gentleman who wants to buy ‘World’?" Night.7's voice sounds still polite but she has an appreciation for Dan's attitude. No matter who sees her face will be shocked. Even Night.1, who is self-contained, is occasionally tempted by her. But she doesn't expect that this man doesn’t be even a little surprised by her beauty.
	Even so, Night.7 doesn't dare to have any thoughts about Dan. She just thinks about quickly handing over the things and running away. After all, she doesn’t dare to accept the money of her boss's father.
	"Yes, do you bring the item?" Dan nods slightly and takes the coffee cup in front of him to take a sip. He makes action casually and calmly, which shows kinds of beauty when he does any action.
	Night.7 takes out a bag from the backpack. There is an exquisite black box in the bag. She opens the box and turns it to face Dan. "This is the 'World'. There is only one “World” in the world. It has not undergone any craftsmanship and polish. It’s so tiny and light that you may not feel its weight when you wear it. So it’s convenient to be brought. ”
	A necklace made of obsidian lies quietly in the black box.
	This is the necklace that once shocked the world. There are rumors for it. Someone once said that giving this gift to your lover is tantamount to binding her and your own destiny together. Then you will not be separated.
	Dan naturally does not believe this. He knows that the last wearer of the "World" is the daughter of the Gilbert, Adele Gilbert, who disappeared after all the people of the Gilberts died overnight.
	"You can decide a price." Dan puts the necklace back and looks at Night. 7.
	Night.7 suddenly feels a little curious. Many people who are attracted to come here will abandon after listening to her offer and conditions. The boss's father is quite different. This man really has the sincerity to buy this necklace.
	If so, even if she wants to earn his money, she will not dare.
	If not, it is another matter.
	"The price ..." Night.7 raises her hands to manage her slightly curled long hair. She rolls her eyes a little hesitantly with a few coughs. "I want 10% of CR shares."
	That's why those people will abandon.
	If you change it into money, then ten percent of the shares are still worthy of a lot. It can be said that you can become a very powerful shareholder.
	"Okay." Dan ponders for a few seconds before agreeing.
	What?
	Night.7 watches at him surprisingly. What? It relates to the shares. Did she hear it wrong?
	But she considers that Dan owns half of the country C and he will not take these shares into consideration. The price seems to be lower.
	However, CR is the stronghold of the William family. It’s where the main strength of the William family exists. If you own 10% of CR's shares...
	That is equivalent to hold a part of Country C in your hands.
	Its value is much greater than that of "world".
	Night.7 suddenly reminds of Ian's soft and cute face, which looks exactly like the man in front of her. They not only look alike in appearance but also have similar dispositions.
	She smiles and begins to talk about other topics, "I want to know if you buys this necklace at a high price just because you know the legend and want to give it to your beloved woman."
	"Yes." Without hesitation for a second at this time, Dan replies.
	His gaze is very similar to the shine of obsidian necklace. It looks as deep and dark as the whirlpool which owns several layers of waves. It seems that it can drag people into it so it’s dangerous and fatal.
	Obviously this jewelry is just a small stone. Why will Jamie like it?
	Dan thinks that probably because it is something that her mother once worn. So she wants to see it.
	But he doesn’t know he completely misunderstands Jamie's meaning.
	Jamie makes it clear that she wants to ask if he has time to go out to have fun. But the theme is ended by him in one sentence.
	It is estimated that Jamie will feel collapsed and resentful if she knows this.
	The thoughts of big boss really cannot be followed by the ordinary person and his thoughts change too frequently.
	Night.7 nods as if she is considering about something. She has been protecting Ian around him. She naturally knows that the recent relationship between Dan and Jamie is quite good. This necklace must be bought for Jamie.
	Ian shows most favoritism towards his mummy. So for this necklace, she not only needs to give it to Dan but also she can't take him one penny. Otherwise she is the one who entraps people who are on their own side.
	"In this case, you can take the thing away. We just make a friend and our store also needs you to come back for shopping in the future." Night.7 closes the black box and pushes it to Dan with a smile.
	Dan frowns and refuses to take the box. He says, "Tomorrow I will let someone give you the share transfer."
	Night.7 is stunned after hearing his words. Can you not embarrass us? I am willing to send it to you for free!
	"No need. We'll send you this necklace. You need to take care of our business in the future." Night.7 wishes that she can beat herself to death. She shouldn't have mentioned any shares to Dan on a whim. How will she know he will agree?
	She is over. She's going to die. She makes a trap for the boss's father. The key is that it is a big trap.
	"Why?" Dan raises his eyes and stares at Night.7 with his sharp gaze. Actually he has great displeasure.
	Now that he has promised to use shares for exchange, he will definitely do it. Now what does she mean by repentance?
	"It..." Night.7 can’t answer at all. She can’t say kinds of words like "Your son is the owner of our shop. You are his father and his property also belongs to you."
	It’s so stupid.
	When Night.7 is about to cry while facing Dan's sharp gaze, Night.1 calls in.
	If in the past, the phone of Night.1 will definitely be answered after waiting for a long time. But today it is really connected as soon as it rings, "Hello, it is me."
	"Why do you answer... so fast? What's the matter with you?" Night.1's surprised voice with disbelief comes into Night.7's ear.
	The speed of answering the phone is almost in line with the speed of launching the spaceship and even is faster than that!
	"I'm sorry that I have to answer the phone." Night.7 covers the screen of the phone and smiles at Dan apologetically. When he nods, she immediately stands up and walks out.
Chapter 265 This is mine
	Dan holds up the coffee cup and takes a few sips. Then he puts it down and looks at the black box with a hint of ambition in his eyes.
	"Damned it. Night.1, do you know who is the buyer? The father of our boss. Isn't it killing me to earn money from Ian's father? Doesn’t the conflict arise between people on our own side? It’s so ridiculous, right? "Night.7 can’t help complaining to Night.1. If she knows this task is so difficult, she won’t come even if he begs her!
	Facing Night.7's extremely fast speech without pauses, Night.1 is silent for a few seconds and gives her several words, "I know it."
	"What? Do you know it? Have you already known that the buyer is Ian's daddy? Why don’t you tell me?" Night.7 widens her eyes and pokes a few times on the phone screen with her fingers.
	He must have done it on purpose!
	"I have told you but you hang up my phone before I finish talking." Night.1's voice sounds a little cold. He doesn’t speak a needless word and he’s unwilling to waste any energy to explain. But there seems to have some disgust for Night.7’s IQ in his tone.
	Night.7 is even more regretful after hearing his words. Why doesn’t she hang up the phone after listening to all the words of Night.1? Now she really wants to cry and she even can’t make up for it, "So what should I do now? Should I take 10% of his shares? Ian will kill me if he knows it. "
	Although Ian looks cute and is usually kind, when handling something, he is decisive and courageous. He is more ruthless to himself than enemies. More importantly, he likes playing a trick on others.
	Although Ian’s psychology and tactics are taught by Night.7, Ian’s skills are better than hers. He is best at attacking the enemy's weaknesses and beating the enemy quickly with the minimum power.
	Night.7 even regrets that she shouldn't teach all to him. She should have kept a way for herself so that she won't be controlled by a small cute boy.
	"Since he insists on giving, you can only accept it." Night.1 thinks for a while and says, "If you accept it, it also belongs to our little boss."
	This is true! Why is she so stupid? What is the difference whether it belongs to son or father? There is no difference!
	"Okay, I see. Let’s hang up." After listening to his words, Night.7 doesn’t have any worries and hangs up the phone with peace.
	This stock will eventually be handed to Ian. As for how Ian will handle it, it’s not her business.
	"Sir, as what we discuss at the beginning, the transaction can be made. I hope there will be opportunities for our cooperation next time." After saying the last sentence, Night.7 takes a deep breath. Oh my God, it is finally resolved.
	A large amount of money flies away.
	"Yes." Dan sees her actions of packing the black box up and handing it over. Then he takes it. Without saying anything, he stands up and leaves the cafe.
	When Night.7 sees him leave, she feels finally relieved. Her whole person is paralyzed in the seat. It is more tiring than finishing ten tasks.
	_
	In the manor
	After dinner, Ian gets into the room and goes to play games. Night.7 hasn’t told him of what happens today. She plans to give him surprise after signing the contract tomorrow.
	Jamie returns to the room early and has nothing to do. She continues to play the game on the ipad.
	She deliberately buys a long meow toy from the Internet and places it in the middle of the bed. Therefore she can lie on one side, and Dan lies on the other side.
	Don't ask her why. Jamie just feels unhappy and wronged.
	He is really a bad guy. Why does he work overtime all day?
	"What's this?" Dan asks when he approaches Jamie and takes the long meow toy with his two fingers. Then he asks with a slightly scornful expression.
	Jamie doesn’t look back and lies down beside the bed. Her two slender legs wave comfortably in the mid-air. "That's my new partner. I'll sleep together with it in the future."
	Dan raises his eyebrows. The movement that he is about to put it down changes to throw it to the ground far away when he hears her words.
	"Why do you throw my toy?" Jamie turns around and is unhappy when she sees that her long toy is thrown away. She puts down her ipad and jumps to check the toy.
	Dan's eyes narrow and he looks at the long toy in her arms with unkind gazes. He is a lively person who has warm temperature. Why can't he compare with a toy?
	"Give it to me quickly." He reaches out to her and his voice sounds overbearing and irresistible.
	Jamie subconsciously wants to give him the long toy. But when she thinks of the stupid thing she does at noon today, she immediately puts her hands back and hugs it tightly, "No, this is mine!"
	Dan's blue veins beat on his forehead for a few times. He stares at the long toy for a while and he shows a soft and light smile which can confuse people.
	"Can a toy hug and kiss you? Do you think you can screw with a toy as what you do with me?" His voice is low and magical, which generally makes people feel dizzy.
	Jamie's clear eyes show a little confusion. The words echo lightly in her mind and the long toy in her arms is also loosened.
	Dan immediately reaches out and snatches the long toy. The smile on his face disappears and he pulls the long toy’s ear with slight disgust, "What is the good nature of this toy? Throw it away."
	"Dan! You actually used you handsome face to confuse me!" When Jamie can react, the toy in her arms has been taken away by Dan. Thinking of being confused by his charming smile just now, she is a little angry.
	She's really not a nympho. She’s just a nympho to him!
	"If you really have no affection to me, why will you be fooled?" Dan doesn't care about her complaint and the long toy is kneaded into various shapes in his hands.
	Jamie is anxious when she sees it. This long toy isn’t easily bought and she uses a lot efforts. It is soft and cute. It is out of way for the toy to be kneaded in this way!
	"Stop. Give it back to me!" Jamie reaches out to grab it. But the height difference between them is so great that she can’t get the long toy even if she stands on tiptop, but then Dan would raise his hand.
	Damn height difference. What the hell “the most adorable height difference” is?
	Is it her fault to be so petite? Definitely it's not. Why has Dan always won her on the height?
	"If you want it, you can get it by yourself." Compared to Jamie who is jumping up and down from time to time to reach for the long toy in his hand, Dan seems much calmer. His whole person remains motionless in her tugging behavior. He doesn’t move at all. He just prevents her from getting the long toy.
	This thing is planned to sleep with Jamie instead of him. Can he allow it?
	"You put it lower!" Jamie jumps up and still is unable to touch the long toy on his hand. Then she thinks of an excellent way.
	She grabs Dan's white shirt with her two hands, and her whole person hangs on him like a koala. She treats him as a big tree and crawls up little by little.
	Dan's body is suddenly anxious because of her actions. And a sexual feeling appears in his smiling eyes while his throat rolls up and down. He looks uncomfortably at Jamie's stubborn face. He is upset, thinking that is this thing really so important. Is it more important than him?
Chapter 266 It’s terrible
	It has to say Mr. William is jealous of a long toy.
	Jamie acts just like when they are playing hide-and-seek and she always climbs the tree little by little. She climbs on him without realizing how painful the man in front of her is.
	"Jamie." Dan's voice is low and hoarse with some natural charm. A warm breath sprays on Jamie's round and small earlobe, which causes her to tremble.
	"What?" Jamie replies as she reaches out for the long toy. It will be fine although he is so high and his legs are so long. However, he also has long arms. Will he really want to win others with these physical advantages?
	Dan's wrist turns and the long toy falls to the ground as he lets it go. Before Jamie can see it, he presses Jamie on the soft bed.
	"You are igniting me." His voice becomes lower and lower but it also gets more charming. He watches at Jamie's eyes with more emotions, developing a trash of desire in his eyes.
	Jamie's face turns red. It isn’t the first time she has experienced so she knows what he is referring to. She purses her mouth and turns her head away. Why does he understand the key at this time? Then why didn’t he know her hint in the noon?
	Jamie is more than depressed, but she is mad at the thing happened at noon.
	She reaches out and beats Dan's chest, which is originally just an act of venting grievance. But in Dan's eyes, it becomes a silent invitation...
	He leans over to kiss the little mouth.
	Damn it!
	Jamie opens her mouth vigorously and takes a bite on his lips. He dares to kiss her again so he owes her bite!
	Dan's eyebrows frown but he doesn't let go of her. Instead, he takes the opportunity to gets his tongue in. He bites her lips slightly with a meaning of punishment and there appears a slight bloody taste. It is tasted in his mouth.
	"Hmm ..." Jamie doesn't have any resistance to Dan's deliberation. After a while, she becomes weak and leans in his warm and generous arms because she has no energy and can’t support her body.
	"Jamie, can we do it?" The sexual feeling in Dan's eyes almost drowns him. He puts his head against Jamie's shoulder socket and he murmurs in a low voice. And his whole body exudes a wild charm.
	His body is very hot, as if to burn her skin, which causes her to shrink slightly.
	How dare he ask her about this?
	Jamie grins her teeth and her sanity finally returns. She uses all her strength to kick Dan's body. Dan doesn't know she will do this and his body is a little weak after the kiss. So he doesn't even notice her action and he rolls down the bed.
	Dan falls on the soft carpet, rubbing his waist which is painful. He raises his eyes to look at Jamie with some annoyance. Fortunately, he dodges in time. Otherwise he will be harmed by this girl today.
	How can she kick the man’s most important organ?
	Jamie shrinks her shoulders. She is afraid to look at Dan's eyes. Her pink lips twitch, and she is a little bit wronged. Then she wraps herself in a quilt and turns around to sleep.
	Is she... getting angry with him?
	Dan's mouth twitches, he suddenly thinks of a famous quote that Bruce often says to flirt with girls.
	The woman can't be spoiled. Otherwise, she will beat and bully you.
	Dan, however, prefers to spoil Jamie. Even if she is indulgent, he will be happy as long as she’s spoiled by him.
	This is an almost paranoid indulgence of love.
	He shakes his head helplessly and stands up against the floor. He looks at Jamie, who wraps herself into a bun. He doesn't speak and his lips are habitually pursed.
	The room is very quiet, and the orange lights build a warm atmosphere and softly flood the entire bedroom. It shines on Dan, which makes him look a little tender. But his eyes have an inaccessible coldness.
	Jamie is wrapped in the quilt and does not fall asleep. Her small face is hot because of being covered, so she pulls the quilt down to reveal her head and breathe the fresh air.
	She knows that Dan hasn't left, and she can even feel the tenderness that comes out of his eyes, which places straightly on her.
	After a long time, Jamie feels that someone is approaching. Immediately she closes her eyes as if she’s angry. Her exposed slender neck can feel a spray of hot air, and then she feels something on her neck.
	When the cool thing suddenly comes into contact with her warm skin, Jamie flinches slightly and returns to calmness.
	She feels that Dan stays for a moment and then gets up to leave. There are footsteps of him walking around and the sound of closing the bathroom door.
	He's gone.
	Jamie rolls over and looks at the closed bathroom door, feeling a little uncomfortable in her heart. Is it so bad that she is so unreasonable to make trouble like this? Well, it seems that she just showed her bad temper.
	Jamie drags the thin quilt a few times, and then she remembers something on her neck. She reaches for it. It seems like a necklace.
	She immediately gets up from the bed and looks at the mirror.
	It is a black necklace, and its rope is also black. It is very mysterious and retro.
	The black stone has small lines and it is known that it is naturally formed. The experience and vision formed in the past few years allow Jamie to know that this pendant has never been artificially polished at a glance.
	What is this?
	Jamie holds the pendant and can’t put it down. She has seen many rare treasures but they are not as visually impressive as this one. Not only is it low-key and restrained, bus also all the essence is focused on simplicity.
	However, it seems that she has seen this thing before. Jamie narrows her eyes for a while and looks at the "World" with more and more serious feelings. She is quite sure that she must have seen it before. But where has she seen it?
	She can’t remember it so it should have been a long time ago.
	What did Dan mean to wear this on her just now? Is it the compensation for dating?
	Jamie plays with the pendant, thinking delightedly in her heart. She feels so sweet that she is about to fly, completely forgetting the scene that she kicks Dan out of bed.
	She looks at the mirror for a while, and hears a subtle sound from the bathroom. He seems to come out. After hearing the sound of opening the bathroom door, she quickly runs to the door like a little pug. She stops Dan who is taking his footsteps.
	Dan is stunned and frowns at her, not speaking.
	"Dan, is this for me?" Jamie points to the "World" around her neck, and her voice is sweet and soft, which is completely different from the grumpy appearance just now.
	Dan is slightly relieved when he hears her voice. Fortunately, she likes this.
	He nods slightly but says nothing. He turns over and walks across her to leave the bathroom. When he passes Jamie, Jamie sniffs gently and the light shower fragrance fills in her entire breath.
	Her face turns red slightly and her skin has the most natural and charming color. Her heart beats like a drum. Without Dan’s response, she is not discouraged. She turns around and runs over to follow behind him, “Dan , this necklace is really beautiful. Its texture is delicate and natural while the lines on it are not formed easily overnight. It is not easy to find such a small piece. You are so great."
Chapter 267 I will treasure it
	Seeing her so happy, he knows she must like this necklace.
	Although it looks beautiful, more importantly, it is given by Dan. It’s just like the ring of the "Lovers for the Life" and it also has a marvelous meaning.
	Dan ignores her but walks to the sofa to sit down. He picks up the remote control and turns on the TV.
	Jamie is a little depressed. She shouldn't treat him like that just now. Why did she be so angry? she was like a fool just now.
	"Dan, this necklace must be expensive, right? Thank you for giving it to me. I will treasure it!" She raises her small hand as if she makes a promise. But she still does not get a response from him.
	Does what she says make him angry?
	Jamie blinks a few times, and there is a trace of uneasiness and confusion in her eyes. Is he angry because she just kicks him?
	Sucking her nose, Jamie leans forward in front of Dan and sits next to him, almost wishing to stick on him.
	"Dan, this thing is so beautiful. It must have a name. What's it called?" She leans closer to Dan, resting her chin on his shoulder, as if she wants to see the emotions in his eyes clearly, although there is not useful at all.
	Dan's eyes are seemingly covered with a layer of mist, which makes people unclear about the emotions inside. You cannot guess what he is thinking.
	Just when Jamie thinks that he won’t put any attention on her, she sees him opening his mouth, "World."
	World?
	Jamie stuns for a moment and immediately has reaction. The name of the necklace is "World."
	She narrows her eyes and says with a smile, "Why did you suddenly want to send me a ‘world’?"
	Because you are my world.
	This sentence echoes gently in Dan's heart, but he doesn't say it out. But he answers, "Don't you say you want to see the world today?"
	What?
	Jamie is stunned again. The hand of holding the "world" in her hand is tightened and she understands it as if she is enlightened.
	At noon today, she hints that she wants to go out to see the outside world. Unexpectedly, he sends her a necklace called "World".
	When he heard her words at noon today, she thought he will regard it as her casual words and will not put it in mind. But she does not expect this man to be so silly and cute. In his way, he makes up for the regret in her heart.
	How can this man be so stupid and so adorable?
	Thinking of this, Jamie can’t help but reach out to knock on her head. Why is she so stupid? Have you killed your IQ while dreaming?
	Jamie rolls her clear eyes and then stretches out her hands to hug Dan's neck. Moreover, she gives a sip on his handsome face, "Thank you darling, I love this "World "very much. I like it the most."
	She adds a sentence in the end to show that she really likes it.
	Dan's eyebrows relax by the intimate emotion in her action and words. The coldness fades away and he looks gentle and affectionate under the halo.
	It’s fine as long as she is happy.
	_
	Finally, the day for the release of the publicity film comes. The perfume promotional film is playing on the huge screen.
	On the screen, there are Jamie's slender figure and Dan's arrogant and cold posture. It breaks the traditional way of using single model or star, so the effect is imaginable.
	In the entire country C, in the continuous broadcast and playback of the promotional video, it seems like a bomb in the hearts of all women.
	Jamie and Dan are even more popular than those perfumes. Dan is a major figure that everyone knows. Even if there is no promotional film, he still has the power to control the entire country C.
	Jamie, however, looks unfamiliar for everyone. The smart and exquisite image in the promotional film makes her Weibo (Chinese counterpart of Twitter) followers increase to 15 million in just half a day. This is beyond Jamie's expectation.
	It's in only half a day and the effect is excellent.
	Following the popularity of the promotional film, the arts companies and directors come to contact with her. For Dan, they dare not think about him. But for Jamie, it is easier to get.
	But how will Jamie agree? She joined the filming of the promotional video because it was related to clothing, it was a kind of self-improvement. But her dream and career have always been clothing design. For actors and celebrities, we just forget it.
	She can't do it and is too lazy to do it.
	After she has almost died of falling from the wire, she gradually becomes somewhat resistant to it.
	At this moment she stays in the manor and enjoys the leisurely rest, but is unaware of the crazy scenes outside.
	In the hospital, Ryan knows that it is the release of the promotional video today and sees the promotional video of the perfume as soon as he turns on the TV.
	Jamie, who is beautifully swimming in the water, has a graceful and light posture, which is extremely attractive to the eyes. Even the special nurse who cuts the apples on the side can’t help but stop to watch.
	Ryan glances at it with surprise and feels upset. Jamie is beautiful and it is undoubted. But what really makes him sad is not that he does not see Jamie’s beauty in person, but because her beauty is shown to another man.
	He has no chance from the beginning that he was defeated because of time.
	On the screen, Dan and Jamie hold hands to swim towards the bottom of the swimming pool. They look at each other tacitly and smile. The sweetness that showed on their eyebrows can be deeply felt by outsiders.
	This is just a filming so it's not true. Jamie just loves him for a short time. It's impossible for her to have such an affectionate look.
	Ryan comforts himself. But the more comfort he feels, the sadder he is.
	The special nurse is so addicted that she accidentally cuts her fingers and the blood is dripped on the white bed.
	"Mr. Jack, I'm sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose." Special nurse says sorry with her hands behind her back.
	Ryan's eyes suddenly change. "You can go out. I'll leave alone by myself."
	"Okay, I'll go out first. You can call me if you need it." Special nurse nods politely and turns around to go out.
	In the ward, there is only the romantic and beautiful background music on the screen and the scene of Dan and Jamie nestle together.
	The film is really beautiful and they look really matched with each other.
	Ryan is absent-minded for a while, and suddenly someone comes in to turns off the TV.
	"Why do you watch such film? If you like her, just fight for it." A man wearing sunglasses who can't see whether it's a man or a woman is standing next to the bed and even the voice is deliberately disguised. The person holds the remote control in his hands and throws it up and down to catch it.
	Ryan doesn't look back. He doesn't care much about the man's words. "It's not necessary. It's not the time yet."
	"You are right, are you ready to start now?" The man continues.
	"You can do it by yourself. I will manage my own business." Ryan shakes his head helplessly, looking sad.
	The man doesn't say anything. Maybe he has already understood so he just disappears in the ward.

Chapter 268 Get married
	When Jamie returns to CR, it is two days after the promotional video’s release. Fortunately, CR has a good security. As long as Dan's car enters the area of CR, even if media reporters have a great power, they can't rush in. So she is very relieved.
	Back at the office, Secretary Sam comes into the room.
	"Miss. Moore, this is an appointment document. Please have a look at it to see if there is any need to make corrections." Secretary Sam gives Jamie a copy of the document and shows it to her.
	Jamie sets yogurt aside before she takes a sip of it and takes the document. She looks at it carefully with a hint of doubt in her eyes, "What is this?"
	"Jason Frank, the only son of the jewelry tycoon David Frank, is going to hold an engagement ceremony with Harriet Chris, the daughter of the Chris Consortium next month. This is an appointment document for you to make a dress for the engagement ceremony," Secretary Sam explains.
	"I haven't seen them." Jamie raises her head in confusion. She hasn't heard these two people. How will they find her?
	What's more, she doesn't promise anyone to design for them.
	"This is arranged by Mr. William and I will select for you according to the appointments. You only need to design the clothes." Secretary Sam looks at Jamie's struggling face and feels a little funny. Everyone envies her privileges. Why will she be unhappy?
	"Mr. William means no matter how much money it gets, it all belongs to Miss. Moore."
	Jamie's eyes light up. Although it is too sudden, as long as there is money coming into her pocket, she will have no problem no matter what she has to design.
	No one will say no to money.
	"Okay, I see." Jamie quickly scans the appointment document. After seeing the deposit paid by them, her eyes directly shows her desire for money.
	"There is one more thing. Miss Chris asks you to meet at Star Hotel at noon today and wants to talk to you about the clothing requirements." Secretary Sam leaves this sentence before he comes out. Then he turns away.
	Jamie doesn’t care much. It’s much like FS. If it is a customer's clothing appointment, the designer must have a face-to-face conversation with the client in person so that it will be more convenient for the design and will avoid some unnecessary errors.
	At noon that day, Jamie arrives as scheduled.
	Miss Chris is already waiting there. When Jamie walks in, she stands up first. She shakes hands with her politely and sits down gracefully.
	Although she has early heard that the designer named Jamie is young and beautiful, it is not as real as today when she sees her today.
	Harriet smiles slightly, "Miss. Moore is really young and looks like a student who just comes out of campus."
	"Thank you. I'm already twenty-three years old this year." Jamie knows that Harriet Chris is a bit unconvinced about her age and she doesn't mind.
	Harriet nods slightly, watching at Jamie without observation but a trace of respect. The designer matches with her own choice. She wants a special wedding. Of course, she has to scheme on the wedding dress even if it is an engagement ceremony. It can't be sloppy.
	"I don't know for Miss. Chris, what kind of wedding dress is the most beautiful in your heart?" Jamie takes a glass of juice in front of her and takes a sip to moisten her throat. She seems to chat casually.
	Originally, Harriet Chris's don’t know how to express her thoughts. But it is completely dispelled by Jamie's question. Some other ideas pop in her mind, "Lively and elegant, simple and generous, adding beauty at the same moment and showing it suddenly."
	"Miss. Chris's idea is good. But I personally think that what you mention is more suitable for the wedding ceremony. If the most beautiful thing is only seen once, it will be more precious." Jamie says slowly, and then takes an ipad out of the leather backpack behind her. She hands it to Harriet.
	"These are my previous work and are wedding dresses for wedding ceremonies, so when designed them, I was very careful. The bride must be the most beautiful one on the date of marriage. If you show that beauty on the engagement ceremony, you will lose your expectations."
	Jamie has encountered a lot of similar things. There is no shortage of anxious girls like Harriet Chris in Britain. At the engagement ceremony, they wore a wedding dress that should be worn at the wedding. They really gained a lot of amazing eyes and were proud for a long time.
	But on the wedding day, they put on another wedding dress that didn't have much effect. The clever people would naturally have no interest in it by comparison.
	Why?
	Because Jamie refused to design dresses for the final wedding ceremonies for these women.
	People who are eager for success are not worthy of getting the best or better things.
	But Jamie still suggests that she can surprise everyone on the date of the wedding ceremony, which is better than on an engagement ceremony which has no substantial meaning.
	It depends on whether Miss. Chris will accept her opinion or not.
	If she insists on doing that, then Jamie will never design a wedding dress for her.
	Money is worthy but the principle values more.
	Everyone who pursues for art has more or less some strange hobbies and Jamie has such a hobby.
	She only designs clothes for people who let her feel comfortable.
	After looking at the pictures on the ipad, Harriet becomes firmer in her eyes. She really picks the right person. Jamie does have the ability, but the engagement ceremony shouldn’t be sloppy too. Why can’t the two kinds of beauty show separately?
	"Miss. Chris, being too greedy may be counterproductive." Jamie knows what she is thinking and speaks lightly.
	She is a little depressed why she doesn’t believe her. Even if it is an engagement ceremony, she has her ways to design an equally good dress for her without affecting the surprise on the wedding ceremony.
	Harriet stuns a little bit and immediately knows what Jamie is referring to. She is not angry because of her words and pushes the ipad to her, "I know, Miss. Moore can just do it. If the effect is good, I also want to invite you to design the wedding dress for my wedding ceremony. "
	Jamie grins and nods, "Okay, Miss. Chris. Please rest assured. Just come and get the finished product at the end of this month."
	"Okay, thank you." Harriet takes the handbag on the table and stands up, smiling and shaking hands with Jamie again. Then they walk out of the restaurant together.
	Jamie calculates that there are more than 20 days before the end of the month to hand over the finished product. It is still very early so she is confident that she can do it well.
	But Jamie never thinks that the plan cannot keep up with the changes and the troubles will come so fast. It reveals all the things hidden under the peaceful surface.
	_
	After the meeting with Harriet, Jamie goes to the hospital to visit Ryan. According to the doctor, his condition almost gets well now. He is still recuperating, and he can be discharged in a few days.
	"Is it over?" Dan's low voice comes from the phone with a touch of tenderness.
	Jamie smiles like a cute cat which is quite happy and she pulls the collar and says, "It's over. Now I’m in the hospital. I will go back after seeing Ryan." 
Chapter 269 Mummy is really in danger
	"Okay." Dan murmurs. His voice sounds a little annoyed but doesn’t put it in mind.
	"Then I'll hang up. Wait for me." Jamie smiles while biting her small mouth. She can feel the jealousy from this big boss.
	The elevator just reaches the first floor where Ryan's ward is located. Jamie habitually puts the mobile phone in the sleeve of her clothes. The wide sleeves make the phone hard to find from the outside. Her mobile phone is relatively large and she is not used to put the phone in her pocket. It is not safe to hold it in hand so she will not do so.
	When she opens the door of the ward, she sees Ryan, covered all over with blood, lying on the cold floor. His chest slightly rises and falls and his eyes half open. He is dying.
	"Jamie ... Go away..." A figure appears in Ryan's blurry vision. He tries to distinguish who it is and murmured difficultly but Jamie can only see his mouth.
	"Ryan? What's wrong with you?" Jamie freezes for a few seconds and steps to Ryan. She crouches down and looks at him.
	"Hurry up ... Here is dangerous!" Ryan's voice is hoarse and his chest raises and falls a few times. He clutches her arm tightly and pushes her away.
	"What's wrong with you? Who hurts you? I come to call someone now ..." Jamie's hands are covered with blood from Ryan's body. The heavy bloody smell in the ward makes her feel that she can’t breathe.
	Ryan's eyes shrink sharply, as if he sees something terrifying. He pushes Jamie away while she is thinking of going out to call others. But he is hit by a heavy object on his back, which makes him let out a heavy hum.
	Ryan's face looks paler than before, and large drops of sweat keep dripping from his forehead and drop on the back of Jamie's hand.
	"Be... be careful ..." He faints after he says the last sentence.
	Jamie just wants to turn her head to see who is attacking him. Suddenly, her neck is attacked by heavy objects. Then her whole body softens and she falls in a faint.
	_
	Dan, who is sitting in the office, is signing a document brought by Secretary Sam. He has a faint look, elegant posture, and a standard posture to hold pen.
	Just as he is about to write the last stroke, his hand suddenly becomes weak. The tip of the pen is broken by his sudden action, and the ink spills on the paper.
	Dan is slightly stunned and his eyebrows frown. His dark eyes expose doubt and he watches at the broken nib while he is slightly absent-minded.
	It’s very strange. What is wrong with him today? Is something going to happen?
	Secretary Sam sees the broken pen quickly and immediately takes out a pen, which he always prepares, from his pocket. He passes it to him, "Mr. William, here you are."
	Dan throws the broken pen aside and signs the last one with this pen. But his mind begins to be anxious.
	It seems that something bad is about to happen.
	What is it then?
	"Has something happened in the company lately?" Instead of putting down the pen, he plays it and tries to restrain his anxiety.
	"No, the company has been working well recently," Secretary Sam replies.
	Dan frowns and he suddenly takes the cell phone on the side when he thinks of something. He presses the shortcut key to give Jamie a call.
	At this time, an internal call comes in. Dan moves the phone away slightly and answers it.
	"Mr. William, there is a kid at the reception saying that he is your friend and wants to see you. And he doesn't want to leave so I come to ask for advice." The voice of the receptionist comes from the phone.
	Kid?
	Dan suddenly thinks of who he is and there will be no one except Ian. "Well, I know him. Let someone bring him up."
	"Okay." The lady at the reception hangs up and looks at Ian who wears a pair of sunglasses and a small school bag on his back, she smiles at him. "Little boy, let me bring you inside."
	"Okay, thank you, beautiful lady." Ian's voice is sweet, and what he says is extremely sweet, which really pleases the lady.
	The lady takes Ian into the president's special elevator, and soon they reach that floor.
	As soon as he leaves the elevator, Ian sees Dan coming out of the office and approaching him.
	"Daddy." Ian screams sweetly, and walks towards Dan in spite of the startled look of the lady. He is hugged in Dan’s arms and comes into the office.
	"Does the boss... have son?" The lady looks at the back of the father and son and widens her eyes incredulously.
	She won’t stop the kid if she knows who he is!
	"Don’t you have classes? Why do you come here suddenly?" Dan takes Ian's sunglasses off and puts it on the sofa, squeezing his small face with a spoiled smile on his face.
	"Bunny asks for leave." Ian frowns like an adult and looks at Dan seriously with his finger pointing on his chest. "Bunny feels it weird in here."
	A bit of worry appears in Dan's eyes. "What's going on? Are you uncomfortable? Daddy comes to call the doctor."
	"No, daddy." Ian shakes his head. "Bunny always thinks that mommy is in danger."
	It is said that there is telepathy between mother and child. He and Jamie are no exception. Every time when something happens, he will feel it.
	This time he feels uncomfortable in his heart, so he specifically asks Night.7 to find Jamie. But he gets the news that Jamie is not in the company and he comes here in person.
	"Jamie ... Damn it!" Dan murmurs softly. It seems that he thinks of something. He stands up immediately and walks toward the desk. He picks up the phone that he just puts on the desk.
	There is a busy tone while the phone does not shut down.
	"Where will Mummy go if she isn’t in the company?" Ian is also anxious. It’s sure enough that his feelings are right. He doesn't guess it wrong, and mummy is in trouble!
	"She comes to the hospital to see Ryan." Dan finishes talking and hugs Ian to walk out quickly.
	In the hospital ward, there is a pool of dried blood stains on the ground and the leather backpack that Jamie is bringing to meet Harriet today. Ian's backpack and Jamie's are of the same series so he can recognize it at a glance.
	Ian crosses the blood and goes towards the backpack to pick it up. He turns around and looks at Dan, "This is indeed mummy's bag because it’s as same as mine."
	Dan's eyes are filled with worry and seriousness. He looks at the blood on the ground and his hands, which are hanging down on his side, held tightly. His whole person feels angry, as if he is falling into ice and fire.
	"Daddy, this may not be mummy’s backpack. It’s very likely that they hit mummy when she comes in the ward and take her away with Uncle Ryan." Ian looks at the blood on the floor. Although his mind is almost chaotic, his thinking ability is still there, and he quickly analyzes the situation.
	"I know that the target of those people might be Ryan, but Jamie suddenly met them. So she was taken away together. If so, she should be safe now." Dan narrows his eyes slightly, thinking quickly in his mind and trying to find out a suspect. 
Chapter 270 Their goal.
	Are those people's goals really Ryan instead of Jamie?
	Dan squats down and looks at the blood on the ground. Why does he have an intuition that the matter is for Jamie in this time?
	This finally comes. Since the fall happened, he knows that someone has been planning something behind.
	So who is it?
	Hooson?
	"Derek, immediately block the entire city A. In addition, go and investigate who Ryan has been with these days and bring Hooson to me." Dan commands in a calm voice.
	Ian does not relax. It is the first time that he called Night 1 during these days. He ordered him to find Jamie.
	But this time, things don't seem so simple.
	_
	It seems that after a long period of time, the heavy eyelids can't be opened. The more you want to open your eyes, the more uncomfortable your brain will be.
	Where is it?
	Jamie's eyelids move a few times and then she finally opens her eyes. Looking at the vague scenery in front of her, she props herself up.
	Unexpectedly, here is not like the abandoned warehouse or factory when she was kidnapped where the environment was remote and cold with black dirty water on the ground.
	Instead, here is very clean and looks clean and bright.
	Perhaps because of the good environment, Jamie's tense heart relaxes a little, but there is no way to move it violently.
	She feels weak all over her body, and is so paralyzed that the biggest action she can do is to lift her hand.
	It looks like she is very free. But she is completely controlled in this place and she can't escape.
	Jamie tries to lift her legs out of bed annoyingly. But she can’t lift it up even though she exerts all her strength. Her whole person is tired and falls on the bed.
	Actually someone has dared to give her medicine!
	Yes! What about Ryan?
	At this moment, the door of the room suddenly opens and a girl dressed in an exotic style comes in, holding a tray in her hand. She just walks to Jamie and puts the tray on the side table.
	"Hey beauty, where are we? What about the man who comes with me?" Jamie doesn't expect to get the answer of the stupid question of who brought her here from her mouth. But if she gets the location, she can figure out a direction for escaping.
	She has a feeling that they are not in City A.
	But who can send her and Ryan out of City A in such a short time? Will there have been premeditated plans to do these things?
	Although the girl covers her face with light veil, from the outline under the veil, she can know that she is not from city A.
	The girl doesn't speak while she is placing dishes.
	Not talking?
	Jamie snorts and she has her own way.
	She suddenly screams and she curls up her body in pain. She covers her abdomen and looks painful.
	After all, the girl is young. She doesn’t understand the complicated thoughts in Jamie’s mind. And her superior ordered her to take good care of this woman.
	Jamie's eyes flicks. And she bites her lower lip involuntarily. As expected it is not City A, even the accent is not of people from City A. So where is she?
	"I'm fine, but I want to go to the toilet. Can you help me?" She looks up at the girl and asks pitifully.
	The girl hesitates for a while, presumably thinking that the medicine is still on her body. So she doesn't worry about it and helps Jamie to take her to the bathroom.
	The toilet and the bathroom are connected. There is a large window in the bathroom. Jamie moves with great effort to the window. So she can look out through the window to see the outside.
	She looks outside from the window and sees that it is green. But it doesn’t seem very remote and there are often cars coming and going.
	How can these people, who kidnapped them, put them in this place? Isn't it easy for them to escape or ask for help here?
	After noting the surrounding terrain, Jamie moves back again and knocks on the door, indicating that the girl at the door can come in and help her out.
	The girl helps her back to the bed and leaves.
	There is some exquisite and delicious food on the table. Even though Jamie is a foodie, she is also a smart and principled foodie. God knows whether they will put anything on it or not. If she accidentally eats it, she doesn’t know what will happen. .
	So the food and water can't be touched here, but fortunately she is not hungry now.
	Jamie lies on the bed, thinking quickly about the possibility of escaping.
	It looks like there are no precautions here; it is a very normal villa. But judging by the girl's cautiousness just now, it is very likely that someone is monitoring her in secret.
	Therefore, she can't act rashly. She must know her own situation as well as her enemies’ in order to be victorious.
	_
	However, in just a few hours, Dan, Bruce, and Duke's people almost searched through the entire city A. Even when Wendy knew that Jamie is missed, she asked Eddie to send someone to look for her. The power of the five’s organizations covers all over country C. and now they just starts from city A but finds nothing.
	It is as if she disappears suddenly with no trace at all.
	"Dan, Ryan has only recently has a contact with a woman. The woman is Hooson's sister, named Anna. They are abandoned by their parents since they are young. They grow up in an orphanage and have a good relationship. I also find out that Hooson is the boss of Moon. "Bruce is very different from usual, and changes his former attitude to become serious.
	For Anna, Bruce is really familiar with her.
	This woman approached him again and again and she was very strange. Every time she approached him on purpose and pretended to like him very much. But if she really likes him, why didn't he feel her sincere?
	"Go on." Dan's eyes turns serious and he frowns. There is a chill on his face. Once his calmness is broken, he will become terrible.
	"I find a very strange thing. Since Ryan appeared, Hooson had appeared once. At other times, it seemed that he was nonexistent and had disappeared." Bruce says solemnly.
	This thing seems nothing special but this is its weirdest point.
	Hooson and Anna have a good relationship. It is impossible for him to leave his sister alone in City A and leave by himself. Hooson and Ryan do not have any intersection, and her sister does not have a job. So why did she often meet Ryan?
	If something goes wrong, there must be a cause. If it has no problem, no one will believe.
	"I've let Derek research it for a long time. As a result, Hooson went to France for a business trip, so he hasn't been in Moon for a long time." Dan stands up and his hands are put in his trouser pockets. He stands before the French windows with his back facing them. “I didn’t feel relaxed for the result and let Derek send someone to France to investigate his company and to search for it extensively. Guess what the result was. "
	Duke, who hasn't spoken, listens to them carefully. After Dan asking this, he is curious, "What?"
	
Chapter 271 Ian has found the clues
	Dan turns around and looks at them sharply, "Hooson is not in France."
	"What?" Bruce and Duke look at Dan in shock. "Isn’t he in France? Then why did he claim that he goes to France for a business trip?"
	"Hooson is very weird. Even the only time he appeared after Ryan appeared was when he rescued Jamie." Dan glances at far away and continues, "Hooson hit Jamie not because the car got out of control, but for deliberation. Moreover he took the opportunity to take her to the hospital. "
	There is a flash of light in Bruce's eyes. He watches at Dan and says firmly, "Hooson was deliberately looking for a chance to approach Jamie!"
	"But why did he approach Jamie? Except that he approached Jamie, he didn't do anything, which is too incredible." Duke answers.
	For this time, things are full of doubts. Originally, the most possible suspect should be the person who takes Ryan and Jamie away. But now it seems that it is not so simple.
	"Hooson is very weird from the beginning. Because he has a relationship with Ryan, it might be the case that he is the one who is playing tricks behind." Dan says. "To sum up, we should find Jamie first."
	At this time, Ian trots in from outside the door, holding a stack of documents on the table to show before Dan, "Daddy, Bunny finds the clue."
	"What is it?" Dan takes a stack of documents. Bruce and Duke pick up other documents.
	"In fact, Hooson’s real aim is mommy. Because the previous falling incident and the kidnapping happened on mummy last time, are all planned by him!" Ian also just receives the news from Night 1.
	It seems that the Hooson is probably the one who takes Jamie. But has he been hiding in the dark just to take Jamie away at this moment?
	What is the reason?
	Jamie doesn't seem to have anything that will benefit him.
	Will it be ...
	"Daddy, does this Hooson have relationship with the Moore family?" Ian walks to Dan and asks calmly.
	After reading the documents, Bruce and Duke look at Ian in surprise. They know that Dan’s son is definitely not ordinary people. But they don’t expect that the information, which they have to work hard to get, would be easily found by him. Moreover, it's so detailed.
	Ian is decisive and calm when he speaks and does things; he is anxious but not self-disturbed. Ian is really similar with Dan.
	"The Moores?" Dan ponders, "Why do you ask like that?"
	Ian purses his lips and looks at Bruce and Duke. Then he answers, "Uncle Bruce and Duke are both good brothers of Daddy. So I believe that you will keep secret about what I will say later, right? "
	"Sure. Don’t you believe our relationship with your dad?" Bruce looks at Ian expectantly. He becomes more and more curious about him and is fond of this little Ian.
	Dan looks at Ian and he has a hunch that it might be related to the identity of Night.1.
	Why Ian knows that extraordinary person and makes him willing to protect him from behind? It must have some reasons.
	"My mum's mother is the daughter of the Gilberts, Adele Gilbert. I believe you must know that. I don't know if you have heard of the myth ring." Ian looks at them and his voice sounds sweet but very convincing.
	Myth ring!
	How can anyone with status like them not know the power of the myth ring?
	When the Gilbert still existed, their power spread throughout the entire country C, which just liked what Dan is today. The huge family controlled half of the country and even farther to the abroad. At that time, the Gilberts had strong financial power and authority, which was tantamount to the thorns in the eyes of all powers.
	Everyone would be jealous of them.
	It is precisely because of this that the Gilberts were killed overnight and were attacked by various people and eventually went to extinction.
	The Gilberts turned into ruins overnight, and no one survived. Only Adele Gilbert survived.
	Who would have thought that Adele Gilbert would commit to marry a businessman at that time and then escaped the tracking of those people? But there were still some people who know where she is, such as the Williams, the Hills and the Fields.
	But the Williams were different from others. At that time, the William was also very powerful compared with the Gilberts. So there was no need to fight for myth ring. Being next door to the Moores, partly it was because Dan’s mother and Adele were old friends, so they protected her secretly.
	Until now, those people still haven't given up looking for the myth ring. Jack even supervises Adele all the time, trying to find out a clue of the myth ring from her.
	In the end, as no one knew the reason, he divorced Adele Gilbert. Since then, the Moores have been occupied by Celina and Mia.
	"Hooson probably comes to bother my mummy because of the myth ring." Ian considers about it carefully, and in this way it can explain why Hooson kidnapped his mummy.
	"Haven’t the secret ring been found yet? Is it in Jamie's hands?" Duke asks.
	"No, there is no myth ring in Mommy's hands. We haven't found it yet, but mommy is my grandmother's daughter. So those men will put their attention on mommy." Ian conceals the fact that the myth ring is in his hands because this matter is too important and he cannot take any risks.
	"We see. Ryan, let's go and find out if there are other clues." Bruce nods. He stands up and says to Dan. And Duke also stands up after him.
	Dan nods to hint that he knows their intention.
	After they leave, only Ian and Dan are left in the office.
	"Tell me. What do you want to say to me?" Dan pinches Ian's soft face. No wonder Jamie always likes to pinch Ian’s face, it feels really good.
	Ian looks up at Dan with a small face, looking serious, "Daddy, what Bunny says later might be ridiculous but Daddy must believe me."
	"Well, Daddy believes you." Dan nods without any hesitation. He knows that what Ian is going to say must be important.
	"That is, Mummy is not Jack's daughter. Mummy's biological father, Bunny’s grandfather, is Henry Lockwood. Mummy also has an elder brother, Chris Lockwood, who is a famous man in France."
	"Actually, before marrying Jack, my grandmother married grandfather. But no one knew it. Later, the Gilberts suffered something suddenly. My grandfather did not return because he was in France at that time. Then grandmother fled to the Moores with my mom in her abdomen, which was less than a month at that time. Grandmother married to Jack and gave birth to mummy. My grandfather told me that mummy's name is Jamie Lockwood. It is the name grandmother decided when she was pregnant with her, carrying her wish that my mummy would be carefree in the rest of her life.
Chapter 272 The myth ring
	Ian slowly tells the secret which is concealed for many years. But it is told only to Dan, so he doesn't have any worries.
	Dan listens to him very seriously. When he was young, he had seen Jamie’s mother. She was a very gentle and kind mother. She loved Jamie so much. Maybe he grew up with Jamie while seeing Adele treat Jamie well, so he always spoils Jamie as if she is one of his families.
	Like her mother, he wants to love her with all his efforts.
	"Grandma tried her best to divorce Jack but the only condition is to leave Jamie as a condition for taking the myth ring. For the sake of myth ring, Jack won’t harm mummy. And grandma agreed so. Who knows that after a few years she died..." Mentioning of these, Ian is sad.
	He often listens to mommy talking about grandma who is very gentle. Every time when she mentioned grandma, she really missed Adele.
	Dan's heart tightens. He looks at Ian and asks, "Because of what?"
	Jamie’s mother is only in her forties at the time, so why did she jump from a building suddenly?
	"Because of the so-called benefits." Ian's big eyes show a bit of hatred. If it’s not because of Jack, his grandmother would be alive happily now.
	For the myth ring, he really uses all kinds of means.
	_
	When Jamie wakes up again, it’s at night outside the window. The shadow of the tree reflects on the French window, which looks a little scary.
	The room is lit, so Jamie doesn’t feel scared. But there are still some worries about the current situation.
	She doesn’t know what those people want to do or why she is under arrest in this house. But she can’t sit still and wait for death any longer.
	After sleeping for a while, Jamie finds that the medicine’s effect in her body has been disappeared. It seems that it is correct not to eat the food they bring.
	She stands up and searches for something in the room. She isn’t sure if those people have micro-monitors in the room. If so, then she has to be careful when taking action.
	After looking around, she doesn't find a micro-monitor. With a prudent mind, she still doesn't dare to be too obvious. She walks to the door of the room and twists the lock.
	Unexpectedly, it is locked from the outside.
	The French windows are also locked, and they cannot be opened at all, except to see the outside scene.
	Who is it? Who kidnapped her so painstakingly but then just put her under house arrest?
	Jamie returns to the bed and sits down. The hair slips off her shoulders covers half of her face so that no one can see her expression.
	In a room in the villa, there is no light in the room and it is very dark. Through the projection on the huge screen on the wall, you can see that there is a figure on the sofa opposite. He stares at the figure in the screen casually.
	"What are you going to do next?" It is a voice of female. She lowers her voice, as if she’s afraid of disturbing the person on the sofa.
	"What about another person?" The man turns his head slightly. In the shadows, you can’t see his face clearly, but his temperament makes you feel so comfortable. 
Chapter 273 We can go on according to the original plan
	"He’s arrested in another room and is not awake yet," The female answers.
	"Well, we can go on according to the original plan. By the way, there is no need to add medicine in her meals or water. She can't run away." The man turns around and looks at Jamie's side face on the screen with a touch of tenderness and pity.
	In the next two days, Jamie doesn't see anyone except someone who takes food on time.
	The girl says to her that the host claims that the food is safe when she came in to give her the meal yesterday. So please don’t worry about it and enjoy the meals.
	Jamie is not surprised, because there are monitors in this room and all her actions must be under the control of those people.
	But in that person's tone, it doesn't seem that he wants to hurt her. Who is it? Why does he treat with great concern? For what?
	While eating, Jamie is thinking about it. She has no value. If there is, then it is ... the myth ring!
	Are those people for myth ring?
	But this seems to be unreasonable. The goal of those people is obviously Ryan. She accidentally met them. If not, she would not be taken away together.
	Damn it! It’s really a brain-mangling problem.
	Jamie angrily pokes the beef on the plate with a fork, regarding this as those people.
	Dan must have found her missing for a long time. But she hasn't been found yet, which means that it's really hard to find this place. She has to find a way to contact them.
	But... the only communication tool she carries is taken away by them. How can she contact Dan?
	A plan comes to her mind. Jamie puts down the knife and fork after the meal. She walks back and forth in the room, digesting the food in the stomach.
	Dan and others haven’t got any results for two days. They finally put their attention on city A. But with so many cities in country C, finding someone from so many cities is equal to find a tiny needle in the sea.
	"Dan, I have sent people to search in countries B and C and we have not yet found the location where Jamie is." Derek hangs up the phone and walks over to Dan. He lowers his head to report respectfully.
	Dan's hands have been clenched into fists. Two days, it has been taken two full days. But there is still no trace of Jamie and even no clue.
	His handsome face is full of tiredness, and his eyebrows are filled with great worries. There are red bloodstains in his eyes, and there are blue in his eye sockets. He hasn’t taken rest for two days and now he is sober because of a few beliefs.
	"Daddy, don't worry. Since that they took mummy away because of the myth ring, then mummy must be safe now." Ian walks over with a laptop and his hand is supporting the bottom of the laptop. His other hand works fast on the keyboard.
	Dan's eyes soften when he sees Ian. He rubs his small head and looks at the map on the screen. "What is this?"
	"Daddy, do you remember the necklace you send to mummy?" Ian zooms in on the map and points the mouse at the pattern of the necklace on the map.
	World?
	Dan's eyes narrow slightly and he nods, "I remember."
	"In addition to the unique and natural appearance of that necklace, the necklace is also equipped with a small GPS, which can be used in GPS positions. The reason why the stone is not polished or cut is because there is something in it, which is reserved by the original owner of the necklace. "Ian zooms in on the map a little more and his soft and cute face looks quite serious.
	If it isn’t Night.7 suddenly reminding of it and telling him, maybe they will waste more time looking for Jamie’s position.
	In fact, the necklace is not all natural but is composed of two parts. The GPS locator is sandwiched between the two parts, and the obsidian color is dark. So it is difficult to be discovered.
	Ian only feels that thanks to the man who comes up with such an idea to put a locator in the necklace. Maybe it is also for the purpose of protecting someone and he wants to find the position of someone at all times.
	"You know a lot." Dan's lips lightly raise and his big hand is rubbing Ian's head. His movement becomes careful and he narrows his eyes as if remembering something.
	"This is, this is what Night.7 tells me." Ian just smiles happily and feels delighted to be praised by his father.
	Dan doesn't speak again, but guess that the woman he met at that day must have a relationship with Ian. Since Ian doesn't intend to explain, he won’t force him.
	"Damn it... There is a signal blocker in that area and I can't find the specific position of mummy." Ian's little fingers tap hard on the keyboard a few times and there is no way to crack the signal of that blocker.
	This blocker is very strange, as if it is specially designed for him that he can't crack it.
	"Let me see." Dan frowns. He takes the laptop and enters a line of letters. Then more letters appear on the screen.
	Ian leans over to look at Dan while his eyes are shining. And in a moment, the position on the screen is displayed.
	"Daddy is so great." Ian's eyes are shining. Daddy's computer skill actually is so good that it is so easy for him to crack even Ian can’t do it.
	"Yes." Dan answers in a low voice, seeing through the position.
	It turns out that Jamie is not in any city but in the sea between City A and City D. There is a resident island on the sea, where all the residents are from City D. It’s a little remote and has strict security while the signal is difficult to penetrate through.
	In the past two days, they have put their attention on those cities. But they don’t expect that those people are more cunning that they actually hide her on an island.
	And it’s hidden so secretly that there is signal blocker.
	"Mommy is now in a villa on the island. Where is the villa?" Ian leans over, narrows his eyes and tries to write down the address on it.
	At that moment, the signal light suddenly disappears and even the map fades away.
	"What? Come on!" Ian can’t control himself and pats on the computer screen while having an angry expression.
	" Villa No. 27, Tung-Tree Road." Dan glanced at the address just a moment ago but he can remember it. He thinks it funny when he sees Ian's indignant look.
	Ian's eyes light up and he watches at Dan with more adoration, "Daddy, shall we go now?"
	"No, this action will be very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will even die for it. You can't take risks and should wait at home." Dan refuses Ian's proposal without hesitation and stands up.
	Ian's soft face suddenly has disappointment. He watches at Dan sorrowful. But then a cunning thought flashes across his big eyes, he nods obediently, seeing Dan leave with Derek.
Chapter 274: The elite of the elite
	A few minutes later, when Ian Moore ensures that Dan William has left the manor, he begins his action.
	"Night.7, let's go." Ian Moore begins to pack up his things into his backpack and carries it on his back. After doing all this, he calls Night.7 out.
	Night.7 is amused by the action of Ian Moore. “Bunny, if your daddy knows this, he will spank you.
	Ian Moore wrinkles his little nose and straightens his chest confidently, and says, "No, we will follow daddy secretly, thus he will not find out."
	-
	Dan William goes to the island of the citizen with Derek William. He even sends people of the training camp to approach the island from the sea secretly.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field also lead two teams of training camp. They run forward with the same speed as Dan William.
	But none of them thought that Dan William would use the trump card of training camp for Jamie Moore. In this way, their action must ruffle some feathers.
	Everyone in the training camp is the elite of the elite. They are all trained specially. No matter for their physique or competency, they can’t be picked out wrong.
	If this team was discharged, every member of them would be scrambled by all the other forces.
	So Dan William does all this secretly all these years. No one knows this except Bruce Hill and Duke Field.
	Neither does Jamie Moore.
	"Young master, the island is ahead." Derek William steers the helicopter. He says when he sees the island in front of him.
	Derek William is also a member of the training camp. He is the direct leader of all teams. He has outstanding ability and he is very loyal. Unlike other members of the training camp, he has been with Dan William since he was young. He has less training time than others, but he works harder than others, so he has today's status.
	"Stop 50 meters away from the island, and then we will dive." Dan William looks at the front. He presses his lips hardly, and a touch of soft appears in his eyesight.
	Jamie, don't be afraid, I will save you.
	-
	"Dan!" In the room, Jamie Moore, who is sleeping in the bed, sits up suddenly. Sweat drips down from her forehead. Her face is pale, and she looks very bad, as if she has had a nightmare.
	Jamie Moore doesn't close her eyes again. She dares not to think about the scene she had dreamed of. Even though it is a dream, she can feel the despair and pain of death.
	The manor is embraced by the fire. It seems that the fire want to burn everything. Standing outside the manor, she sees the figure of Dan William falling from the manor to the sea of fire below.
	It’s impossible! It’s impossible!
	This is absolutely impossible!
	Dan William is so strong. How could he fall into the fire? It's just a dream. It's just a dream. Nothing will happen!
	Jamie Moore tries all her effort to calm herself down. But she is in a panic, and her heart thumps uncontrollably hard.
	She doesn't know why she dreamed of this suddenly. But she can’t wait any longer. She can’t let Dan William approach here. Even though this is a dream, she can’t wait here any longer.
	She needs to find a way to get out!
	Jamie Moore is a little confused. She rubs her eyes, and then she looks at the room with her lips pursed.
	There is no sharp weapon in this room, and there are only a few exquisite porcelain vases in the room, and a mirror in the bathroom. If she breaks the vase here, she will disturb those people certainly. Thus Jamie Moore decides to find a way from that mirror.
	She pretends that she has a stomachache. Then she bows her back and walks into the bathroom, and then she closes the door.
	It's impossible for those people to install monitors in the bathroom to see her releasing or showering.
	In fact, it’s impossible for them to do this. But if the door of the bathroom is open, the monitors will take a picture of the side of the mirror in the bathroom. If there is nothing bad with the bathroom, the monitors will move away.
	It can be seen that those people haven't changed into hooligans.
	Jamie Moore looks at the mirror, and she wants to break the mirror with something. In fact, she has got a plan in her mind. Although this plan is dangerous, she can’t wait any longer. She can’t wait any longer.
	She breaks the corner of the mirror with the bottle of shower gel slightly. Thanks to the hard bottom of the bottle. After a while, she breaks up the corner of the mirror. She holds the breaks in her hand, and then she puts the gel back.
	Then she moves the bottle of the facial cleanser and perfume to block the missing corner of the mirror. She suddenly reminds of something when she sees the bottom of perfume. She chooses a small bottle of perfume, and then she holds it in her hand.
	After doing all this, she walks to the mirror, and then she picks the glass fragment in her hand. She bites her lips, and then she cuts the blood vessel on the wrist of the other hand.
	Red blood flows slowly along her white wrist, and the blood flows more and more. She sits on the cold floor. Still biting her lips, she watches the bleeding wrist.
	WTF. If she died for losing too much blood today, she would kill those people even if she would’ve become a ghost!
	If those people have been watching her in the monitor, they will surely find that she has been in the bathroom for such a long time. Thus they will send someone to see her. At that time, she will get the opportunity to implement her plan…
	-
	The two figures swim very fast in the sea. Because they are only 50 meters away from the shore, they reach the shore in a few minutes.
	"Please wait a moment, young master. It will take some time for us to get there on feet. We already have some brothers there. They are approaching the island now. Younger master, wait a minutes, and you can change your clothes before going there.” He stops Dan William’s step as he says.
	Derek William is right. There is still a long way to Nantong road. It will take at least 40 minutes to get there on feet.
	And he can't afford to waste a minute.
	In less than half a minute, an SUV stops in front of them. A man weaves to him from the car.
	After getting on the car, they set out towards villa 27, Nantong road.
	Different from the city, the environment of the island is quiet and clean, and even the air is better than the city.
	"Young master, they have arrived around the villa. Do we need to get into the villa and save Miss Moore?" Derek William receives the information from those people. Thus he asks Dan William.
	Dan William opens his eyes slightly, and his eyesight is very fierce. “Order them stand by in place. When I arrived there, I will make a decision. They should stay there to ensure the safety of Jamie Moore before I arrived.
	“Yes.”
	-
	People in the villa doesn’t know that other people have are lying in ambush. When the man returns to the monitoring room from the outside, he finds that Jamie Moore hasn’t yet come out of the bathroom.
	It's almost half an hour since she went into the bathroom.
	The man looks at the screen nervously. He waits a few minutes, but Jamie Moore doesn’t show herself out of the bathroom.
Chapter 275: Don't be stupid
	"Something is wrong." He wants to have a look, but he is stopped by a woman.
	"Don't be stupid. What if she sees you?” The woman blocks in front of him.
	"I don’t care about that. Anyway, she must be kept alright." He wants to push the woman away, but she stands still not to let him go.
	"The master will return in any minute. Do you want something bad happened now? You stay here. I'll go to have a look." Finished, she looks at him for a while, and turns away.
	Frustrated, he steps back, and t looks at the closed bathroom door. Then he sees that woman walk to the room. At the door, she knocks but receives no answer.
	No patience to wait, she kicks the door hardly. After several kicks, the door is open.
	Then the scene of the bathroom appears in the monitors.
	Jamie Moore lies in the blood that is still drifting from the wound on her wrist. On the cold white floor, it feeds the eye with shock.
	The woman, who stands at the door, is also shocked. She never expects that Jamie Moore would be so upset that she even cut her wrist and commit suicide!
	The man, who stands in front of the screen, holds his hand tightly. To refrain from his impulsion to rush to her rescue, he lowers his head and avoids the sight of Jamie Moore.
	He can’t rush to her. If he did, he would ruin everything.
	That woman immediately calls some people to help and she herself carries Jamie Moore from the blood to her breast, and gets out of the room.
	The wound is cut by Jamie Moore herself. She knows to avoid fatal hurt. Though it’s still bleeding, she still has her sense.
	When that woman carries her in her arms, she opens her eyes to see who is that.
	At the sight of the woman, her heart nearly stops. She can hardly believe it, so she got so anxious and right away shut her eyes.
	Anna Pork! It’s Anna Pork!
	The girl who defeated Bruce Hill the first time she met him! What’s more, she always calls her Sister Jamie. Anna Pork is the little sister of Hooson!
	Why is she here? Was it she that took her here?
	If yes, who asked her to do this? Hooson?
	Now it’s clear that there is something wrong with Hooson.
	Because Jamie Moore has lost a lot of blood, her mind is in a mess now. But she still tries all her efforts to keep herself awake.
	This is the only chance. If she can’t seize it, she will be over!
	She doesn’t know what Anna Pork and Hooson want to do, but it will not be a good thing.
	She always thinks that it’s strange when Hooson appears around her every time. Now she knows that it’s all premeditated!
	Anna’s strength is greater than Jamie Moore has thought. She carries Jamie Moore in her arms all the way to the garage and puts her into the car.
	Although they have doctors, they can't do blood transfusions here. Jamie Moore also knows this, otherwise, she will not cut her wrists so recklessly.
	She never does anything uncertain.
	But this time, it's a gamble——a gamble of life and death.
	If she doesn't bet this time, she can only wait for death. If she does bet, she can at least fight for a chance. If she doesn't try, she will never know whether she can do this.
	Fortunately, she wins the bet.
	The garage is an underground garage, so Anna Pork comes to the garbage directly from a room of the villa.
	The villa sits close to other ones. If they make a loud action, it will attract unnecessary attention. So Anna Pork dares not to take many people. Moreover, she is very capable with labor, while Jamie Moore is just a fail girl lack of physical strength. Thus she doesn’t pay much attention to her and takes her to the hospital alone.
	The camp members around the villa report this to Dan William, but no one knows that Jamie Moore is in the car.
	Jamie Moore was put on the back seat. Having her wrist dealt with first-aid measures, the bleeding is stopped. Besides the left hand she cut, she still has her right hand for action. The bottle of perfume she grabbed from the bathroom is hidden there.
	Anna Pork focuses on driving without noticing Jamie. She sits up immediately when she finds the chance. Then she sprays the perfume to Anna's eyes quickly.
	Anna Pork feels stinking in her eyes before she gets the sense. When she opens her eyes, everything is dark, and she can’t see anything. She feels so painful.
	"Ah..." Anna Pork cried, and then she realizes that she is driving. Thus she steps on the brake at once. At the same time, Jamie Moore opens the door and runs away.
	Anna Port wants to catch Jamie Moore, but she can’t see anything. Thus she grabs a bottle of water and gets out to wash her eyes.
	Jamie Moore has lost too much blood that she gasps after running for a few steps. But in order to get rid of Anna Moore, she needs to run forward.
	After running for a long time, she sees that Anna Pork almost catches up with her. She murmurs “Darn”, and runs forward quickly.
	Seeing that Anna Pork is getting closer and closer to her, Jamie Moore looks around, and hides herself in the shrub.
	Anna Pork doesn’t find that Jamie Moore has hided herself in the shrub, so she just runs ahead straightly.
	A few minutes later, Jamie Moore stands up straightly. She wipes the sweat on her forehead, and then pats her face to make her mind clearly.
	She can't fall down. She can't fall down at this moment. If Anna Pork couldn’t find her ahead, she will come back to seek her. She needs to leave here quickly.
	Shaking her head to clear her mind, Jamie Moore walks out of the shrub. But within a few steps, she faints suddenly.
	"Are you alright, Miss? Miss?" A soft voice of inquiry comes into Jamie Moore’s ears. But Jamie Moore can’t reply her. She is too dizzy now to get rid out the faint.
	Originally, Caro Jones comes here to see a friend. Unexpectedly, he comes across this kind of thing.
	Obviously, this woman cuts her wrist and she has lost a lot of blood. She is already in such a bad situation, and still runs outside? Maybe someone is after her.
	Troublesome. Should he help, or not?
	Caro Jones squats down, and then he pulls away the hair covering Jamie Moore's side face. He finds the delicate and beautiful face of Jamie Moore. This woman has a snowy skin and graceful hill-like eyebrows. Although her lips are pale, she looks so beautiful. He is amazed.
	She looks so familiar that he thinks they must have met before.
	"Since you have aroused my curiosity, I will just take you out of here." Caro Jones speaks with himself. Then he carries Jamie Moore in his arms and takes her to his Maserati.
	A few minutes after he leaves with Jamie Moore, Anna Pork finds there is something wrong. She has searched all around, but not a soul of her was found.
	"Damn!" She curses. And then she gives a call to Hooson.
	At this time, Dan William and Derek William have arrived at the 27 villa. But they don’t know that Jamie Moore has left.
	Dan William asks the the training camp to go into the villa one by one. Then he comes into the villa from the front door with Derek William.
Chapter 276: What has he got to be afraid of?
	"Who can make me lose so many subordinates at one time? It turns out to be Mr. William." As soon as Dan William and Derek William enter the villa, a black figure walks downstairs.
	It seems that he knows he needs to come out soon or later, thus he comes out immediately.
	As Dan William and Derek William expects, it’s Hooson.
	He is not different from the past. He is in a white casual suit, and wears a sunshine smile on his face. Hand in pockets, he goes downstairs step by step.
	Dan William knows it’s Hooson who catches Jamie Moore, so he is not at all surprised. Seeing Hooson walks to downstairs, Dan William is not afraid of those in black and with guns pointing at him. His face is as cool as ever, and his eyesight cold.
	"I'm not here to talk nonsense to you. I give you two choices. First, give Jamie Moore back immediately. Second, I will kill you, and then take her away. Choose one." Dan William says gracefully and calmly, as if he is ordering meal for today.
	Hooson smiles, and then he walks downstairs. Then he makes a gesture to let those people put down their guns. "Mr. William, why are you so anxious? Since you can find me here, you must be able to take Jamie Moore away. But do you think your ability can be compared with mine?"
	Dan William comes out before Hooson receives the call from Anna Pork, so now he doesn’t know Jamie Moore has fled.
	"You think too high of yourself.” Dan William says coldly. He stares at Hooson coldly, and finds that Hooson is full of self-confidence and arrogance.
	That means he must have some bigger ace in the hole.
	But before Dan William arrives here, Dan William knew that Hooson would hide Jamie Moore here and block the mobile signal of Jamie Moore. So he is definitely not an ordinary person. Now that he has come, what has he got to be afraid of?
	He would never give up taking Jamie Moore away from here.
	"Mr. William, you can have a try. I want to see if you are faster than the gun of my staff.” Hooson says with a smile. His smile is evil and light, and very cold.
	If Jamie Moore sees this, she will be shocked.
	How could he distinguish sunlight and indifference so thoroughly? They are totally two different person.
	The face of Dan William becomes dark. He clenches his hands tightly and draws up his mouth, staring at Hooson with a strong momentum, “You can have a try!”
	Suddenly the door opens, and Anna Pork walks in.
	Dan William turns his head a little and sees her, then he gives an eyes to Derek William.
	Derek William gets what he means right away. He approached Anna Pork in a flash and catches her before she can make any protest to protect herself. Derek William holds Anna Pork’s neck tightly. Once she is to move, he will kill her immediately!
	Anna Pork looks at Hooson with a hint of apology.
	The eyesight of Hooson becomes cold suddenly. He looks very bad, and he is very unhappy.
	"If you don't want your sister to die in such a way, you’d better hand Jamie Moore out immediately.” Derek William holds Anna Pork’s neck tighter than before as Dan Willian finishes his word. Anna Pork’s face become red, and it’s hard for her to breath.
	Hooson wants to save Anna Pork subconsciously. But he stops when he finds the uncomfortable appearance of Anna Pork. There is a hint of struggle in his eyes.
	"Young master, we don’t find Jamie Moore here. We even don’t find Jamie Moore in the inner sanctum of the villa!" One members of the training camp walks to Dan William, and then reports this to Dan William.
	Hooson opens his eyes widely, and then he looks at that man in a shocked way, and then he looks at Dan Wiliam.
	When does he send someone to search his villa? They even find the inner sanctum!
	It's impossible. If someone sneaks into the villa, he will notice this!
	"Are you sure?" Dan William's eyes are cold. He looks at that man coldly.
	"I’m sure, Miss Jamie Moore is not in the villa!" That team member shivers, and he stands straightly, and then he answers.
	"Ah!" Derek William holds Anna Pork’s neck tightly, thus Anna Pork can’t breathe well. She opens her mouth, and the color of her face changed into the color of pork liver. She tries all her efforts to get rid of Derek William’s hand.
	"Anna!" Hooson wants to save Anna Pork, but he is stopped by a team member. And the man, who points the gun at Dan William, has fallen to the ground. There is only a red blood mark on his neck.
	"I'll give you only one chance. Where's Jamie Moore?" Dan William takes out a military knife, and then he puts the knife on Hooson’s face.
	His smile is cold and cool, which makes people feel scared.
	No one will doubt that he will cut Hooson's face with this knife.
	Hooson holds his hand tightly. He struggles for a while, and he is a little helpless.
	"Anna Pork just takes Jamie Moore to the hospital.”
	"Which hospital?" Dan William asks, and he doesn’t loosen the knife in his hand.
	Anna Pork looks at the knife beside her face. Hearing Hooson’s words, Anna Pork says immediately, “She is in the Central Hospital, I send her there myself!”
	Dan William smiles coldly. She looks at Anna Pork as if she is an idiot. Then he makes a blood mark on her face. His voice is very cold, "Are you sure?"
	"Wait! Anna sends Jamie Moore to the hospital, but she runs in the middle of the way!" Seeing that Dan William makes a blood mark on Anna’s face, Hooson tells the truth to Dan William immediately.
	Run?
	Dan William relieves slightly. Then he loosens the knife on Anna Pork’s face, but then he suddenly reminds of something, and his eyes are full of chill.
	"Why do you send Jamie Moore to the hospital?"
	Hooson and Anna Pork feels the creeps.
	It’s terrible. He forgets this. The reason that they send Jamie Moore to the hospital is because she cuts her wrist and loses too much blood.
	Anna Pork dares not to tell the truth to Dan William. She stays very close with Dan William. She could feel the cold air around this man, which could almost freeze other people.
	Although they don’t do this to Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore hurts herself for this.
	"She cuts her wrists." Hooson's eyes show some pain in him. But she hides herself well, and no one could notice it without easily.
	He never expected that Jamie Moore would cut her wrist.
	He doesn't want to force her into this situation, but he must do this.
	Dan William’s eyes are full of fierce, and the air around him is very cold. However, he raises a smile on the corner of his mouth, which makes other people feel that he is inaccessible.
	When he smiles, his smile is soft, cool and light. But his eyes are findifferent, and his smile very cold,like the the glacier. Even though he is smiling, the coldness around him can’t be ignored.
Chapter 277: She Would Rather Die
	"Which hand?" Dan William says in a low voice. He loosens the knife on Hooson’s face, but Derek William still holds Anna Pork’s neck tightly.
	Anna Pork looks at him with fear, and swallows saliva unconsciously, "Left, left hand..."
	Every girl is very concerned about her face, and she is no exception. If her face is destroyed, she will spend the rest of her life with a disfigured face.
	She would rather die than be scarred.
	When Anna Pork finishes her words, Dan William holds the knife in his hand, and cuts her hands in a flash that Hooson sees only another blood mark on the ground.
	What’s more, two blood marks appear onher left and right wrists of. The blood flows down her wrists.
	"Anna!" Hooson narrows his eyes, and he wants to bring Anna to his side. At this time, Derek William loosens his hand, thus Anna Pork falls down on Hooson’s arms.
	Anna Pork’s face is very pale, and the blood still flows from her wrist. What’s more, she can’t raise her hand, and she feels that her hand has broken.
	"Jamie Moore hurts her left hand, so I'll cut both hands of hers for compensating. You’d better pray that Jamie Moore is OK, or I'll kill you!" Dan William looks coldly at Hooson, who is bandaging up for Anna Pork. Then he hands the knife to Derek William and folds his arms before his breast.
	Hooson observes the cuts on Anna’s hands as he bandages up for Anna Pork. He doesn’t expects that Dan William would be so relentless. He has cut off her veins. It's impossible for her to lift heavy things in the future.
	This man is so cruel for Jamie Moore!
	"Do you think you can find Jamie Moore now?" Hooson bandages up for Anna Pork, and then he holds Anna in his arms, and then he says in a fierce way.
	Dan William doesn’t answer his question, and he looks at him.
	"When we find Jamie Moore cuts her wrists, half an hour has passed. At this time, she has lost too much blood. Even if she gets rid of us, she could not go far. Maybe she has died somewhere." He walks to the sides as he says softly.
	When Dan William hears that Jamie Moore has lost too much blood, his hearts jumps heavily, and then his eyes become scarlet.
	A fog suddenly rises on the ground before Dan William does something. Then Hooson runs toward the fog with Anna Pork in his arms, and he runs quickly.
	Derek William wants to catch them, but he is stopped by Dan William. He looks at the fog, and then he presses his lips, “No need to catch them. Burn here now."
	"Yes."
	A few minutes later, the villa is on fire, and then the whole villa is submerged in the sea of fire. The fire is burning recklessly, and it’s dazzling.
	A figure jumps down from the second floor of the villa and falls into the sea of fire.
	The neighbors around the villa find something wrong after the fire burns for several minutes. When they go out to see it, the villa is completely submerged in the fire. They immediately call the police.
	Dan William knows the strict security here, so these fires will spread so fast. It only takes a few minutes to burn everything up.
	"Call out the S-level team, and let them search Jamie secretly. We must find Jamie Moore!” Dan William stands not far from the villas. He looks at the sea of fire, and then he orders coldly.
	Hearing the order of Dan William, the training camp finally comes into the eyes of other people.
	-
	In the forest near the sea to the south of the island, there is a secluded area. Few people step on it, but the environment is quiet and natural. No one would expect that someone will live here.
	A white independent villa stands in the green forest, which looks very secret. There are a lot of French parasol plants beside the main road of the front gate of the villa. The leaves fall on the path, and it looks very beautiful.
	The whole villa is full of a fragrance of the seven brocade glutinous rice porridge. One will have a big appetite as long as he smells the fragrance. It must be a girl with such dexterity.
	In fact, it’s a boy…
	Caro Jones puts one of his hands in his pocket, and he holds the tray with another hand. He goes upstairs along the white wooden stairs with a languid look.
	When he walks to the room at the end of the corridor, he pushes the door and walks in. this room has a good lighting, and this room faces the coast of the island. Although this room is covered by green trees, he could see the waves of the sea. The cold wind blows into the room, thus the room is very cold.
	He walks to Jamie Moore, who is lying on the white bed. She has not woken up yet. He does not take her to the hospital in order to avoid an unnecessary trouble. Thus he takes her here.
	Fortunately, although he always lives in a wealthy life, and he never does housework, his cooking skill is very good. He inherits his mother's advantages.
	"Aren’t you getting up?” Caro Jones puts the tray aside. He stares at the sleeping face of Jamie Moore for a while, and then he pats Jamie Moore’s face, “Hey, wake up, are you dead?"
	Jamie Moore doesn’t have any reaction. She is in a deep sleep. Partly because she doesn’t have a good rest these days, and partly because she loses too much blood and she is still in a coma.
	"If you want to die, please tell me. I'll throw you out. Don't die here." Caro Jones murmurs. At that time, his brain must have become addled. Otherwise, how could he bring such a trouble home?
	Although this woman is very beautiful, it’s useless. Otherwise, if something bad happens to her, he will feel guilty.
	There are no servants or family or friends here except him. So he must take care of Jamie Moore by himself.
	Jamie Moore hasn’t wake up when one night has passed. Caro Jones doesn’t wait for her. He puts the porridge on the head of the bed, and then drives away in his Maserati.
	He goes to that villa. The villa is totally destroyed. Police has made a cordon around the villa. Now it’s almost early morning, so there is no one around the villa.
	"Ha. Who has such a strong ability? He even burns his house. It’s so good.” Caro Jones whistles, and then he smiles wildly. He doesn't stay for a long time.
	Jamie Moore wakes up the next evening. She feels much better after having a rest for almost a day. But she is still weak.
	She looks at the bandaged wrist, and sighs. Then she finds something wrong. Thus she looks up and looks around.
	"Where is this?"
	Where is she now? Hass she been taken back by Anna Pork?
	When Jamie Moore thinks of this things, the door is opened from outside. Then a tall figure walks into the room.
	Seeing Jamie Moore wakes up, Caro Jones raises his eyebrow. Then he says with some concern, "Did you have a nice sleep?"
	"Who are you?" Jamie Moore looks at him doubtfully. The voice of the man is very familiar. It seems that she has heard this voice before.
	"My name is Caro Jones, Carol minus the l .” He glances at Jamie Moore gently. Then he picks the porcelain bowl in the tray and stirs the porridge with the spoon.
	Caro Jones.
	Jamie Moore reads this name in her heart. Then she suddenly reminds that she faints when Anna Pork chases her. She heard his voice before she faints. So it’s him who saved her life.
Chapter 278: Meeting a good man
	"Thank you for saving me." Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she smiles. Her eyesight are very soft. Because she is still weak, her face is pale, but she still looks beautiful.
	Caro Jones is shocked for a few minutes when he sees the sweet smile of Jamie Moore. Then he says, “I think you are very beautiful, thus I save you.”
	Jamie Moore chokes for a while. She should thank the beautiful face of herself.
	"Come on, this is the first time for me to make something for others. You've earned it." Caro Jones hands the porcelain bowl to Jamie Moore. Because he has stirred the porridge with the spoon, thus the temperature of the porcelain bowl is just moderate, and it’s not hot.
	Jamie Moore smiles. It seems that she has met a good man.
	"By the way, you haven't told me your name yet." Seeing that Jamie Moore eats porridge, Caro Jones sits beside the bed, and just looks at her, and then he asks her some questions.
	"My name is Jamie Moore, ramie started with J." Jamie Moore answers.
	Hearing this, Caro Jones smiles unconsciously and says, "I can read. I don't need you to tell me which word it is."
	But what he thinks in his heart is that it’s Jamie Moore, who is the top designer of FS. What’s more, she is wel-known in country C recently. Even some people on the island know her.
	This is also the reason that Caro Jones takes her back.
	Otherwise, he is a cold person, and he will never do such thing.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t answer him. She lowers her head to eat porridge. Although this man speaks in an arrogant way, this is his nature, and he has no malice. In addition, he saved her life. Of course, Jamie Moore would repay him.
	"Do you have a mobile or telephone? Can I make a call?" Jamie Moore reminds that Dan William may still be looking for her. She wants to contact Dan William to pick her up.
	It's almost five days since she is arrested. Ian Moore must worry about her very much.
	Now Ian Moore is looking for her on the island with Night.7.
	The eyesight of Caro Jones dodges, and he avoids the inquiring eyes of Jamie Moore, and then he says proudly, “The signal here is poor, and the mobile phone is just for decoration."
	Jamie Moore is disappointed. How can she contact Dan William in such way?
	"Where are we?"
	Caro Jones is a little confused, but he still explains patiently, “This is a residential island in the sea area between City A and City D. Don't you know?"
	Is it?
	God, how far is it from City A!
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She hasn’t come to this place before, but she has heard this place. This place is close to City D, but it’s far from City A. It will take three days at least to return back to City A with a boat.
	What’s more, she's seasick.
	"You are not a native, are you? How did you come to this place?" Caro Jones looks aside, and then he asks doubtfully.
	When Jamie Moore sees the girl who delivers dinner to her in the villa of Anna Pork at the first time, she knows that villa is not in City A from the words of this girl. Caro Jones has lived here for nineteen years, and she could know the identity of Jamie Moore from her appearance alone.
	"That's right. I come from City A. I was caught here by someone." She frowns and then she says with depression.Jamie Moore puts the empty porcelain bowl on the head of the bed.
	Five days has passed. She misses Dan William and Ian Moore.
	" You were kidnapped here? Are you kidding me? The public security here is always very good. Such things will never happen!" Caro Jones is excited when he hears the words of Jamie Moore. He stands up to refute her words.
	Jamie Moore blinks her eyes. She is a little shocked when she sees the excited look of Caro Jones. It seems that he protects here well. He is ignited by the words of her.
	"Look at me. Am I like a liar? And no matter how good the security is, can you guarantee that there is no accident?" Jamie Moore shakes her head and chuckles. Everything is not absolute. Even though the public security is good, some people does something bad here.
	Caro Jones presses his lips. He keeps silent for a while. Jamie Moore is right. If the public security is really good, she will not be caught to here. What’s more, she is brought in from outside.
	It must be an internal problem in them.
	"The jurisdiction over the security of our island is taken over by a man named Hooson not long ago, and this is a problem of this man probably." Caro Jones says with dissatisfaction.
	Hooson?
	Jamie Moore looks at Caro Jones in surprise. Does he mean Hooson? Hooson is actually in charge of public security on this island!
	No wonder that he could transfer her from City A here in such a short time. So many days have passed, but Dan William still doesn’t find her. Unexpectedly, Hooson has such a magical identity.
	"Do you know who kidnapped me this time?" Jamie Moore leans back against the soft pillow. Now she is relaxed, and her nerves are not so tight.
	"Who?" Caro Jones asks curiously.
	"Hooson." Jamie Moore replies.
	Caro Jones looks at her with wide eyes. Now he looks more serious than before. Then he looks at Jamie Moore in a gloat way, “Do you mean it’s Hooson who kidnapped you?”
	"Yes, I see his sister—Anna Pork—before I run away. It’s her who was then after me." Jamie Moore nods. She thinks Caro Jones is too excited. Does he know Hooson?
	"Do you know him?" she asks.
	"I don’t want to know him!" Caro Jones says in a disdainful way, "It should be said that I know him…I don’t know where this man comes from. Then my father gives the jurisdiction of public security here to him, which reduces everyone's IQ."
	"Your father?" Jamie Moore raises her eyebrows. It sounds that Caro Jones’s father has a big official position.
	Well…Does he mean that his father is the owner of the island?
	Caro Jones snorts, “Yes, My father is the owner of the island—Kevin Jones.”
	Kevin Jones? Jamie Moore’s face lit. It sounds interesting. The name of father is Kevin Jones, and the name of the son is Caro Jones. If we put the name of the son and father together, it's a plant name (their Chinese name characters).
	"Your father must value you." Otherwise, he would not give you such a corresponding name.
	Caro Jones shakes his head sadly, "Hum! If one father loves his son, will he still have bastard outside?
	"Bastard?" Jamie Moore looks at him in surprise. She thinks thmeaning reference of this word.
	"Don't ask so much." He wants to get off this question. Then he looks up and looks at Jamie Moore, “Hey, I save your life. Do you want to repay me?"
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. The mind of this boy jumps so quickly, and then she nods, “Yes.”
	She has probably guessed the bastard from the dialogue between them.
	So who is Anna Pork? She is Hooson’s sister. Is Anna Pork also a child of his father?
	"You should go to a party with me tonight, and I'll try to get you in touch with your family after that." Caro Jones looks at Jamie Moore with his beautiful eyes. And there is a hint of mischief in his eyes.
Chapter 279: Who Do You Think You Are?
	"Why don't you say this earlier? OK, I'll go with you." Jamie Moore relieves when she hears Caro Jones��s word. She rolls her eyes at Caro Jones. If he says this early, everything would be OK. It almost kills all her brain cells to get an idea to leave here.
	He smiles, ��Do you mean this is my fault? Tonight, you don��t have to do anything. You can listen to my arrangement."
	"I should listen to your words. Who are you? It��s true that you save my life, but you are so arrogant. Don't pretend to be a master." It seems that this child is very young, but he is so arrogant. Thus Jamie Moore wants to educate him.
	It's probably that no one has educated him like this before. Thus Caro Jones doesn��t say anything more.
	Jamie Moore smiles in her heart. Hum, I even give a birth to a child. Am I afraid of you?
	-
	Ian Moore stands not far away from the forest near the sea, and he has found the exact position of Jamie Moore. Although there is a shield in this island, fortunately, it's not aimed at him, so it's easy for him to crack it.
	Ian More takes out his phone, and he is ready to give a phone to Dan William, and then he hears the voice of Night.7, ��Bunny, is that your mother?��
	Night 7 says as she points at the Maserati coming out of the forest. And then she hands the telescope to Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore picks the telescope in his hand. It��s true that that woman is his mother. But why is she in a off-the-shoulder dress? Why is she with such a handsome man?
	Hum...how could mommy find such a young and handsome man so quickly?
	"Night.7, after the car now!�� Ian Moor puts down his telescope. He points at the Maserati where Jamie Moore is in. No one could take his mother away!
	Night.7 is embarrassed. How could Bunny talk to her in such a tone of ordering. It seems that she is several years younger than him.
	The car of Night.7 follows Maserati, but she follows in a certain distance. Ian Moore knows the exact location of Jamie Moore, thus he is not worried that Jamie Moore will be missed.
	"Ian Moore, wait a minute. There are our people here. I'll find the information for you." Night.7 picks the computer in her hands as she says. She skims the text on the screen, "Today is the 45 year old birthday party of Kevin Jones. He invites many important people to the party. If we want to join them, we must have an invitation letter now.
	"Do I need to make a fake one?" Ian Moore looks at Night.7, and then he blinks his big eyes.
	Seeing the loving face of Ian Moore, Night.7 reaches out his hand and pinches Ian Moore's soft face. "Let��s go, and I will take you to enter the room through the front door. But now we need to change our clothes."
	Ian Moore is satisfied with this. He just presses his lips. Since she could take him to the party, he doesn��t care about her words..
	In the villa, the banquet is ready. As long as all guests come, the banquet will start.
	Jamie Moore walks into the party with Caro Jones. He has met the villa of Dan William. Thus she is not surprised when she sees the magnificent villa here. It can��t just be said that Kevin Jones knows how to enjoy himself.
	Every piece of furniture and ornament is very good. It's gorgeous and exquisite. Only such word could describe this.
	It's gorgeous and exquisite.
	Compared with here, Caro Jones's villa is also very beautiful. But his life is not so dissipated, and his villa is not so luxurious. But his villa has a feeling of home.
	Compared with here, the villa of Caro Jones is like a place where people live. Even though the place is very beautiful, one can��t bring them away if he dies, and it will bring a visual burden.
	"Welcome back, young master." A middle-aged man, who seems to be a housekeeper, leads several maids to say hello to Caro Jones.
	"Well, I'll come to have a look and I will leave here soon." Caro Jones replies casually. He is not happy at all, instead, he is very cold.
	The housekeeper is in a hurry. Then he says, ��Younger master, you can��t do this. Although the master doesn't say anything, he is worried about you. It's the master's birthday today. Anyway, you need to stay here today. Am I right?"
	Hearing the words of housekeeper, Caro Jones looks at the housekeeper angrily, ��You mean filial piety? He has another child, am I right? I am not an important people for him...Oh, it��s terrible!"
	He feels pain in his head before he finishes his word. He stares at Jamie Moore, ��What are you doing?��
	Jamie Moore glances at him lightly. Then she looks at Caro Jones with warning eyes, ��Even though he has another child, he is still your father. How could you talk about him this way?"
	"It's up to you! Who do you think you are!" Caro Jones rubs the back of his head. It��s so terrible! And his whole good image has been destroyed.
	How could he save such a strong girl? Is it not late to throw her away now?
	��Ah.�� He raises his voice, and the speed of the transition is amazing.
	Because Jamie Moore hits his brain again.
	She doesn��t like this kind of ignorant child, and she likes to teach this kind of child.
	She has a father, but she can��t visit him, and she can only miss him. Now his father is still alive and his father even stands in front of him, why does he complain about this?
	He is asking for trouble!
	The eyes of the housekeeper become bright, and he looks at Jamie Moore politely, and then he ask, ��Who is this lady?"
	This woman dares to beat their cynical young master, and the young master hasn't fought back yet. Maybe he can start from her!
	Jamie Moore withdraws the fierce expression on her face, and then she turns to look at the housekeeper with a smile. She nods at the housekeeper politely, ��Hello, my name is Jamie Moore, and I am Caro Jones��s partner tonight.
	Partner? The eyes of the housekeeper become brighter. It��s interesting!
	"Hello, Miss Moore. I'm the housekeeper of this family. My surname is Swift." The housekeeper looks at her excitedly. "Miss Moore, it��s your first time to come here. Why don't you let the young master show you around and get familiar with the environment?"
	"There is nothing to visit. I'll leave soon anyway." Caro Jones is very unhappy with the housekeeper's attitude. He is the young master.. What is he to please an irrelevant woman?
	The housekeeper ignores the eyesight of Caro Jones, and he just looks at Jamie Moore with a smile.
	Originally, Jamie Moore wants to refuse the housekeeper��s suggestion. After all, it was someone else's house. There is nothing for her to visit. But she changes her mind when she hears the words of Caro Jones.
	"I��d like tol." She nods with a smile. She smiles happily, as if there is light in her eyes.
	So terrible!
	Caro Jones is not in a good mood. Thus he takes Jamie Moore to visit the Jones Family unhappily.
	"The housekeeper's menopause comes early than others. I know his real mind. Hum."
	Jamie Moore listens to the words of Caro Jones as she enjoys the surrounding scenery. She rolls at Caro Jones. From the hall to here, he has been spoken such words for five minutes.
	
Chapter 280: Influenced by what he constantly sees and hears.
	He is really a little child. There is no feud between family members.
	The villa of the Jones Family is very big, and there are many trees in the villa, which gives people a feeling of being close to nature.
	It's no wonder that Caro Jones lives in a place like the forest. It seems that he has been influenced by what he constantly sees and hears since childhood.
	There are many sycamore trees in the courtyard. The branches and leaves of them are luxuriant and green, full of life.
	The eyes of Caro Jones become bright when he sees a small sycamore trees. He pulls Jamie Moore to that tree, and then he takes a small shovel from behind the tree to dig the soil under the tree.
	"What are you hiding here?" Jamie Moore is very familiar with this scene, and it seems that she has met this scene.
	Back to when?
	The scene gradually comes to her mind. When she was a child, she wasnot good at math. If not for Dan William to make up the key points for her lessons, she would be the last in her class.
	Once she got less than 30 points in the exam, and she dared not to show it to Dan William. Her mother never saw the exam paper, because Dan William would look at Jamie Moore, and she believed in Dan William.
	At that time, she didn��t wait for Dan William, but went home alone. She meant to destroys the exam paper before Dan William would it.
	She dared not to hides the exam paper in the Moore Family. If mother and other maids saw it, she would be embarrassed.
	Thus she hid the exam paper in the William Family. But she didn��t know which place is the safest one. Thus she gets a good idea. She takes a small shovel from the Moore Family house, and digs a hole under a tree planted in the courtyard of the William Family, and then she hides the exam paper in that hole.
	She hides the exam paper carefully, and she even looks back from time to time. She is afraid that Dan William would appear suddenly. She murmurs in her heart, and she thinks she could cheat Dan William in such a way.
	But when she sees Dan William brings the chestnut cake to her, she suddenly loses her mind. So when Dan William asks her where the exam paper is, she tells him--I hide it under the tree. I hide it deeply. Am I smart?"
	Jamie Moore could not help but to cover her face when she reminds how stupid she was. She even tells him where she hides the exam paper. Sure enough, one could know other people��s intelligence from childhood.
	Dan William likes to make jokes with her since she is a child. And now she even jumps into the hole that dug by herself.
	After that, Jamie Moore is spanked inevitably again. She cried as she puts the chestnut cake into her mouth. She finishes the test paper with tears in her eyes before going to sleep.
	Now she thinks this scene is very funny.
	She is such a worthless girl. She just listens to Dan William��s words for a few chestnut cakes.
	"Exam papers." Caro Jones answers her as he digs the soil away.
	The eyes of Jamie Moore become bright. He is as smart as her. He also hides the exam paper under the tree!
	"Do you also hide your exam paper here?�� Jamie Moore is interest about this, thus she squats down to see his action. Then she sees an iron box corner appeared in the soil.
	Caro Jones pulls the mud around the iron box away, and then he pulls that iron box out. It��s tight since long time has passed. He sits on the ground as he pulls the iron box out. Then he opens the box.
	There are many exam papers in the iron box. But the grade zero on the exam paper is very conspicuous.
	Hahaha!
	Jamie Moore burst out. Although she always gets 20 points in the examination, she never gets zero points.
	Caro Jones is so strange. How could he get zero points for every subject. How impeccable he was on that.
	"Have you also did this?�� Caro Jones looks at Jamie Moore.
	"I have done this once, but someone find my action.�� Jamie Moore��s eyes are full of a touch of tenderness. She looks at the exam paper, as if she is in the past now.
	"You are so unlucky. I've never been found." Caro Jones says triumphantly, ��They are very precious to me.��
	Jamie Moore looks at the side face of Caro Jones. She raises her eyes, and her eyes are full of nostalgia.
	"You still love your father, don't you?" She asks.
	Caro Jones answers, "Yes, my mother died very early. I love my father very much. But that man betrays my mother so many years ago, and he even has an affair with other women outside!
	Jamie Moore listens to her words quietly. No one could bear this kind of thing.
	"Even if they have done paternity test, I still don't believe it. He will never be my brother!" Caro Jones says. He is a little angry, ��As long as I am alive one day, he could not enter the door of the Jones Family!��
	Jamie Moore frowns, ��How do you know that he is not your brother?��
	The paternity test is true. Maybe Caro Jones can't accept this fact.
	But she is surprised when she knows Hooson is another son of the Jones Family.
	Jamie Moore has a bad feeling. This thing is not so simple.
	Caro Jones snorts, ��Everything can be fake, am I right?��
	"Why did he do it?" Jamie Moore looks at him with a beautiful eyebrow. Jamie Moore doesn��t know why he is so determined.
	"That Hooson is not like my father at all, and his heart is dark. Otherwise, why did he kidnap you?�� Caro Jones throws the question to Jamie Moore. He doesn��t like Hooson. One reason is that he is a bastard, and another reason is that his heart is dark.
	Jamie Moore doesn��t deny the question of Caro Jones.
	"He's dangerous. He must be on for the inheritance of the island." Caro Jones says.
	Jamie Moore is a little shocked, ��What are you going to do?" Jamie Moore asks when she buries the iron box, and then she claps the earth on his hands.
	"If I told you, can you help me?" Caro Jones says carelessly, "You should help me tonight, and you can leave other things alone."
	Jamie Moore smiles, ��You look down on women. It��s more convenient for woman to do a lot of things.��
	Caro Jones wants to refute Jamie Moore��s word. But he stops when he sees the housekeeper walking toward them.
	"Young master, Miss Moore, our elder master asked to see you please." The housekeeper says.
	Jamie Moore glances at Caro Jones. Sure enough, this child is so duplicative, and the joy on his face is so obvious.
	When they return back to the hall, the cake has been cut. Kevin says sorry to people around him when he sees Jamie Moore and Caro Jones. And then he walks toward them.
	Caro Jones stops walking forward, and then he looks at other place.
	"Bay guy, I ask you to come back. Why don't you come back?" Kevin slaps on the head of Caro Jones after finishing his words.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Sure enough, they are father and son, and they have such a similar personality!
	Caro Jones covers his brain, and he stares at Kevin Jones, ��Dead old man! Why do you hit me!"
	"I'm your father. What's wrong with my action?" Kevin slaps his head several times again as he says, ��I do as I like to you. What��s wrong with this?��
	"If you continue to beat me, I will go now!�� Caro Jones says in a threatening way.
	Kevin Jones beats Caro Jones again after hearing the words of Caro Jones.
	
Chapter 281: Who is this lady?
	Kevin Jones withdraws his hand, and then he looks at Jamie Moore, ��Who is this lady?��
	"Hello, uncle Jones. My name is Jamie Moore. I'm Caro Jones��s friend." Jamie Moore smiles, and then she shakes hand with Kevin Jones politely.
	"Hello, Miss Moore." Kevin nods. He wants to say something to Jamie Moore, and then he sees Caro Jones looking at him unhappily, and Caro Jones just blocks his sight.
	Then Caro Jones says, ��Jamie Moore is my friend. Do you have any questions for her?"
	Kevin Jones looks very serious, ��Bad guy, don��t I have the opportunity to talk with her?��
	"Dad." A clear voice sounds behind them, which attracts several people's eyesight.
	Hooson wears a black suit, and he stands not far away from them.
	He looks at Jamie Moore for a few seconds, as if he doesn��t know Jamie Moore.
	The heaviness in Jamie Moore��s heart is deeper. She has been confused by his appearance before.
	But she doesn��t understand why does Hooson kidnap Ryan Jack and her.
	Besides, Ryan Jack is still in his hands. She has to find a way to save him.
	Caro Jones sneers when he sees the good spirit of Hooson and his father. His eyes get very cold. ��Hypocrites.��
	"Caro Jones, give me a favor." Jamie Moore turns his head and says in Caro Jones��s ear.
	Caro Jones hides uneasily.
	"What?"
	"I will leave alone."
	Caro Jones looks at her strangely, ��Are you crazy? If Hooson kidnaps you again, I will not save you again."
	"Don't worry, he dares not make trouble with me here."
	He dares not to make trouble with her in public.
	Caro Jones stares at her, ��You can do it according to your heart.
	Caro Jones stays away from her as he finishes his words. Then Jamie Moore walks to the backyard alone.
	��Jamie.��
	The voice of Hooson sounds behind Jamie Moore. His voice is the same as before, but Jamie Moore hates this voice most.
	She turns to look at him. Now he looks like Dan William, ��Mr. Hooson, I am not familiar with you.��
	Hooson takes a step back. It seems that he is sad, ��How can you say that? What did I do?"
	"Hooson!" Jamie Moore stops him without any hesitation, "I don't want to hear your voice. What do you want to do? What can I do for you to let go of Ryan Jack?"
	Hooson withdraws the original expression on his face, and there is an evil smile on the corner of his mouth.
	"Don��t you know the fact. When Dan William burns the villa, Ryan Jack is in the villa, so...�� Hooson stops his words here.
	The heart of Jamie Moore jumps heavily, and the she looks at Hooson in a shocked way, "You're lying! It's impossible for Dan William to do such a thing. Don't try to break the relationship between us!"
	"You could see the news first, and then you will know if I'm lying." Hooson says in a confident way.
	Jamie Moore is a little flustered when she sees Hooson says in such a confident way.
	Hooson finds Jamie Moore in a panic immediately. Thus he catches her wrist immediately. He pulls her to the front of him, "I lied to you. He's not dead, but..."
	"What?" Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she looks at Hooson warily.
	"You replace him. Do you agree with this?�� Hooson says with a smile.
	"Me? You can��t get anything good from me.��
	Except the myth ring.
	But she will never give the myth ring to him.
	"You have." Hooson raises Jamie Moore��s chin, and then he whispers in her ear.
	Jamie Moore turns aside, and she gets rid of his control. She hates the touch from Hooson!
	Hooson takes a few steps back after seeing Jamie Moore��s action. But he doesn't let go of her hand.
	"Well, I promise you." Jamie Moore answers directly.
	Ryan Jack has saved her life, and she must pay for this.
	Now Hooson is shocked. He looks at Jamie Moore in a surprise way, ��Are you serious? Is Ryan Jack so important to you? "
	Jamie Moore even sees the surprise in his eyes.
	"I'm sure. If you let him go, I'll go with you."
	If she goes with him at this time, it's not so easy to escape him.
	Dan, Dan. Your Jamie Moore is about to be abducted by him...
	Dan William signs. She hasn��t met him for several days. It seems that she misses him so much.
	"Don't worry, I'm not a liar. Come with me." Hooson wears a confident smile on his face. He holds her wrist tightly, and he is ready to take her away from here.
	"You..." Jamie Moore looks at him. She wants to say something, but she is stopped by the sound of the gun.
	A bullet lands at the feet of Hooson, blocking his step.
	Jamie Moore��s heart jumps heavily. That man does this intentionally!
	Jamie Moore looks up, but Hooson pulls Jamie Moore to the behind of her. He blocks her eyesight with his tall figure.
	"Let her go." A figure jumps down from the second floor and then walks towards them.
	Hooson narrows his eyes after he sees the man. ��Mr. William, you come so timely.
	"Thanks to your stubbornness." Dan William smiles coldly, and then he looks at the figure behind Hooson.
	Dan William? Hearing his voice, Jamie Moore wants to come out, but Hooson blocks her tightly.
	Then Hooson says, ��Mr. William, have you checked carefully when you burn the villa? Are you sure there is no one left?��
	"What do you mean?" Dan William narrows his eyes, and asks.
	Hooson knows that Dan William could kill him right now. But he doesn��t do this. The only reason is Jamie Moore.
	He is not afraid of this since he knows his weakness.
	"Why does Mr. William ask me? You know the truth best." Hooson doesn��t answer Dan William��s question. Instead, he asks such sharp question.
	"Do you want to break the relationship between us? It's no use for me." Dan William answers.
	Jamie Moore is embarrassed. Why does Hooson use the same skill twice? She opens her mouth and bites on Hooson's hand. She runs toward the direction of Dan William when Hooson loosens his hand.
	Hooson is shocked when he finds the small figure runs toward the arm of Dan William. There is a deep bite mark on the back of his hand.
	This woman is so fierce.
	"Dan William!" She is not afraid of anything since Dan William is beside her.
	Jamie Moore runs into the arms of Dan William. His arms are warm and wide, which makes her feel safe.
	Dan William smiles, and then he hugs the small body of Jamie Moore tightly. He misses her so much.
	Dan William looks at Hooson, and then he presses his lips, ��If we stay so close with each other, some people will be hurt and jealous. What do you think?��
	Jamie Moore hums. It seems that she doesn��t know the meaning in his words. She hugs him tightly as if she is a cat.
	Hooson presses his lips. And then he looks at Dan William in a speechless way.
	He is provoking him, because he held Jamie Moore��s hand just now!
	"Jamie, you should be careful. Otherwise, someone will keep you in his heart. Dan William takes a handkerchief out of his pocket at will, and then he wipes Jamie Moore��s wrist which Hooson touched just now.
	Jamie Moore is stunned for a moment, and then she knows the meaning in his words.
	
Chapter 282: A trump card.
	She laughs when she looks at the man who wipes her wrists. How could this man be so wicked?
	The expression on Hooson��s face is not good. Although he doesn��t refute Dan William��s words, he is not happy with this.
	However, he still has a trump card.
	"Jamie, have you forgotten Ryan Jack?" Hooson says slowly.
	Dan William frowns. He finds the woman in his arm is very nervous.
	He reaches out to pat on her back for a few times.
	"You should think carefully, and you only have one chance.�� Jamie Moore hears the voice of Hooson, and she struggles for a while.
	She could not see Ryan Jack die.
	A bullet runs to Dan William before Jamie Moore makes her decision. Although Hooson is watching the action of Dan William, the bullet still hits his arms, leaving a bloodstain.
	He raises his hand to look at the bloodstain on his hand. And then he looks at Dan William meaningfully.
	"Do you think I don��t make any preparation before I come here?�� Dan William��s eyesight is very cold, and the atmosphere around him is also very cold.
	Hooson presses his lips confidently, ��Are you willing to let Jamie Moore feel guilty all her life?"
	"Dan, let me go for exchange." Jamie Moore stays close with Dan William. Now she is very quiet, ��I believe you can extricate me."
	She is very confident in the ability of Dan William.
	"Silly girl." Dan William frowns slightly. "Even though you don��t go, I can also extricate Ryan Jack."
	"My father is not willing to do so. Are you willing to let her live in pain for a lifetime?" The soft and waxy voice sounds behind Dan William, and Jamie Moore looks at the direction of the voice in surprise.
	As expected, she sees the handsome face of Ian Moore, and Night.7 stands beside him.
	"Bunny!" Jamie Moore blinks her eyes, and cries at Ian Moore.
	"Mommy! I am here!" Ian Moore smiles at Jamie Moore, and then he sniffs.
	"Hmmm..." At this time, Night.7 pushes Anna Pork out, and her mouth is still stuffed with a cloth.
	"Anna!" When Hooson sees Anna Pork, the atmosphere around him becomes cold. Then he looks at Dan William, ��Who are you? How could you threat me with a woman?��
	He has hidden Anna Pork somewhere. How could they find Anna?
	He doesn��t know that Dan William has a huge team in his hand. The five-member organization under Ian Moore��s hand is a hidden force in the whole country C. Anyone among the five people has some independent power in their hand.
	This is the power given to them by the master of the Gilbert Family.
	Because Ian Moore is the owner of Myth Ring, and he is also the inheritor of the Gilbert Family, thus he combines five people into a powerful force. No one can match this five-member organization except the training camp owned by Dan William.
	"Who are you? How could you threat my daddy with my mommy?�� Although Ian Moore is still young, but the strong momentum around him can��t be ignored.
	Even Jamie Moore is surprised when she sees Ian Moore acts in such a way.
	Her baby is so handsome!
	"It��s very easy to find whether someone is a man or not.�� Dan William smiles, and then he says.
	Ian Moore praises Dan William, and then he asks Night.7 let Anna Pork go.
	Night.7 loosens her hand. Anna Pork falls on the ground after losing support behind her.
	"Anna Pork!" Hooson wants to pick Anna up, but Night.7 steps on the back of Anna's hand, ��If you continue to move, I will break her hand. Do you want to have a try?��
	Originally, Anna Pork��s hand is hurt. There is blood on her hand after stepping by Night.7. It looks very terrible.
	Jamie Moore looks at the scar on her wrist, and then she looks at Anna Pork. Ha. It��s true that every dog has its day.
	"Do you feel pain?" Seeing that Jamie Moore looks at her wrist, Dan William finds the scar on her wrist. Then he picks her hand up and looks at it carefully.
	Jamie Moore smiles, ��It��s not pain. I know how to cut myself in a proper way.��
	"Do you cut yourself?�� Dan William narrows his eyes after hearing the word of Jamie Moore, "Proper way?"
	Seeing that Dan William stares at her, Jamie Moore immediately understands. Will he kill her?
	"It��s good. I'll punish you when we come back.�� Dan William wears a smile on his face. But in Jamie Moore��s eyes, this smile is so horrible.
	She is over.
	Hooson says suddenly when Jamie Moore is absorbed in her mind.
	"OK, I'll let her go."
	Hooson lowers his head to hide the emotion in his eyes. Now no one knows his thinking.
	"You should let him go first, and then I will give Anna Pork to you.�� Ian Moore turns to look at Dan William after finishing his words.
	Dan William nods, and his eyesight is very dark.
	Hooson takes out his mobile phone and dials a number immediately. Then he hangs up after talking with him for a few words.
	A few minutes later, a man in black walks out from the Jones Family, and Ryan Jack follows behind him.
	When Jamie Moore sees Ryan Jack walks to her safe and sound, she relieves.
	"Here is Ryan Jack. Now you should let my sister go." Hooson asks the man in black to untie the rope on Ryan Jack's hand.
	"I count three, two, one, and then we should let them go at the same time.�� Night.7 holds the collar of Anna Pork, and says, "Three, two, one..."
	They let go of their hand at the same time after finishing counting.
	"Ryan! Are you OK?" When Jamie Moore sees Ryan Jack, she leaves the arms of Dan William immediately. She walks to look at Ryan Jack.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore leaves his arms, Dan William stars at the backing of Jamie Moore.
	Naughty girl. How could she leave his arm for other man? She is too naughty.
	Ian Moore looks at Dan William in a funny way.
	"What did they do to you?" Jamie Moore looks at Ryan Jack. She relieves when she finds nothing bad happened to Ryan Jack.
	It��s lucky that he is OK. Otherwise, she will feel guilty for a lifetime.
	"I'm fine. Don��t worry." Ryan Jack smiles, and his eyesight focuses on Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore frown, and she thinks there is something wrong, but she doesn��t know the exact points. Thus she decides not to think about this.
	"I am happy that you are OK."
	Hooson unties the rope on Anna Pork��s hand. And then he picks her up in his arms.
	He turns to look at Jamie Moore. Then the color in his eyes changes suddenly, and then he says, ��Jamie.��
	Jamie Moore looks at the man unhappily. She thinks he wants to say something to her.
	But Hooson just smiles at her, and then he leaves with Anna Pork in his arms.
	Jamie Moore doesn��t understand even after Hooson leaves. What��s the meaning of his smile?
	��Jamie, Jamie. He has gone.�� Ryan Jack pushes Jamie Moore.
	When Jamie Moore gets to her sense, and she sees the concerning eyes of Ryan Jack, the wrong feeling in heart appears again. But she still smiles at him.
	"Mommy, daddy has gone." Ian Moore says to Jamie Moore as he points at Dan William.
	Jamie Moore knows the meaning of Ian Moore immediately, and then she says to Ryan Jack, ��Ryan, I still have something to do, and you return back to home with Ian Moore first.��
	"Well, you can go." Ryan Jack smiles softly and nods.
	Jamie Moore runs to the direction that Dan William leaves immediately.
	Dan William walks quickly. Jamie Moore wants to catch him through the hall.
	But Caro Jones stops her this time, ��Jamie Moore, have you finished your work? Where is Hooson?��
Chapter 283: Do Himself a Favor.
	Jamie Moore is going to catch Dan William, but she is stopped by Caro Jones. Then she stares at Caro Jones, and says, ��Yes, he has gone.��
	"Has he gone?" Caro Jones smiles with content, ��That guy knows how to do himself a favor."
	Jamie Moore nods, and she is looking for Dan William in the hall. She tries to find the cold figure of Dan William.
	But she doesn��t find Dan William. Has he left here?
	"What are you looking for?" Caro Jones asks in bewilderment.
	"I have something to do now. And I have to go first." Jamie Moore is a little sad because she can��t find Dan William.
	Hearing that Jamie Moore wants to leave now, Caro Moore is a little unhappy. He holds her arms tightly, ��How could you never keep your word? Do you want to leave before the party finish?��
	"Young master, I really have something to do now!" Jamie Moore says sincerely, thus Caro Jones is a little embarrassed.
	He moves his eyesight in an embarrassed way, and then he coughs slightly, ��Since you really have something to do now, you should dance with me first. Then you don��t have to help me later.��
	"OK, good deal!" The eyesight of Jamie Moore become bright. He pulls Jamie Moore to dance hall immediately. He is afraid that Jamie Moore will refuse him.
	...
	Dan William just want to make a joke with Jamie Moore. But when he walks out of the hall, and he even waits for Jamie Moore for a while, he still doesn��t see the figure of Jamie Moore. Thus he returns back to find Jamie Moore.
	In the dance floor, Jamie Moore is dancing with a man.
	Mr. William gets angry after seeing this.
	He pulls a woman into the dance floor casually, and then he walks close to Jamie Moore and Caro Jones.
	What Jamie Moore thinks is whether she can find Dan William when this dance is over. But then she finds Dan William is dancing with a strange woman in the dance floor.
	She stares at that woman angrily. How could she touch his man?
	But even though she is angry, she still wears a smile on her delicate smile.
	They need to change dancing partners at the half of the dance. Thus Jamie Moore becomes the dancing partner of Dan William.
	The man in front of her is not in a good mood. He presses his lips. It seems that he is very angry.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she asks, ��Why do you have a dance with other woman?��
	Dan William holds her waist tightly, and says, ��Why do you have a dance with other man?��
	Jamie Moore is choked, thus she acts cutely.
	"Who is that man?" But Dan William doesn��t buy it. He presses his lips , and he looks at Jamie Moore coldly.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Dan William gets angry. Thus she tells the truth to Dan William.
	"His name is Caro Jones. He saves me when I run out from the villa of Hooson. Tonight, I need to return the favor.��
	The cold expression on Dan William��s face changes, and then he says, ��I don��t know this woman, and I pull her out randomly.��
	What?
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Does he just pull a strange womanrandomly? Mr. William, are you a child?
	"You can only dance with me in the future. You are not allowed to touch other women." Jamie Moore says indignantly.
	Dan William doesn��t answer her, but he asks, ��And you?��
	Although Jamie Moore is bluntness, she is not stupid. He knows the meaning of Dan William��s word soon. She looks at him and says, ��If you can do this, I also can do this.��
	She really doesn��t let other people take advantage of her��
	Dan William smiles, and then he finishes the dance with Jamie Moore.
	"Jamie Moore, you..." Caro Jones also stops, and then he walks to Jamie Moore.
	"Caro Jones, I'm leaving now. I'll come to see you at your convenience." Jamie Moore smiles at him. Then she leaves the dance floor with Dan William.
	Jamie Moore and Dan William go back to City A by helicopter.
	Jamie Moore is moved when she breathes the air of City A again.
	"Mommy, Ian Moore and Night.7 will send Godfather back. You and dad go home first."
	Jamie Moore looks at Night.7 who is smiling. According to the performance of this woman on the island just now, this woman can be trusted.
	"OK, please go back quickly. Mommy will wait for you to have breakfast." Jamie Moore rubs his little head and watches them get into a special car.
	She turns around, and then she looks at Dan William who is on the phone. He hangs up a few minutes later, and then he looks at Jamie Moore.
	"My mom and dad are back. They're in the villa of the William Family now." He says with a touch of apprehension on his brow.
	Jamie Moore is shocked, ��You go there first. Derek William will send me back."
	Dan William nods, ��Be careful on your way. I'll go back later."
	Seeing that Dan William drives away, Jamie Moore is a little sad.
	-
	Dan William drives to the villa of the William Family. He looks at the Moore Family before she enters the house.
	Jack Moore and Celina Swift have got out of the hospital, and now they are having a rest at home. Since he knows Jamie Moore has no relationship with the Moore Family, Dan William has a bad expression on the Moore family.
	He walks into the home without any hesitation. Cindy Swift says hello to him immediately, ��Young master, you are back. They are all waiting for you."
	He nods slightly, and then he walks into the villa without any expression.
	He still wears the shirt and trousers he wore yesterday. There is some blue color under his eye socket, but his eyes are full of light. It seems that he is very strong.
	Maybe they haven��t have lunch together for a long time, thus the whole family members talks and laughs in the living room. But Dan William finds that there is another man present.
	"Dan, you are back." Jozo is chatting with Dan William��s mother and Amelia intimately. When she finds Dan William walks into the home, she looks at him immediately.
	"Brother, you are back." Dan William is still a little guilty about the previous thing, thus she calls Dan William in a weak voice.
	��Dan, come here.�� Dan William��s mother makes some room Dan William.
	Dan William��s father holds a morning news in his hand. He glances at Dan William, but there is no expression on his face.
	Dan William nods, and then he walks to sit on the single sofa opposite them.
	Dan William stares at Jozo, ��How can you be here?"
	Jozo is shocked, and then she lowers her head in an embarrassed way.
	Dan William��s mother looks at Dan William, and then she pats on the hand of Jozo, ��Dan, how could you say such word? Jozo saves my life. You should thank her.��
	��What happened?�� Dan William frowns, and then he asks.
	"I had a headache, and I got lost with your father at the airport, and I almost faint. It��s this girl who took me to the hospital." Speaking of this, Dan William��s mother smiles happily. She looks at Jozo, and she is very satisfied with Jozo..
	"What a coincidence?" Dan William's eyes are full of invisible feeling.
	Jozo explains immediately, ��I have a friend coming from France, thus I met Miss. William at the airport...��
	Then she stops talking, and her voice is full of grievance.
	Dan William��s mother stares at Dan William, ��Have I pretended to have a headache?��
	Dan William stops talking, and he doesn��t say anything later.
	"Mom, what a coincidence. Sister Jozo saves the life of brother before, and now she also saves the life of you. Isn't it a special fate?" Amelia holds the arms of his mother intimately with a smile.
	Dan William��s mother is shocked, ��Really? Why don��t I know this thing?��
	Jozo smiles sheepishly, and then she lowers her head.
	��The reason that sister Jozo loses her legs is to save the life of brother. If I lose my legs, I will kill myself.�� Amelia says vigorously.
	
Chapter 284: I Don’t Feel Aggrieved
	The expression on Dan William’s face is not very good…
	"Is this the truth?" Mrs. William exclaims, and then she looks at Jozo painfully, “Good baby, I am sorry that you have suffered this.”
	Jozo still wears a gentle and soft smile on her face, thus Dan William’s mother is very appreciated of her, Auntie, so many years has passed, and I don’t feel aggrieved.”
	"This is not right. It’s because Dan that you are in such way. Dan will be responsible for you!" Dan William’s mother says confidently, and she even has made the decision for Dan William.
	"I won't." Dan William turns away without looking at Jozo.
	"Bad guy, what did you say? Jozo has saved your life. You should be responsible for her. Am I right?” Dan William’s mother has a bad temper. Thus she slaps the sofa, and stares at Dan William.
	Dan William answers casually, "So, should I sell myself to her?"
	Mrs. William is very angry, thus she pulls the sleeve of Dan William’s father, “Hey, you should say something for me. Should Dan marry Jozo?”
	Dan William’s father shakes his head, and says, “There are so many ways to repay Jozo. You should ask the opinion of Jozo first.”
	Then Mrs. William turns to look at Jozo, “Jozo, are you willing to marry Dan?”
	Jozo is such a good girl. She doesn’t want to miss this daughter-in-law-to-be.
	"Um…I..." Jozo lowers her head with a red face, and it seems that she is very shy.
	Mrs. William has experienced this, thus she knows the meaning of Jozo immediately, “Ha-ha, Jozo has no objection to this!"
	"I disagree with this." Dan William presses his lips, and then he glances at Jozo and his mother, “If you love her, you can marry her.”
	Dan William’s mother is shocked. She turns to looks at Jozo, and then she finds the sadness on Jozo’s face. Thus she pulls the sleeve of Dan William’s father, “You should say something for this!”
	Dan William’s father reads the newspaper calmly, and then he says, “Do you like the daughter of the Moore Family.”
	The whole living room is quiet when Dan William’s father finishes his words.
	"Yes." Dan William answers without any hesitation.
	Jamie Moore has given birth to his son, but he doesn’t plan to tell his parents at this time. The surprise will be the best chance for them to accept her.
	He doesn’t tell his parents about his son. Why?
	Jozo gets something to expect after seeing Dan William’s action. Maybe he doesn’t care about Jamie Moore at all. Maybe it’s for the child that he stays beside Jamie Moore.
	…
	Jamie Moore goes to sleep after having lunch. She takes her wounded hand out from the quilt. She looks at the scar on her hand, and she feels that what she experienced is a dream.
	She has a sense of security only when she wraps herself in the quilt. Then she begins to lose her sense, and thus she falls asleep.
	She had a dream. In the dream, Mrs. William takes Ian Moore away. And she lets Jozo and Dan William to support her son, and she even asks her to get away as soon as possible.
	She chases them hardly in the back, but she still couldn't catch up with them. At last, she watches them take Ian Moore away…
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore wakes up frightened, and then she gasps heavily.
	She reaches out to pick the remote control, and then she turns on the light. And then she calms down gradually.
	Why does she dream of this suddenly? Is she too tired?
	Jamie Moore rubs her temples. She glances at the clock, and she is a little surprised. It’s almost ten o’clock in the evening.
	She is a little hungry now. Thus she walks to the chicken in her pajamas.
	What she cooks is chicken porridge and a few dishes, and then she puts them on the table.
	She smells the strong smell of chicken porridge greedily, and then she holds the bowl in her hand.
	But the bowl in her hand is snatched by another hand.
	Dan William holds the bowl in his hand calmly, and then he drinks all the porridge in the bowl quickly.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips with grievance, and then she glares at him in a sulk.
	Dan William puts the bowl down contentedly. Then he wants to rub Jamie Moore’s head, but Jamie Moore dodges away, "What's the matter?"
	"You drink my porridge, and what do you want to do?” Jamie Moore stares at him.
	He can rob everything from her, but he can’t rub the food from her!
	"It's just a bowl of porridge. Why are you so stingy?" Dan William smiles. She likes food so much, and she protects food as if she protects her child. Thus he stops teasing her, and walks to the kitchen.
	After a while, he walks to Jamie Moore with two bowls in his hand refilled with chicken porridge.
	Jamie Moore smells the fragrance in the air, and she looks at the porcelain bowl in his hand longingly.
	"Here you are." Dan William puts one of the bowls in front of Jamie Moore. And then he begins to eat the porridge in another bowl.
	Jamie Moore stops playing with Dan William. She begins to eat porridge happily.
	Jamie Moore fumbles some fruit from the fridge after eating the porridge. And then she eats it on the sofa after washing them.
	Dan William looks at her. And then he finds that Jamie Moore is wearing a deep V-neck Pajama today. The skirt on her body is only up to her knee. The long and white legs of her are exposed outside.
	And then desire appeared in his eyes.
	Jamie Moore holds the fruit tray in her arms. She puts the fruit into her mouth with one hand from time to time, and she stares at the TV screen closely. She eats the fruit as she watches the TV, and it seems that she is very comfortable.
	Dan William can’t oppress the desire from the bottom of his heart. Then he walks to Jamie Moore, and takes the fruit tray from her arms.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore looks at Dan William with confusion.
	Dan William doesn’t answer her. Instead, he sits beside Jamie Moore with a smile. He rubs Jamie Moore’s shoulder and says,“What’d you say?”
	Jamie Moore’s face become red suddenly, “No, be serious…” Jamie Moore pushes Dan William.
	But how could Dan William let her go so easily? He hugs her in his arms tightly, and he looks at Jamie Moore with a soft smile.
	Jamie Moore is caught in a little daze, and then closes her eyes with expectation.
	Right at this inconvenient moment, a cute voice interrupts them.
	"Daddy, are you bullying Mommy?"
	Jamie Moore and Dan William stop their action suddenly, and they turn around awkwardly. And then they find Ian Moore standing in front of sofa.
	Ian Moore rubs his eyes with one hand. And he looks at the people on the sofa, puzzled.
	Dan William's face is a little gloomy, and there is a touch of displeasure in his eyes.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t expect that Ian Moore would go downstairs at this time. But she is not shy, thus she asks Ian Moore,“Why don't you go to sleep?"
	Ian Moore presses his lips,“I want to drink water.”
	In fact, he does this on purpose. He wants to make some trouble with his father.
	"Drink it quickly, and then go to bed." Dan William gives him a meaningful look.
	Ian Moore nods. He pretends that he doesn’t know anything, and he goes to drink water.
	Seeing that Ian Moore walks away, Dan William walks to the room with Jamie Moore in his arms.
	…
	It's been many days since Jamie Moore is kidnapped, and there are still 20 days left for Harriet Chris' wedding, so Jamie Moore doesn’t have so much time.
	At the beginning, Jamie Moore draws in the office. But she gets tired. Several papers are thrown into the garbage can.
	The weather is very good. Since she has no inspiration for drawing, Jamie Moore decides to go shopping for inspiration.
	But Jamie Moore finally meets Amelia and Dan William’s mother when she is shopping.
Chapter 285: Neither Arrogant nor Obsequious.
	"Once I go out, I meet someone I don't like." Amelia rolls at Jamie Moore.
	Mrs. William also looks at Jamie Moore, but there is no love in her eyes.
	But Jamie Moore thinks that she doesn’t owe anything to the William Family.
	"How about having a cup of coffee together?" Mrs. William orders in a noble and dignified attitude.
	Jamie Moore raises a smile on her face, “OK.”
	They choose a coffee shop nearby and then sit down.
	"What's the matter? Miss William." Jamie Moore sits straightly, and then she says in a tone neither arrogant nor obsequious .
	"Now that you left my son alone, why do you come back? Is it not enough for you to hurt my son?" This is why Mrs. William is so angry.
	Back to that time, Jamie Moore left suddenly regardless of the face of the William Family.
	"The reason that I come back is because of my home. My home is here. As for Dan William, I never want to hurt him." Jamie Moore says in a calm way.
	She said courteously and sincerely.
	"Save it. Even though you can deceive my brother now, my brother will find out your real purpose sooner or later." Amelia snorts with disdain.
	“…” Jamie Moore is speechless. It's a waste of time to talking with them.
	Mrs. William thinks Amelia’s word very reasonable. She looks at Jamie Moore unhappily, “Since you left in the past, now please don't pester my son."
	She continues to say before Jamie Moore answers. “How much do you want? As long as you don’t pester my son, I can give you a lot of money.”
	Jamie Moore feels cold suddenly, and her eyes are full of coldness.
	How could she insult her with money?
	"Mrs. William, have you gone too far?" Jamie Moore takes a deep breath, and she tries all her effort to calm down.
	"Don't talk nonsense. How much do you want?" Mrs. William says directly.
	"Mrs. William, are you sure that you would regret saying this?” Jamie Moore asks with a smile. She hides the sadness in her eyes, and on one could find the sadness in her eyes.
	Mrs. William looks at her with confusion.
	And Amelia is a little flustered. Her hand trembles and the coffee then gets poured on Mrs. Williams.
	"Ah!"
	"Sorry, Mom! I did’t do this on purpose!" Amelia takes several paper towels out quickly, and then wipes the dirty mark for her.
	Mrs. William goes to the bathroom with her bag after stopped by Amelia.
	When her mother goes to the bathroom, Amelia says to Jamie Moore directly, “You have no choose, and you’d better fuck off with the check quickly.”
	"You send your mother away with such an excuse. The reason is you are afraid that your mother will know the existence Ian?" Jamie Moore looks at Amelia with a sarcastic smile on her delicate face.
	She never wants Mrs. William know the existence of Ian Moore.
	"Hum, I know that you are good at talking, but it’s no use. My mother is very satisfied with Jozo. She asks my brother to marry Jozo, and my brother agrees with this." Amelia says.
	Jamie Moor knows that Dan William won't let others decide his marriage, but Amelia says in such a confident way, thus she is a little doubt about this.
	Dan William, will you marry other people?
	Instead of sitting there, Jamie Moore picks the bag up, and then she leaves the café shop.
	She keeps thinking the words of Amelia in the way.
	And she walks through the whole road unconsciously.
	Seeing that someone is shooting a promotional film on the stage, Jamie Moore walks to have a look. Unexpectedly, it’s July Summer.
	July Summer dresses herself in a long black tight skirt. She poses in front of the background board. She looks very beautiful, and she looks like an elf.
	It seems that she also finds Jamie Moore standing under the stage. Thus she walks to Jamie Moore in the rest time.
	"Why are you here? Shouldn't you be at work?" July Summer walks to Jamie Moore with her arms around her chest.
	"I skipped it , can't I?" Jamie Moore has a good expression on July Summer.
	"You look bad." July Summer finds that Jamie Moore is not very happy at the first sight. She looks at Jamie Moore with worries, and then she says to her, “Shall I take you to a place?"
	"Aren’t you working?" Jamie Moore looks at her in confusion. Does she want to leave in the working time?
	"I don’t want to have work now. Don't talk nonsense. Let's go." July Summer pushes Jamie Moore forward.
	“…”
	They walk to the restaurant on the top floor of the commercial building. It’s on the tenth floor.
	Jamie Moore has been afraid of heights since the fall last time.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore has a pale face, July Summer says with a smile, “What are you afraid of? We will never fall down from here.”
	They sit near the window. And they could see the scenery outside from here. It’s very high.
	"If you're in a bad mood, it's better to see the scenery from here." July Summer waves her hand, and the waiter comes to them at once.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and she doesn’t say anything. She is very afraid of this. Does she have any mood to enjoy the scenery?
	"What would you like to eat? It's my treat today." July Summer flips the menu.
	Jamie Moore says the name of several dishes without hesitation.
	The waiter brings the food to the table soon.
	Miss Moore begins eating food. She has walked for a long time, and she is very hungry now.
	Jamie Moore drinks the juice at will, “Do you have a good relationship with Dan? July Summer asks inadvertently.
	Jamie Moore stops suddenly, and then she looks at July Summer. Then she answers, “It’s OK.”
	“You have a bad mood now. Is it for him? July Summer asks in a confident way.
	Since Jamie Moore doesn’t answer her, this is the truth.
	“You can tell me, and maybe I can give you some suggestion.”
	Jamie Moore looks at July Summer in surprise. It’s abrupt for her to say such word.
	July Summer smiles sweetly,“Gimme your hand.”
	Jamie Moore hands her hand to July Summer after thinking for a while.
	July Summer writes in Jamie Moore’s hand quickly, and then she looks at Jamie Moore with a meaningful look.
	Jamie Moore is thrilled, and then she looks at July Summer in surprise, “Are you?”
	But then she doubts the words of July Summer. What if she is the man send by Jack Moore?
	"I know you doubt me now, because I can't take that thing out." July Summer shrugs. It’s her fault. She lost that thing.
	"Where is the thing?" Jamie Moore asks with doubt.
	"I lost it." July Summer is a little embarrassed. It's a small thing to lose this thing. I'm afraid that someone will get it…
	"Oh." Jamie Moore answers lightly. She would not believe her so easily.
	July Summer know Jamie Moore’s thinking, thus she doesn't force her. Thus she continues the topic just now.
	Jamie Moore tells the thing to July Summer. Although she says in a calm way, she holds the knife tightly.
	"Obviously, they are making trouble with you and Dan William. You are so smart, aren’t you understand?"
	Jamie Moore wears a bitter smile on her face, “I don’t care about this.”
	"Any further stories?"
	"Eating food, and I am hungry.” Jamie Moore doesn’t answer July Summer, and then she bows to eat the spaghetti on the plate.
	"Alas." July Summer sighs. She knows that Jamie Moor doesn’t want to talk this, thus she stops talking.
	After eating, they go to the most famous haunted house in city. They don’t go home until about 10 p.m.
	When Jamie Moore returns home, she is shocked after seeing the figure sitting on the sofa.
Chapter 286: Sulk Again?
	After thinking for a while, she finds that she hasn’t done anything wrong. There is nothing to worry.
	Thus she walks behind Dan William quietly. She is ready to thrill him, but then she hears his vice, “Did you have a good time?”
	Jamie Moore withdraws her hands, and then she answers, “Yes.”
	"Where are you going? Who are you stayed with?" Dan William stands up from sofa. He narrows his eyes, and his eyes are full of frightening light.
	“I go to the business street with July summer.” Jamie Moore answers.
	"Sulk again?" Dan William stares at her. He knows her well. Thus he knows that she is angry.
	Jamie Moore smiles, and then she hugs his neck with her hands. Then she changes the topic, “I promise I will never do this later.”
	The expression on Dan William’s face is still bad. The more she pretends, the more problem there is. Then he picks Jamie Moore up, and walks upstairs without saying a word.
	When they just walk to the second floor, Ian Moore walks to them. He hugs Dan William’s leg, and do not let him go.
	“Daddy, you are bullying mother again!”
	Dan William smiles at Ian Moore,“Baby, do you want to have a little brother or sister?”
	Ian Moore nod,“Yes, I want.”
	His little sister must be very cute.
	"Then you should keep quite. Don't disturb your mommy and me tonight. You will soon have a little sister." Dan William says gently to Ian Moore.
	Hearing this, Jamie Moore even wants to die.
	Ian Moore lets him go immediately, and he even waves at Jamie Moore. Then he sends them away.
	Jamie Moore leans against the shoulder of Dan William, and her hearts thumps like there were a thousand horses running in.
	"What's the matter?" Dan William throws her on the bed, and then he says with his hand holding Jamie Moore’s face.
	"Nothing..." Jamie Moore stares at him with her cheek bulged.
	"Don’t you want to tell me?" Dan William smiles. "Since you don't want to say, I don't force you, but you should know the consequence."
	Jamie Moore gets threatened by Dan William’s words,“I went shopping for inspiration, and then I met your mother. I chatted with her for a few minutes, and then I met July Summer. We went to the haunted house, and then I forget the time.” She says in a light tone.
	"What did my mother say?"
	"She asked something about my life. We just talk some small thing in our life.” Jamie Moore blinks her eyes, as if what she said is the truth.
	Dan William's hand has come to her shoulder belt, "Don’t you want to tell me the truth?” Dan William wears a wider smile on his face.
	"OK, OK, I will tell you all thing!" Jamie Moore smiles, and she tries to get rid of Dan William’s hand.
	"But I don't want to know it now." The slender body of Dan William approaches to her gradually.
	"No, you should listen to my words..."
	Dan William doesn’t give her chance to talk, and then they fall on the bed together…
	The next day, Jamie Moore goes to the company in a trembled way. Boss Dan is treacherous, and he made love with her in such a hard way.
	After finishing the sketch of the design draft, she scans it into the computer, and she even draws half of the style drawing.
	At noon, Jamie Moore goes to find Dan William as soon as she gets off work.
	"Bully…Landlord..." Jamie Moore scolds lightly. Then she stands up in a strange posture, and then she walks to the office of Dan William slowly.
	When she opens the door of the president office, she doesn’t see Dan William. Instead, she hears the voice from the VIP room.
	"Dan." Jamie Moore pushes the door of the VIP room, and then the smile on her face freezes.
	All three women are here.
	"Hello, Mrs.William, Miss Amelia, and Miss Jozo." Although she wants to leave here immediately, she still says hello to them politely.
	Mrs. William glances at Jamie Moore, and then she withdraws her eyesight. She looks at Dan William, and says with a strong heart, "Dan, you should take good care of your employees, thus your reputation will not be destroyed by others."
	"Yes, elder brother, she is just a staff of your company. How could she call your name directly? She is so audacious." Amelia rolls at Jamie Moore.
	Although Jozo doesn’t say anything, Jamie Moore still could find the gloat in her eyes.
	Dan William looks at Amelia coldly, and Amelia dares not to talk more, thus she stops talking.
	"Wait a minute, and I'll take you to have lunch immediately." Dan William stands up, and then he walks to Jamie Moore with a smile. He rubs her hair. She is his woman, and no one could bully her.
	Mrs. William snorts, and she doesn’t have any good expression on Jamie Moore now, “Dan, today you should have lunch with Jozo, and Jamie Moore will have lunch with Amelia and me.”
	She says like she is patronizing her.
	The eyelids of Jamie Moore jumps, and she is a little speechless…
	"I'm afraid that I don’t have any appetite if I have lunch." Dan William says coldly.
	"You!" Mrs. William is angry, and she even wants to beat him.
	Although Dan William doesn’t say the name, Jozo knows that means ‘with her’.
	She's in a panic. She can't make him hate her!
	"Auntie, we can eat together, and all of us will be happy in such way." Jozo finds an excuse for Mrs. William, thus Mrs. William is not embarrassed.
	Mrs. Willian's face eases a little, and she shows herself in a dignified posture. "Let's go."
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he nods. “OK.”
	Mrs. William walks out first, and then Amelia pushes Jozo out next.
	Jamie Moore sighs in the bottom of her heart. She is going to the guillotine…
	"I'm here." Dan William holds her small hand gently.
	Jamie Moore looks at him, and she feels very safe.
	Mrs. William chooses a restaurant near CR. When they arrive at the restaurant, the waiter takes them to the compartment after Mrs. William says her own name to the waiter.
	Sure enough, they make preparation before they go here, Jamie Moore says in her heart in secret.
	The decoration in the compartment is unique and elegant, and it’s very luxurious everywhere, which is the style of Mrs. William.
	Jamie Moore is about to sit beside Dan William, but Amelia sits immediately. She says with provocation on her face. "I want to be here."
	Jamie Moore is not angry, and then she sits beside Mrs. William
	They do this on purpose, but she doesn’t want to fight with her. It’s just a seat.
	Dan William frowns, and the atmosphere around him is very cold.
	After ordering the food, only Amelia keeps talking on the table.
	"Dan, you should go out with Jozo more since." Mrs. William smiles happily, as if Dan William and Jozo have been dating already.
	Jozo lowers her head in an embarrassing way, and she looks at Dan William secretly.
	Jamie Moore is a little uncomfortable. Mrs. William tries all her effort to get them together.
	When Mrs. William sees Ian Moore, what will she think? Jamie Moore is very eager to see this.
	"Mom, do you mean that I should leave the whole CR behind and go shopping with her?" Dan William presses his lips, and then he looks at Jozo.
	Jamie Moore gives a thumb to Dan William. Dan William’s word is so sharp.
	It's a big pressure. If the CR's senior management and staff know this, how will it be?
	"Dan, Auntie doesn't mean that. Career is important." Jozo looks at the cold eyes of Dan William, and then she says with a smile.
	Although Mrs. William doesn’t show her anger out, she is very angry in fact.
	Dan does everything against her since Jamie Moore appears.
	The waiter soon serves the food on the table.
	"Let’s have lunch now." Every one begins to eat when Mrs. William finishing her words.
	"Aunt, you can have a try of this dish." Jozo picks a piece of chicken to Mrs. William's bowl, but she doesn't find that the expression on her face changes instantly.
	Jamie Moore has heard that Mrs. William is allergic to mushrooms. So there are mushrooms in this dish.
Chapter 287: Mrs. William is Allergic to Mushrooms.
	Jamie Moore takes the porcelain bowl in front of Mrs. William away, and then she waves at the waiter,“Sorry, please give me another bowl of rice. Thank you."
	The waiter nods, and then goes out.
	Then the expression on Mrs. William eases a little. She looks at Jamie Moore with surprise. She even knows that she can’t eat mushroom.
	"Miss Moore, what do you mean? Why did you take aunt's bowl away?" Jozo narrows her eyes, and then she looks at Jamie Moore discontentedly.
	Jamie Moore smiles, and then she stares at Jozo, “Miss Jozo, Mrs. William is allergic to mushrooms.”
	Jozo’s face turns pale immediately, then she looks at Mrs. William at a loss. "I'm sorry, aunt. I don't know that you are allergic to mushrooms..."
	"Mom, it’s understandable that Jozo doesn’t know this." Amelia says.
	Mrs. William nods, and some feeling flashes in her heart.
	"It's OK. Let’s eat now." Mrs. William picks up her bowl, and eats in a graceful way.
	Jozo relieves, and then she looks at Amelia in a grateful way.
	"Dan, this is fillet cooked with sugar and vinegar, and you love it.” Seeing that it’s not good to flatter Mrs. William, Jozo picks up the fillet, and puts it into Dan William’s bowl.
	Dan William frowns,“Sorry, I got mysophobia."
	Puh!
	Jamie Moore almost let burst her laughter. Luckily, she is so determined that she will do anything to keep quiet.
	Does he mean Jozo is dirty someway?
	Jamie Moore puts a piece of meat in her mouth, so as to hides the smile on the corner of her mouth.
	But she doesn’t expect that the next action of Dan William is much worse than before.
	"Jamie Moore." He asks.
	"Ah?" Jamie Moore looks up. She's fighting with a crab.
	"Give your bowl to me." He says.
	Jamie Moore hands her bowl to Dan William without any hesitation.
	Dan William turns the glass, thus his bowl with the fillet is pushed away. And then he begins to eat with Jamie Moore’s bowl.
	What’s the matter? What are you doing, Boss Williams?
	Jamie Moore is shocked. She thinks that he will peel the crab for her, thus he takes her bowl. But now he eats with her bowl!
	Mrs. Dan just looks at the action of Dan William, and she doesn’t say anything.
	Jozo’s face turns pale completely. Do they hate her?
	Amelia disagrees, “Brother, what are you doing? Don't you have mysophobia?"
	Dan William answers calmly, “Which one do you want, dirty or clean?" Dan William glances at Amelia.
	"Of course, I will choose clean one.” Amelia blurts out, and then she looks at Jozo awkwardly.
	She suddenly understands the meaning. Does he mean Jozo is dirty, and Jamie Moore is clean?”
	Other women will leave immediately feeling embarrassed. But Jozo just sits there, and her face is very pale.
	It's a pity that what she faces is Dan William, who always says in a sharp and fierce way. He knows the bad thing in Jozo’s heart.
	Cool!
	Jamie Moore is very happy in her heart, but she still keeps calm, and she eats calmly.
	"By the way, Dan, how did you think the thing I told you that day?" It’s very silent on the table, thus Mrs. William breaks the silence finally.
	Jamie Moore is a little confused. What’s that?
	Dan William pretends that he doesn’t hear anything, and then he continues to eat food.
	"Aunt, Miss Jamie is still there." Jozo smiles shyly, and she acts like a well-bred lady from rich family.
	Mrs. William frowns, and then she looks at Jamie Moore. What qualifications do you have for being in a bad mood.
	"Nothing, it's our family business. What do you want to do with outsiders?" Mrs. William says.
	Outsiders?
	Does Mrs. William mean she is the last person to show up at the dinner?
	Jozo smiles proudly. As long as Mrs. William is here, she will be the heir consort of William's family.
	“When did Jozo become a part of the William Family." Dan William puts down his chopsticks, and then he takes a paper towel to wipe his mouth, and says.
	"Brother, isn't this a matter of time?" Amelia says, and then she glances at Jamie Moore to observe the expression on her face.
	Dan William’s face become dark, “Do you mean to decide my marriage?"
	"Not me, but mommy and daddy can decide this, am I right?” Amelia shrinks her neck. She is a little afraid of this, but she also wants to refute him.
	Dan William looks at Jozo, and then says, “Who accept this, and who will marry you! I will never marry with a vase.”
	Vase?
	Jamie Moore wants to keep herself calm, but she laughs.
	Jozo stares at her fiercely.
	"You!" Mrs. William gnashes her teeth, and she looks at Jamie Moore in a bad way. She says with a sneer, “A vase will know how to behave her. But a vain woman will only seek your power."
	Jamie Moore’s heart suddenly becomes cold. She eats in a stiff way, and she pretends that she doesn’t know the meaning in Mrs. William’s word.
	"Mom!" Dan William looks at Mrs. William coldly, “In the past, you didn't do what a mother should do. Now please don't make a decision for my life."
	"I do all this for you!" Mrs. William is a little guilty, but she still says in a strong way.
	"Is this right?" Dan William doesn’t refute her words, and he just smiles coldly. He stands up and walks towards Jamie Moore, “Let’s go.”
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she grasps the big palm in front of her, and then they leave the room together.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t speak anything all the way.
	Dan William turns to looks at Jamie Moore. He stops when he sees the lowering head of Jamie Moore.
	"What's the matter?" He raises Jamie Moore’s little head, and holds her chin. The feeling of touch is very good.
	Dan William shrinks his eyesight when he finds the expression on Jamie Moore’s face. Her eyes are full of tears.
	"I promise that I will not marry Jozo." Dan William thinks she is sad because of what happened at the dinner table just now, thus he says in a hurry way.
	But tears on Jamie Moore’s eyes fall down instead.
	"Don't cry." Dan William touches Jamie Moore’s face, and he wipes the tears on her face. "Don't cry, you'll soon catch up with Kiki."
	That smart and soft kiki is eating delicious food in the manor. And he is basking in the grass with Ian Moore.
	Jamie Moore’s face turns red, and then she says in a difficulty way, “I, I didn’t swallow the food down just now...”
	She cries because something stuck in her throat. She is not sad for the word of Mrs. William and Jozo.
	Dan William presses his lips hardly, and then he walks to the opposite of the road after saying “Wait for me.”
	"You..." Jamie Moore's face is very red.
	Dan William comes back with a bottle of water and a bag of handkerchief in his hand soon. Then he hands the water to Jamie, “Drink it slowly, and swallow the thing in the throat down.”
	Jamie Moore finally swallows the rice on her throat down with water.
	"Ah… It's too terrible." She sighs comfortably, and then she touches her throat again. She finally survives.
	"No one will blame you. What's the hurry?" Dan William flips her forehead, and then he takes out a paper towel to wipe the water stains on the corners of her mouth.
	…
Chapter 288: Damn Woman, Where Have You Kicked?
	In the night club.
	Anna Pork is drunk, and she walks in an unsteady way. At last, she can only stand up against the door panel.
	Bruce Hill is a little shocked. Now this woman is very quiet, and now she looks much smarter than usual. She looks like a woman now.
	Bruce Hill stay close to Anna Pork, thus he even could smell the fragrance of the flower on her body.
	Bruce Hill’s eyes become bright suddenly. In the past, he always smells the strong fragrance of perfume from his partners, but the fragrance on her body is different from others.
	The fragrance is very fresh. Bruce always smells the strong fragrance of perfume, thus he is not accustomed to this.
	"What do you want to do?" Anna Pork drinks too much alcohol. Seeing that Bruce Hill walks close to her, Anna Pork takes a step back, but behind her is the wall, thus where can she go?
	"Don't move." Bruce Hill raises Anna Pork’s hand, and then puts Anna Pork’s hand in front of his nose. He doesn’t know why he did this. Then his eyes become bright suddenly. It’s this smell, and there is no trace of perfume. It seems that this is the odor of the body.
	...
	Anna Pork laughs for a while, and then she lifts her knees sharply, and then she kicks the lower part of Bruce Hill.
	"Ah!" Bruce Hill doesn’t have any preparation of this, thus the sweat falls down from his forehead, and he even bends his body down.
	Damn, where have you kicked?
	"What sound is it?" The voice of doubt coming from the door after Bruce Hill shuts. Then Bruce Hill realizes that he is in the women's bathroom. Thus he covers his mouth to avoid shouting.
	Bruce Hill feels that the lower part of his body is very painful, and he even can’t bear this. He wants to kill Anna Pork!
	"Damn man. Haven’t you had enough from flirting with your last woman? And now, you even want to take advantage of me. Hum. Anna Pork begins to lose her sense, but she still could realize the actions of the people in front of her.
	Does he want to take advantage of her? If he doesn’t practice himself for several years, he should not do this. Otherwise, he will be beaten badly.
	"Is there any sound? Did you hear it wrong?"
	"Really? OK. Let's go. "
	Bruce Hill covers the mouth of Anna Pork. He loosens his hand until the woman outside walks away. As soon as he loosens his hand, he immediately holds the neck of Anna Pork. He stares at Anna Pork with anger, “Dead Woman, I’m so kind, and I take you to the bathroom. How could you treat me like this?”
	Anna Pork is drunk, and she even doesn’t know what he said. She just smiles. Usually, she will pinch him back immediately. Now she looks like a small sheep, thus Bruce Hill, who is very angry, loses his anger immediately.
	Bruce Hill stares at her, “Do you think I dare not to do anything to you since you are drunk? You treat me like this, and I will kill you!”
	Then he holds Anna Pork on his shoulder as he says. Then he dials a number, and walks out.
	"Hello? Brother, I suddenly have something to do, so I'll go back first. You could enjoy yourself. Don't worry about me..."
	...
	After walking out of the bathroom, Jamie Moore hangs in the William Manor alone.
	Jamie Moore walks to the courtyard. She looks up, and then she finds the manor of the Moore Family very dark. Compared with the happy atmosphere of the William Family, the Moore Family is very quiet.
	It's said that Jack Moore also received the invitation letter, but he didn’t find his daughter. If Jack Moore comes to the party in such situation, he would not be a man.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips coldly. The light in the room reflect in her eyes. There is no fluctuation on her delicate face. She walks forward on the soft soil under her feet.
	...
Chapter 289: Sapphire Bracelet
	In the next day.
	"I will show you something." Dan William suddenly reminds of something. Then he opens the drawer, and then hands a picture to Jamie Moore.
	"Bruce Hill always wears this necklace. He said that he pulled it from Joey Lan's wrist before he lost his sense, and later he also finds Joey Lan by this.” Dan William says.
	Jamie Moore looks at that necklace on the picture, and then she presses her lips.
	Wendy’s parents bought the Sapphire Bracelet at a high price. And they send it to Wendy on Wendy’s seventeenth..
	That gem is very famous. It's carved into the shape of a snowflake, because Wendy's birthday is in winter. They even ask someone to dig a small hole in the middle, and a piece of rice with Wendy’s name engraved on the middle of the hole.
	Duke Field is really stupid....He is so stupid. He recognizes the wrong person, and he even finds other woman with Wendy’s necklace.
	"This is Wendy’s bracelet. This gem is unique. We can't find a second one!" Jamie Moore holds it and says excitedly.
	In this way, Duke Field really recognizes the wrong person.
	"What do you want to do?" Dan William takes the photo back. When they are still at school, they take this picture. Dan William has been collecting it.
	"Of course, we should tell this to Duke Field. It's not fair to Wendy!"
	Dan William presses her lips, and then he looks at her, “If you tell this to Duke Field, will he believe this?”
	Jamie Moore looks at him in a puzzled way, and the excitement in her eyes disappear gradually.
	"In the eyes of Duke Field, Joey Lan is what he persists from the beginning. If he knows his persistence is wrong all the time, he will lose himself." Dan William walks to the front of Jamie Moore as he says, and then he rubs Jamie Moore’s hair.
	Jamie Moore is a little reluctant. "But, Wendy…"
	"Does Wendy still love Duke Field?"
	"Wendy says that she will give up Duke Field...Do you mean? Jamie Moore says. She suddenly understands the meaning of Dan William.
	If she tells this to Wendy, it would be the second hurt to her. If she tells this to Duke Field, it would bring a collapse of faith to him. Both would be the harm for them.
	"Shouldn’t we do something? Do you have any idea? "Jamie Moore wrinkles her nose.
	He must have an idea.
	Dan William sits back to the chair, and then he coughs lightly, “Do you want to know what I think?”
	"Yes, yes, yes!" Jamie Moore nods quickly. She walks to Dan William, and then she beats Dan William’s shoulder with expectation.
	"Let it be." Dan William narrows his eyes comfortably with a languid and casual attitude.
	What's the answer?
	Jamie Moore changes her expression suddenly.
	The sound of knocking the door raises. Then Dan William says, “Please come in."
	Secretary Sam comes in with a stack of documents in her arms, and she puts them on his desk. "Mr. William, this is the research report of spring and summer."
	Dan William nods, and then he says,“OK, you can leave now.”
	"OK." Secretary Sam takes a step back. She glances at Jamie Moore, and then she leaves the office.
	"What about your design?" Dan William looks at the report as he says.
	Jamie Moore shrinks her neck, “It’s almost finished, and I will go now!” then she opens the door and rushes out.
	...
	Time is like a fleeting, and it soon comes to the end of October. It’s the day that Jamie Moore needs to hand the finished design, and it’s also the engagement banquet for Harriet Chris and Jason Frank.
	After handing the design, Jamie Moore feels very relax. Thus she invites Wendy to shop with her.
	After hanging up the phone from Jamie Moore, Wendy meets Duke Filed in the bus station when she is waiting the taxi.
	Duke Field walks out from a bar, and he looks very bad. He walks over his Porsche in an unsteady way, and he doesn’t know where he should go.
	Wendy hesitates for a while, and then she follows Duke Field.
	Duke Field drinks too much alcohol. Wendy could smell the strong smell of wine on his body from distance.
	Why does he drink so much alcohol? Does he quarrel with Joey Lan?
	Suddenly, a car rushes out from the corner, but Duke Field even doesn’t dodge that car.
	"Be careful!" Wendy runs to hug Duke Field without any hesitation. And then she falls on the ground with Duke Field.
	"Don’t you have eyes?" The driver scolds hardly, and then he dives away.
	Wendy is also in a bad mood. Thus she picks up a stone, and then casts it toward the car. Then she claps her hands and stands up. Then she picks Duke Field up.
	"Are you OK?" Wendy picks him up, and she is a little nervous. She is afraid that Duke Field is injured.
	Duke Filed looks up, and then she looks at Wendy. Disappointment flashes in his eyes,“Are you Wendy?”
	“I am Wendy.” Wendy says repeatedly, and then she lets his hand go.
	Duke Field doesn’t say anything, and he looks very pale. He covers his stomach tightly, and it seems that he is very uncomfortable.
	Wendy knows that Duke Field has a stomachache.
	She remembers it clearly.
	Thinking herself ridiculous, she opens her bag. Then she takes out a bottle of stomach medicine and hands it to him. "It is better to take some medicine."
	Duke Field frowns, and then he says, “Do you have stomachache too?"
	The smile on Wendy’s face becomes stiff. She is always healthy. She knows that Duke Field has a stomachache, thus she takes this medicine with her all the time.
	"Yes, sometime I have a stomachache, and this medicine is very useful.” Wendy pretends that she is very relaxed. She unscrews the cap, and pours out some pills in the cap and hands them to Duke Field. "Here you are."
	Duke Field picks them without any hesitation. Usually, he never eats the food given by other people, but today he doesn’t refuse this.
	He puts the medicine on his mouth, and then he swallows it down.
	"Thank you." His throat is very dry, and his voice is very hoarse, but it’s warmer than usual.
	"You're welcome." Wendy’s heart jumps for a several times. Although she knows that she should not love Duke Field anymore, she can’t control herself.
	The atmosphere becomes silent suddenly. Duke Field leans against the street lamp with a touch of sadness on his face.
	Wendy bites her lips, and she feels that her heart is painful. Thus she asks, “Have you quarreled with Joey Lan?”
	She doesn’t know how to treat Duke Field coldly. She has been in this habit for several years, and she can’t get it off suddenly.
	Duke Field is a little embarrassed as if other people can read his mind. Then he looks at Wendy, “Do you know Joey Lan well?”
	Wendy presses her lips and then she ridicules. But since Duke Field asks this question, he must want to know something from her. Thus she answers, “Yes, I know.”
	"She refused my proposal. Do you know the reason?" Duke Field looks at Wendy with expectation.
	"Maybe she doesn't like the gift." Wendy says. Joey Lan loves Duke Field. What Duke Field gives is proposal gift. Except that Joey Lan doesn’t like this, she doesn’t know other reason about this.
	Duke Field murmurs, “Is there anyone else who doesn't like what belongs to her?"
	"You are going to engage, aren’t you?" The more Wendy thinks, the more strange she feels. She really doesn’t know the true reason. “Why did she refuse your proposal gift?"
	Why does Joey Lan refuse Duke Field?
	Duke Field nods,“Originally, she wants to refuse the engagement.
	Has the sun set to the south end? 
Chapter 290: Star of the Deep Sea.
	Wendy guesses that Joey Lan is too sentimental.
	Even though Joey Lan has refused him, he still want to have engagement with her. He loves Joey so much, and she even gets jealous of her.
	"Do you have conflict with Joey Lan?" Seeing that Duke Field is in a bad mood, Wendy continues to ask.
	"No." Duke Field closes his eyes slightly. He remembers the stun and disappointment of Joey Lan when she sees that thing.
	But when they meet again, she is very happy. Several years has passed, does she change to another person?
	"What did you send to her?"
	“Star of the Deep Sea.” Duke Field’s face becomes soft, and there is a smile on the corner of his mouth.
	The Star of the Deep Sea?
	Wendy is shocked. She loses the jewel on her bracelet accidentally in the past. How could it be in his hand?
	There is only one piece of the Star of the Deep Sea in the world. As for the identity of Duke Field, it's impossible for him to propose with fake things!
	"Where is it? Can I have a look?" Wendy says hurriedly. She holds the arm of Duke Field, and then she looks at him nervously.
	That gem is very important for her.
	Duke Field frowns. Then he knows why she is in a hurry after thinking for a while. All girls are knee on gems, is he right?
	He reaches out, and pulls out a silver chain from his neck. The Star of the Deep Sea is hanging on it.
	Wendy stares at the Star of the Deep Sea on Duke Field’s chest. It’s right. This is the Star of the Deep Sea. If one doesn’t look carefully at the middle of the gem, one will think the white in the middle is the reflected light.
	But Wendy knows that it’s a grain of rice, and her name is engraved on that rice.
	But why does he have the Star of the Deep Sea?
	"I send this to her as my proposal gift." Duke Field says in a hoarse way.
	What’s wrong with that?
	"Duke!"A sweet voice with some anxiety. Joey Lan runs to Duke Field. Then she pushes Wendy away, and holds Duke Field’s arms.
	"Why are you here? Have you drunk?" Joey Lan holds Duke Field’s arms, and then she says in an anxious way.
	The smile on Duke Field’s mouth become very soft, and then he looks at Joey Lan sweetly.
	"How do you know I'm here?" He holds Joey Lan in his arms affectionately, and there is no sadness on his face.
	"I see your car. I follow it, and then I find you. I also fall down for one time." Joey Lan purses her mouth, and then she puts her hand in front of him. There is a small wound on her delicate and white wrist. There is just a small scar.
	But Duke Field becomes nervous suddenly. He looks at Joey Lan worriedly, “What’s the matter? Does it hurt?”
	Joey Lan smiles sweetly. “I’m OK. Let’s go home now?”
	“OK. Let’s go.”
	"Well, Wendy, you're here, too. I don’t notice you just now." Joey Lan says in a surprised way, and her eyes are full of proud.
	Wendy just stands beside, and she looks at them indifferently. She feels very painful.
	It’s her who asks for this.
	This Star of the Deep Sea belongs to her. But Duke Field sends it to another woman.
	Wendy, you are so stupid. You even have expectation toward him.
	Wendy looks at the Star of the Deep Sea on Duke Field’s neck, and her eyes are full of sadness.
	Joey Lan also sees the Star of the Deep Sea through the eyesight of Wendy. Her face turns pale, and she looks at it in a resentful way.
	"Duke Field, let's go. It hurts now." Joey Lan says to Duke Field with a pale face, and then she leaves with him.
	Duke Field doesn’t ask more, and then he leaves with her.
	Wendy takes that gastric medicine out of her handbag. After several minutes, she walks to a trash can, and then she throws the medicine into it.
	What she insists on is a complete joke.
	The phone rings suddenly. It’s a call from Jamie Moore.
	Wendy answers the phone,“What’s the matter?”
	"I have something to do now, and I can’t go shopping with you now.” Jamie Moore’s voice comes from the other side of the phone. Her voice is full of anxiety, as if she is in a trouble.
	"OK, I haven’t been there yet. You could do your thing now. You'll treat me next time." Wendy says, "I'll hang up.”
	After hanging up, Wendy finds the phone number of Eddie Charlies in the number list, and then she gives a phone to him.
	...
	Jamie Moore is really in a big trouble.
	Originally, she has sent wedding dress of Harriet Chris and Jason Frank to them. But when they change their clothes, they find some threads of the wedding clothes had not been sewn. Thus the wedding dress is a semi-finished product.
	Of course, Jamie Moore needs to take the responsibility.
	There are many reporters in today’s wedding banquet. If this thing spreads out, Jamie Moore will lose her reputation. At that time, not only she can’t work in the CR, but also other company will not hire her.
	Someone recognizes Jamie Moore immediately when she arrives at the wedding banquet. And then they take her to the room where Harriet Chris and Jason Frank is.
	"Let me have a look at the wedding dress!" Jamie Moore says as soon as she walks into the room. The cold light flashes in her eyes. She orders as if she is queen.
	Harriet Chris and Jason Frank look at each other, and then they ask someone to take the wedding dress from the wardrobe.
	Jamie Moore picks the clothes up. She touches the wrong part carefully, and she even could feel the traces of stitches on it. She monitored the tailers to finish this clothes personally, thus it could not be a semi-finished product.
	"You have to give us an explanation for this." Harriet Chris walks toward her with disappointment. "Even if the design of the wedding dress is beautiful, it will lose its meaning if I can’t wear it.”
	Moreover, it's forebodes bad for their engagement.
	"Someone must have done something bad to this wedding clothes. I monitored them to finish this clothes personally, thus it’s impossible for this clothes to become such.” Jamie Moore presses her lips, and she looks at the wrong part of the clothes.
	Someone destroys the threads adroitly. If not for the pinholes, she would’ve not found this.
	This man must have a good knowledge of sewing. Maybe it’s done by someone in this industry. Who would do this?
	"What should we do now? The engagement banquet will begin soon. If you can't make it up, I will do something bad to you, and you should not blame us." Jason Frank says in a bad mood.
	Anyone will be unhappy, if he meets such bad thing in his own wedding banquet.
	It’s easy for the Frank Family and the Chris Family to cause trouble to Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore stares at the wedding clothes, and she presses her lips. She is also in a bad mood.
	She tries all her efforts to design this dress, and someone just destroyed it. How could she still in a good mood?
	Who did this? Only if she finds it out!
	Jamie Moore takes a deep breath. She picks up a wedding dress calmly, and then she says to Harriet Chris and Jason Frank, “Miss. Charis, Mrs. Frank, I can make it up now."
	Jason Frank snorts,“Make it up? Why should we trust you again?"
	"I lay my bet with my title of golden designer. How about this?" Jamie Moore says calmly, “If I can't give you an excellent engagement banquet today, I'll quit from CR automatically!"
	Hearing this, even Harriet Chris looks at her incredulously. 
Chapter 291: Are You Kidding Us?
	CR is a place where countless designers want to work in it.
	Even the older designers may not be able to let go of the glory easily.
	She is just a girl. How could she take this as a bet?
	“Are you kidding us?” Jason Frank asks incredulously.
	"You have no choice but to trust me now. I will give you an excellent engagement banquet!" Jamie Moore raises her chin slightly, and then she says in a confident way.
	Although she is young, the experience she owned is unmatched by ordinary people.
	Jamie Moore never does anything uncertain. She is confident, proud and arrogant, because she has her proficient competence.
	Harriet Chris hesitates. Jamie Moore has strong ability, and no one could deny this.
	If they have to choose and buy wedding clothes again, they don’t have enough time.
	Thus now they could only believe her.
	Jason Frank still wants to say something, but he is stopped by Harriet Chris. Harriet Chris looks at Jamie Moore, and then she says, “I hope we can have a perfect engagement banquet as you said."
	Jamie Moore nods lightly. She turns around, and she stares at the wedding clothes for several minutes. Finally, she pulls it hardly. With a hiss, the wrong part of the wedding clothes is pulled down by her!
	"Ah!" Harriet Chris shuts. She looks at the action of Jamie Moore in a surprised way. Then she covers her mouth and turns around. She dares not to see this.
	Although there is a socket in the wedding dress, she only needs to sew the off-line part with new string. If done well, it would still be a wonderful weeding dress. Now she tears it, Harriet Chris feels a little pity about the dress.
	What does Jamie Moore want to do?
	All the people in the room were confused after seeing the action of Jamie Moore.
	Does she make it up? Doesn’t she destroy the wedding dress?
	Jason Frank looks at the scene in front of him anxiously. He doesn’t believe Jamie Moore. If Harriet Chris never stops him, he will never let Jamie Moore do this.
	He wants to know what Jamie Moore could do. But he thinks that Jamie Moore pretends to be strong. In fact, she doesn’t have any idea.
	Jamie Moore ignores the strange eyes from others. She just tears up the damaged part of the wedding dress.
	Then she folds several rose shaped flowers with the damaged part of the wedding dress. Then she sews the rose flower on the wedding dress.
	She does all this quickly. She finishes it within a few minutes. And then she continues to finish the next one.
	After seeing Jamie Moore’s action, the eyesight of these people changes from disdain and disappointment to shock and disbelief gradually.
	Jamie Moore decorates the first wedding dress with rose flowers. The style of the second wedding dress is different from it. Although she just adjusts a little, the overall feeling is different.
	Harriet Chris has six sets of wedding dress today, and Jason Frank has three sets. Thus Jamie Moore must finish nine sets within one hour.
	The servant brings water, and put it on the table besides Jamie Moore. If Jamie Moore is thirsty, she could drink it immediately.
	Time passed quickly. There are only 15 minutes left for the start of the wedding.
	"Alright." Jamie Moore puts the needle well. Then she stretches out. Then she picks up the last wedding dress, and then nods contentedly.
	Although she does all of this in a hurry, the overall effect is OK.
	Looking at the wedding dress hanging on the hanger, Harriet Chris is very surprised. It’s just 45 minutes, and are these useless suits reborn again? "God, I can't believe my eyes."
	"Well, it's good." The expression on Jason Frank’s face finally eased a lot. Looking at these dresses, he nods contentedly. But suddenly, he says. "But you change all of these clothes on the original basis. Are you fooling us?"
	Jamie Moore tries all her effort to avoid rolling at him. The son of the Frank Family doesn’t forgive people easily, “Although I change all of these clothes on the original basis, aren’t you satisfied with the quality and style now?"
	"Jason Frank, stop talking now. I am satisfied with all of this. What’s more, Miss Moore changes all of these by herself. We don't have any actual loss, do we?" Harriet Chris smiles softly, and then she says considerately.
	Jason Frank stops talking anymore.
	Jamie Moore nods at Harriet Chris, and then she says calmly, “As for this thing, I will give you an explanation when I know all behind. Don't worry."
	"Didn't you do it? Otherwise why are you here?" Jason Frank still doesn’t believe Jamie Moore. He thinks it must be done by Jamie Moore. And now she comes here to pretend to be a warm-hearted designer to make it up.
	He hates this kind of woman. This kind of woman always uses this trick to attract attention, and then she is playing hard-to-get.
	Jamie Moore is speechless completely. Now she doesn’t have any good feeling toward Jason Frank. Why is this? Can’t he be just reasonable?
	She has tried all her effort to make it up. Is this all her fault? Even if they want to blame, they can’t blame this to her. Don’t they know that she is only responsible for designing, and not for making dress!
	Harriet Chris looks at Jamie Moore, feeling sorry. She hopes that Jamie Moore doesn’t mind this. Jamie Moore doesn’t care about this thing, but she will never do such a thankless thing again.
	Soon, the engagement banquet begins. Harriet Chris is taken to the dressing room by the makeup artists. After Harriet Chris leaves, Jason Frank whispers to the housekeeper. Then he looks at Jamie Moore, and leaves the room.
	Jamie Moore looks at them with confusion. Then a bad premonition rises in her heart suddenly... Sure enough, the housekeeper waves his hand, and then several servants walk out of the room. They stand at the door, and say, “Younger master will decide everything when the wedding banquet is over. So you should stay here during this time.”
	Then they close the door immediately after finishing their words.
	"It’s so terrible!" Jamie Moore presses her lips. She rushes to the door, but the door has been locked. She kicks the door hardly.
	They bully her, because she is a weak woman. What a bunch of villain!
	Jamie Moore thinks with her teeth clenched. She kicks the door with her foot. The door even shakes for a while, but she is still very angry.
	Is this the truth? She comes here to solve problem for them, and she even tries all her efforts to repair dress for them. Now even her hands are cramped for holding the needle for a long time. They don’t treat her politely——she doesn’t care about this.
	But now they lock her here as a prisoner! What do they want to do? Is it easy to bully her?
	Jamie Moore feels uncomfortable after getting angry for a while. She leans against the door, and sits on the cold ground. She hammers the door several times.
	She doesn’t make any trouble with Jason Frank in recent day. How could he treat her like this?
	Having got changed, Jason Frank walks to the wedding banquet. He stops when he sees two people walking toward him. Then he nods politely to that man, “Aunt William, you are coming. Welcome to my engagement ceremony."
	It’s Amelia and Mrs. William. At the moment, Mrs William is chatting in the hall with his business partners. They come here to see Jason Frank specially.
Chapter 292: Who?
	"Congratulations, you're going to have such a good wife." Mrs. William congratulates him with a graceful smile on her face.
	"Congratulations, brother Jason." Amelia smiles unexpectedly sincerely. She holds Mrs. William’s arms and then walks toward Jason Frank.
	"Thank you." Jason Frank nods, and then she looks at Mrs. William, “Aunt William, that woman is also at the engagement banquet now, but I've locked her up. What's your plan?"
	The smile on Mrs. William’s face becomes stiff. Then she asks with confusion, “Who?”
	"That is..." Jason Frank wants to say that it’s you who let me lock Jamie Moore here~! But he is stopped by Amelia.
	"Brother Jason, the ceremony is about to start. If you don't go, you would be late. Hurry up." Amelia is a little afraid, thus she stops Jason’s words naturally.
	Jason Frank looks at the watch, and then he finds time is up. Then he says goodbye to Amelia, and then walks to the front hall.
	Amelia relieves, but then she finds her mother looks at her suspiciously. Thus her heart jumps hardly.
	"What have you done behind me? And you even dare not let me know." Mrs. William looks at Amelia. She knows Amelia well, thus she finds Amelia hides something from her.
	"No, Mommy, you think too much. What can I do behind you?" Amelia denies quickly. In order to make herself look more natural, she is coquetting to her mother. If her mother knows this, everything would be bad.
	Seeing this, Mrs. William doesn’t ask more even though she is puzzled. “OK. Let’s go. Otherwise, your father will search us.”
	"Mom, I suddenly have a stomachache. You go to find daddy first. I want to go to the bathroom, and I'll be back soon. Would you like to go first, and wait for me there?” Amelia finally goes out with her mother, now she will not go back so easily. Thus she covers her stomach and looks at Mrs. William with an urgent look.
	Mrs. William is a little worried. She wants to pull her, “Have you eat something bad? Should I call the doctor for you? "
	"No, no. It’s just a stomachache. I will be OK after I go to the bathroom." Amelia waves to her mother, and then she goes to the bathroom.
	Mrs. William’s hand withdraws awkwardly.
	Amelia pretends that she is going to the bathroom. In fact, she goes to the room where Jamie Moore is. She has calculated it well with Jozo before.
	The William Family, the Frank William and the Chris Family have a good relationship. Amelia comes here with the reason that she is visiting the bride. Naturally, no one will doubt this. Thus it's convenient for Amelia to do something bad to Jamie.
	In fact, it’s Amelia who destroys the wedding dress. She loves playing with dolls since she is a child. Over time, she learns the craft and puts it into action.
	Amelia instigates Jason Frank in the name of Mrs. William. She asks Jason Frank to lock Jamie Moore here. Because she knows that Dan William has been on a business trip to the United States for two days, Amelia believes that no one would come to save her, so she locks Jamie Moore for two days. She will punish her badly to relieve the anger of Jozo!
	When Amelia comes to the door, she finds that she can’t open the door. The door is locked by someone.
	"It’s terrible. I forget the key from Jason Frank!” Amelia is very angry. She stares at the locked door, and then she claps her hand and walks away.
	Jamie Moore sits on the ground, and then she hears the knock on the door. She stands up suddenly, and then she claps the door hardly,“Is there anyone outside? Is there anyone outside?"
	But no one answers her after she knocks for a while. Maybe the man outside has left.
	She leans against the door. Then a light flashes in her mind. She has mobile phone!
	She is so stupid!
	She pats her brain, and then she walks toward sofa. She picks her handbag from the sofa. And she finds her mobile in it. But soon, terrible thing happens!
	She forgets to take her mobile! She forgets it!
	Ah. She walks out in a hurry, and she forgets to take her mobile!
	She feels very bad. Jamie Moore holds her handbag in a sad way. So modern people could forget everything, but they can’t forget to take her mobile!
	But she doesn’t want to give up in such way. Thus she throws her handbag on the sofa, and then she looks in the room. Maybe she could find other mobile phone in the room. Is she right?
	After searching the whole room for more than ten minutes, Jamie Moore doesn’t find anything in the room.
	Originally, she wants to get out through the window. But she doesn’t find any windows after searching. When the door is closed, this room is a closed space.
	If she is a mouse, everything would be OK. She can dig a hole in the wall.
	Now Jamie Moore knows the feeling--no one would answer her. Even though she is kidnapped before, Dan William is still there. And Dan William will find that she is gone.
	But now Dan William is not in the Country C. When other people finds out that she is missing, maybe she has been killed by the people in the Frank Family secretly.
	She needs to find a way...
	Then she stands up from the sofa. She waves her acid arms. She looks around, and she is looking for something.
	Suddenly, the whole room becomes dark, and all the light is turned off.
	Who turned off the light? Or something else must’ve happened?
	She suddenly has a bad feeling. Her heart jumps heavily, and she looks at the front without any goal.
	This room is a closed place. Now the light is out, and the whole room is very dark. She even can’t see her fingers in the room. Everyone would be in a panic in such a dark place.
	The room is very quiet and dark. It seems that something bad will happen. In fact, Jamie Moore knows that there is nothing, but she is still in a panic.
	She takes a few steps back, and then she stands at the corner of the wall. She squats down, and holds herself tightly. She presses her lips, and she even dares not breathe hardly
	Dan, where are you?
	She puts her face in the laps. She hugs herself so that she is not so afraid.
	...
	"Miss Jamie?" Secretary Sam knocks on the door of Jamie Moore's office, but no one answer her after he knocks for a while. Thus he tries to open the door, and the door is opened easily.
	There is no one in the room, and there are several pieces of semi-finished paper scattered on the desk. The screen of the computer is still open, and the computer is not turned off.
	Secretary Sam knows that Jamie Moore goes to the Frank Family. But it’s five o'clock in the afternoon. He should have solved the problem. Why hasn't she come back?
	Secretary Sam takes out her mobile phone, and then gives a call to Jamie Moore. But then she hears a ring coming from under those pictures. She walks to the table, and then she finds Jamie Moore’s phone is on the table.
	What's going on?
	Secretary Sam is shocked. She reminds what Dan William told him before leaving. He asks her to take good care of Jamie Moore. But now she even doesn’t know where Jamie Moore is... 
Chapter 293: The Gamble of Death
	Thinking of this, Secretary Sam gives a call to the driver who sends Jamie Moore to the engagement banquet. She realizes that this thing is not so simple.
	"Hello? Sam, have Miss Jamie come back? ...What? No? Where is Jamie Moore now? ...Doesn’t she walk out since she walked into the hall? OK. I know. "
	According to the words of the drivers, Jamie Moore doesn’t come out since she walks into the room. The driver doesn’t have an invitation letter, thus he can’t go into the hall. Thus he parks the car not far away from the hall. And he has waited for an afternoon.
	Secretary Sam gives a call to Dan William without any hesitation.
	The phone is answered soon, and then Dan William’s voice comes from the other side of the phone. He asks impatiently,“What’s up?”
	"Mr. William, today, the Chris Family and the Frank family give a call to Jamie Moore suddenly. They said that there is something wrong with our dress. Miss Moore goes to the banquet to make it up. But she hasn’t come back until now. I don't know if something bad has happened..."
	Now Dan William, who is in America, is discussing cooperation cases with customers in a hotel. In order to avoid being disturbed by unimportant news, he sets his mobile phone in a vibrate way. But he is worried about that something bad may happen to Jamie Moore, thus he puts his mobile phone in his pocket. In this way, he could answer the phone at the first time.
	"Are you sure that Jamie Moore hasn’t come back?" He says sorry to two American customers, and then he stands up and walks outside the hotel.
	"I'm sure. It’s the driver Sam who sends Miss Moore to the Frank Family. He doesn’t see that Miss Moore gets out of the Frank Family. I am afraid..."
	The expression on Dan William’s face becomes cold suddenly. She presses his lips and says, “Now you go to find Mr. Field and Mr. Hill. They should be at the banquet. It’s more important to find Jamie Moore first.”
	"OK, I see." Secretary Sam answers quickly, and then she relieves. The boss has taken his action, thus everything would be OK.
	Dan William puts his phone into his pocket. The atmosphere around him is very cold.
	"Derek William." Dan William turns around, and then he walks toward the hotel. "Let’s return back to China immediately."
	"Yes." Derek William walks out of the dark, and then he goes to buy tickets.
	...
	Hearing the order of Dan William, Secretary Sam sends someone to the Frank Family immediately. She has several invitation letters, and it’s sent to Dan William by the Frank Family.
	He walks forward with the invitation letter in her hand, and on one dares not stop him.
	At the same time, Jamie Moore squats down on the ground. When she is about to get stiffened, she hears the sound of dripping water suddenly.
	This kind of sound is very regular. It falls down and then drops to the ground, making a clear sound.
	The whole room is very quiet and silent. Thus the attention of Jamie Moore is attracted by the dripping sound. And all her mind is on the sound of dripping.
	But she doesn’t know that she is in the gamble of life or death.
	Then the interval of dripping suddenly prolongs.
	Jamie Moore focuses all her mind on the dripping. She could feel the changing sound of the dripping. She is very edgy. She wants to make the water drops faster, but she doesn’t know where the dripping is from. Thus she is very anxious.
	This feeling is very bad. It seems that the balance in her heart has been broken. It's more painful than you can’t get something you want.
	Jamie Moore is very uncomfortable. He begins to lose her sense, and she can only hear the sound of dripping.
	"Ah!" Jamie Moore mumbles. Then she covers her ears tightly. She could not hear it any more. The more she hears, the more fidgety she would be.
	Jamie Moore suddenly reminds something when she covers her ears. When she was in England, she has heard something from her friends majored in psychology.
	If you lock someone in a closed place, this man’s mind and nerves will be greatly hurt as the speed of the water drops slows down. The man will be unable to control himself to avoid hearing the sound. However, the man will be upset because the sound of dripping slows down. If this man is a heavy suffer, he may lose his life.
	The current situation of her is very pertinent.
	Jamie Moore thinks for a while. She can’t cover her ears all the time. Thus she takes out a package of paper towels from her pocket, and then rubs two balls, and puts it into her ears.
	After putting two balls in her ears, Jamie Moore finds the sound of dripping is obviously much smaller. Suddenly, Jamie Moore is relaxed a lot.
	Dan William, you baby is going to be killed by others. Do you know this?
	Jamie Moore leans back, and her bright eyes are full of confusion. It’s just like a light in the dark, which emits its last charming light
	-
	There are a lot of people at the venue. Secretary Sam spends a lot of time looking for Duke Field and Bruce Hill from the crowd. It’s already in the evening, and the engagement ceremony goes to the last step, so the scene is very lively.
	"Mr. Field, Mr. Hill, Mr. William asks me to ask you for help. The Frank Family takes Miss Moore away. And Jamie Moore hasn’t returned back the company. Mr. William is on the business in the United States. I need your help to deal with it first." As soon as Secretary Sam finds Duke Field and Bruce Hill, she explains her intention immediately.
	Joey Lan stands beside Duke Field, and Bruce Hill joins the banquet with a female star who is very popular recently.
	They look at each other, and then they put down the glass in their hand. At the same time, they loosen the hand of their partner, “So where is Jamie Moore?”
	"I don't know. But I’m sure that Miss Moore hasn’t come out since she walks into the Frank Family. She must still be in the Frank Family."
	"I see. We will solve this problem." Bruce Hill nods, and then they walk toward the place where Jason Frank and Harriet Chris are.
	Jason Frank and Harriet Chris are toasting when Duke Field and Bruce Hill walks toward Jason Frank. They put their hand on Jason Frank’s shoulder, and say, “Can I have a moment with you?”
	Jason Frank looks at them with confusion. Then he is taken away by Duke Field and Bruce Hill before he wants to say something. The people left behind all look at each other.
	"Have you take Jamie Moore away?" Bruce Hill always has a bad temple. When he hears that Jamie Moore is missing, he wants to find the woman for his good brother subconsciously. So he treats Jason Frank in an impolite way, and he asks viciously as he grabs Jason Frank’s collar.
	Duke Field doesn’t stop Bruce Hill. He just looks at it calmly with his hands crossed before his chest.
	"You...Mr. Hill, what did you say? Why should I take a woman away?” Jason Frank is a little frightened. Jamie Moore is just a designer. How could Mr. Hill and Mr. Field come here for finding her?
	Jason Frank has a feeling that he has done something wrong...
	"Are you sure? If we find Jamie Moore in the Frank Family, don't blame us for making trouble with you." Duke Field looks at him coldly, and he says in a threatening way.
	"You should think carefully before you answer this question!" Bruce Hill holds Jason Frank’s collar with one hand, and he holds his another hand highly, as if she is going to pouch Jason Frank’s face in the next second.
Chapter 294: Better to Take the Hint.
	Jason Frank’s face turns pale, and he is afraid of this. He doesn’t care about this, but he can’t get the whole Frank Family into trouble.
	In that case, Amelia and Mrs. William should not blame him.
	“I will take you there.” Jason Frank lowers his head, and then he says immediately.
	“Better to take the hint. Let’s go!” Bruce Hill withdraws his fists, and then he pushes Jason forward.
	Jason Frank leads the way in front. It's not far from the room where Jamie Moore is, so they walk to that room quickly.
	"Here it is." Jason Frank takes out the key from his pocket, and then opens the door.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field walks into the room immediately. It’s very dark in the room. Jason Frank turns on the light immediately. The whole room suddenly becomes bright.
	But they don’t find the figure of Jamie Moore.
	“Jamie Moore?” Bruce Hill shouts. Then he looks carefully in the corner of the room, but he doesn’t find Jamie Moore.
	"Where is Jamie Moore? It's impossible. The key is in my hand…” The key in Jason Frank’s hand falls on the ground suddenly. He remembers that Jamie Moore is in this room. How could she be missing?
	Duke Field looks at Jason Frank fiercely, and then he says coldly, “Do you mean that you hold the key in your hand all the time?”
	"Ha, are you kidding with us? You must have hidden Jamie Moore. Am I right?” Bruce Hill has a bad temper, thus he kicks Jason Frank’s knee immediately.
	This kind of person needs to suffer some difficulties!
	Jason Frank feels very pain after the kick. He bends his legs, and he even can’t straight his waist.
	"He is the only son of the Frank Family, so we should show some mercy to him. Don’t be an enemy of the Frank Family for this.” Duke Field stops Bruce Hill’s action, and then he says calmly, “Are you sure that you lock Jamie Moore here all the time?”
	Jason Frank tries all his effort to stand up, and then he nods.
	Duke Field frowns, and then he looks around in the room. Then he finds the red handbag on the sofa. It’s Jamie Moore’s handbag. There is an invisible puddle of water on the ground not far away from them.
	Where is the water from?
	Duke Field says to Jason Frank immediately,“Maybe Jamie Moore has been taken away by someone. Why do you lock Jamie Moore here? Who else knows it?"
	Jason Frank hesitates for a while. And then he finds there is something wrong. Thus he tells the truth to them,“It’s the Miss of the William Family—Amelia who asks me to do this. In the morning, she comes to visit me, and then she wants to look at my wedding dress. Then there is some problem with my wedding dress. Miss Amelia tells me that it’s the duty of Jamie Moore. Thus we called CR to complain.
	Then Jason Frank stops. After thinking for a while, he finds there is something wrong with this thing. Usually, the William Family doesn’t have much contact with the Frank Family. Why does Amelia come to visit him at this time? And she even visits him alone.
	Why does Mrs. William want to make trouble with Jamie Moore who is only a designer?
	Sure enough, it's not a coincidence. CR is very strict with the quality of their products, and they would not send semi-finished products to them. The clothes must be destroyed after they send the clothes to them!
	But he even gets trapped into the trap set by others! He even becomes an accomplice!
	"Go on, and tell all the things to us!" Bruce Hill stares at him impatiently in a very unpleasant tone. If Duke Field hasn't stopped him, he would beat this boy to death!
	"Miss Amelia asked me to lock Jamie Moore here. She told me that it’s the request of Mrs. William. When the wedding banquet is over, she will send Jamie Moore to the place where she should be."
	"Where is it?" Bruce Hill asks.
	“Miss Amelia doesn’t tell this to me.”
	"You!" Bruce Hill is in a hurry. He raises his hands, and he wants to beat him again.
	Duke Field stops the action of Bruce Hill immediately,“It’s more important to find Jamie Moore first. Even though you beat Jason Frank to death, there is no use. It's better to find Jamie Moore now."
	Bruce Hill withdraws his fists angrily, and then he goes to find Jamie Moore with Duke Field.
	-
	In November, the weather in City A is a little cold. A thin figure appeared at the exit of the airport. The man wears a black double breasted windbreaker. He walks out of the airport in a quick and steady way. It seems that he can’t wait for a second. He goes to Duke Field and Bruce Hill, who had been waiting outside for a long time.
	"Have you found Jamie Moore?" Dan William asks when he just walks in the front of them.
	Duke Field and Bruce Hill look at each other, and then they nod. Bruce Hill says in a heavy voice, "Brother, you should have preparation for this. One is the woman you love, and the other is you sister. What is your choice?"
	Dan William frowns, and the atmosphere around him is very cold. He asks hurriedly, “Where are they?”
	"On the hill of Mt.huai. We dare not to go up. We are afraid that Amelia will be stimulated by this, and then she will do something bad to Jamie Moore.” Duke Field answers.
	"I see." Dan William presses his lips. Then he pats on the shoulder of them and says, "Thank you."
	It's really a difficult choice. One is his sister, and one is the woman he loves. Dan William knows that there would be a war between Amelia and Jamie Moore sooner or later. But he doesn’t expect that Amelia would do such a bad thing to Jamie Moore at this time.
	…
	On the hill of Mt.huai.
	There is a white wooden house. It looks very warm and beautiful. But in fact, this house is shaking in the wind.
	The wooden house has only a door, even without a window. And there is only a dim light bulb on the wall.
	Amelia sits on the ground directly, and then she looks at Jamie Moore, who is bundled, with her hands around her chin.
	-
	"Amelia, you watch her for a minute. I'll come back soon." Jozo sits on the wheelchair, and then she says to Amelia. There is a phone on Jozo’s leg.
	Amelia nods at her, and then she agrees, “OK, you should come back quickly.”
	Jozo smiles, and then she walks out with her wheelchair, and then she leaves the wooden house.
	When Jamie Moore wakes up, she sees the leaving back of Jozo.
	Where is she?
	Jamie Moore wants to sit up, but her hands and feet are tied up. She can’t move anymore!
	Hum. She is not a crab. How is she tied up so easily!
	"Hum, you finally wake." A familiar voice sounds. Jamie Moore looks around subconsciously, and then she finds Amelia sitting beside her. Amelia looks at Jamie Moore coldly.
	“It’s you?”
	Isn't she in the Frank Family? How could she come to this place?
	Terrible! Jamie Moore shouts in her heart. When she was at the Frank Family, she wanted to sleep suddenly. And then she lost all her sense!
	If other people kidnap her, they may want money. But when the kidnapper is Amelia, she will lose her life at this time…
	Amelia doesn’t answer her. She just stares at Jamie Moore with hatred as if she is looking at a disgusting body.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and she finds there is something wrong with Amelia. She is too quiet now, and she looks very strange now.
	Jamie Moore wants to sit up, but Amelia pushes on her shoulder, thus she falls down on the ground again. Amelia looks at her in a gloating way, “You have today too!”
	"Amelia, you’d better send me back now. It’s true that your brother is in America now, but he will know the truth finally! If your brother knows this, do you think you can get rid of this thing? Jamie Moore doesn’t try to get up again after being pushed down. Anyway, even though she stands up, Amelia will push her down again. It's better for her to save some energy. 
Chapter 295: Bear Grudge
	Amelia snorts, and she doesn’t care about Jamie Moore’s words, “Of course, I know my brother is in America, and he is unable to get back in time. Even though he returns back in time, what will you be when he finds you?”
	Seeing Amelia’s cold eyes, Jamie Moore is a little frightened, and then she bites her lips.
	Amelia is right. Now Dan William is abroad. Even if she does something bad to her, everything will be late when Dan William finds her. And she's Dan William's sister after all. He won't do anything bad to her...
	"Please think Ian Moore. You are Ian Moore’s aunt. Do you hope that he lose his mother in such a young age?” Jamie Moore turns around hardly, but she only sees the stern skirt of Amelia.
	Hearing this, Amelia is a little indecisive. She loves Ian Moore. If Ian Moore loses his mommy in such a young age, is it too crucial for him?
	Does Jozo really want to do such a bad thing to Jamie Moore?
	Amelia struggles for a while.
	Jamie Moore relieves when she finds that Amelia is hesitating. Then she says, “You should know that if something bad happened to me, your brother would bear grudge to you. Do you want that?"
	“You don’t need to say good thing to me. Ian Moore. My brother. I know that you're just thinking for yourself." Hearing this Amelia stops Jamie Moore coldly, and then she stares at Jamie Moore with hatred.
	"Do you know why I hate you so much?"
	Jamie Moore’s eyelids trembles, and she doesn’t answer Amelia’s word. They had been so close with each other. She doesn’t know why they have such a bad relationship now.
	Amelia says, "When I was a child, I liked you more than my brother. You treat me better than my brother. You are willing to share everything with me."
	"Then one day, my best sister left me alone in the dark and humid warehouse. Do you know how scared I was, or did you worry about my feelings?"
	Amelia says calmly, and her voice is sharp in the quiet wooden house. She tells the hatred to Jamie Moore in a calm way. It’s so terrible.
	But Jamie Moore doesn’t understand Amelia’s words. When does she leave her alone in the warehouse? She doesn’t remember this!
	"Amy, what warehouse..." Jamie Moore presses her lips. She shouts at Amelia, and she want to figure out all the things.
	"Shut up, you don’t have any qualification to call me that." Amelia stops Jamie Moore. Then she turns around, and says, “It’s a place where there is no light. It’s very quiet. You must have felt it in the Frank Family, am I right?”
	"Is it you who arrange this?" Jamie Moore blurts out.
	Jamie Moore looks at Amelia in a shocked way. Something appears in her mind suddenly. That's the truth Why Amelia hates her so much several years ago.
	Amelia smiles like a demon,“You are right. It’s me. The dripping of water is also arranged specially for you by me. But these are less than one thousandth of what you gave me that time!"
	“I don’t know the warehouse you said just now!”
	Amelia glances at her, and then she pushes her hardly. Jamie Moore’s back hits on the ground, which causes aloud sound, “Jamie Moore, the biggest mistake you've done in your life is that you don’t find me."
	Amelia says in a trembling voice and sort of scare.
	"When I was nine years old, we were playing in the back of the school. I hid, but you didn't find me, and you went home directly." Amelia puts her hand on the neck of Jamie Moore, and it seems that she would strangle her at any time.
	At the age of nine?
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely. Yes. After that time, Amelia gradually alienates her, and soon the relationship between them broke.
	At that time, she couldn’t find Amelia when playing hide and seek with her. She thought that she had left first, so she went home directly.
	In the next day, when the William family sent someone to ask her about Amelia, she began to know that Amelia was missing. She looked for her with her family for a whole day, and then they find Amelia in the back mountain of the school. Amelia was weak because she didn’t eat food for a day. Fortunately, there was no danger. Everything was OK.
	Jamie Moore felt guilty for a long time and she took care of Amelia on end for two days. However, Amelia drove her out of the villa when she woke up.
	Since then, Amelia got agitated when she saw Jamie Moore. Thus Mr. William took her abroad to have a rest. She returns back to China three years later.
	After coming back, their relationship is not as good as before. Amelia didn’t anymore follow her around like before. Instead, she becomes an enemy of her.
	At that time, Jamie Moore’s mother and Jack Moore has divorced. Jack Moore married Celina Swift. Mia Moore becomes another daughter of the Moore Family. The whole life of Jamie Moore has changed.
	Even though Amelia always finds trouble with her, Jamie Moore never says this to others. After a long time, she knows that Amelia and she would never be as good as before.
	"I know it’s my fault that I didn't find you, but I want to make up for you. You didn't give me a chance, did you?" Jamie Moore says.
	"Chance! Do you think you deserve a chance?" Amelia sneers, and says, “If you really care about me, you won't let me stay in the warehouse alone for so long. No matter how hard I called you after you left, you didn’t come back."
	"If I hadn't tried my best to climb out of the window, I would’ve lost my life at that time!"
	Jamie Moore shivers when she hears the words of Amelia. At that time, when they found her, she was lying under the window of the warehouse. She had a high fever, and there were many cuts on her body.
	But they had searched the warehouse, but they didn’t find Amelia.
	It’s seems that Amelia has known the idea of Jamie Moore, and then she sneers, “You will not find this. I hide myself behind an old bookcase, and I can’t get out of it. Finally, I push the bookcase down, and then I get out of it."
	“Sorry.” Jamie Moore says with guilty. Although several years have passed, the guilt still left in her heart, and she can’t get rid of it.
	If she could be careful seeking her in the right place, everything would be different.
	It’s understandable that Amelia hates her. But she was only ten years old at that time, and Amelia , nine.
	"Sorry? Do you think you can remedy all the harm made with just a word? This damage will follow me in the whole life in the future.” Jamie Moore trembles. She looks at her hands with panic.
	She will never get rid of that nightmare in her life. She would wake up from her dream every midnight, as if she is still crying helplessly in that black warehouse.
	She doesn’t want to hate Jamie Moore. But she has nightmare every night. How can she not hate her? How can it be?
Chapter 296: The Pain I Have suffered
	"You should tell me what happened.” Jamie Moore bears the pain on her back, and then she sits up hardly. The intuition tells her that there must be something behind this.
	Amelia has hated her for so many years, thus the fact can't be so simple.
	"Do you want to know all the things?" Amelia puts down her hands, and then pain appears in her beautiful eyes, but she still raises her chin proudly.
	Jamie Moore nods, and then she says in a trembled way, “If you would like tell me all.”
	Then the door of the wooden house is opened suddenly. A man with a feminine face walks into the room, and then he says to Amelia, “Miss, another Miss ask me to tell you that you can leave now.”
	Another Miss? Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and then she has a suspicious object. Another Miss should be Jozo.
	No one would do this except Jozo.
	Seeing the man with a sly expression, Jamie Moore feels as if she is stared by a snake. She is very afraid of this. Does Jozo want to send her to this man?
	The words of Amelia are stopped by that man. Thus Amelia immediately loses interest in continuing the topic when another man is there. She stands up from the ground and says, "I know."
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore looks at them warily. Then she pulls her hand hardly, and she finds the rope is going to loosen.
	Jamie Moore is a little happy, but she still keeps calm. She looks at Amelia and that man calmly.
	Amelia snorts coldly,“You should stay here. And you should enjoy the pain I have suffered!”
	After saying this, she walks out with that man, and then she closes the door, and she even locks the room.
	"You should lock her there until tomorrow.” Amelia glances at that man. Then she walks down the mountain after finishing her words.
	Seeing that Amelia leaves, the man snorts at Jamie Moore. He looks at the sky, and then leaves the wooden house.
	Jamie Moore puts her ear to the ground closely, and she could hear the leaving steps of them clearly. After confirming that there is no one outside, she immediately sits up against the wall. She rubs her hand hardly, and she could feel that the rope is loose obviously. Then she increases her strength. Soon, she finally gets rid of the rope tied on her hand.
	Finally she could move her hand freely. Jamie Moore ignores the two red marks on her hand, and she begins to untie the rope that bound her feet.
	She stands up, and then she walks to the door quietly. Although there is no voice outside, it doesn’t mean that there is no guard outside the door.
	She holds the lock. As how she thinks, the door is locked from the outside.
	When she is in anxiety, the voice comes outside. Thus she hears the voice carefully.
	It's the sound of footsteps, and it’s heavy and powerful. It's not like the step of Amelia. It should be the step of that man.
	It seems that he is walking around the wooden house, and there even has a sound of watering.
	What did he do?
	The heart of Jamie Moore jumps heavily. She dares not to take breath heavily, and she is afraid that the man outside will notice her. She is very nervous, and sweat begins to appear on her white forehead.
	What is it? Jamie Moore feels bad. Does this smell like…gas?
	When she gets her sense, she walks to the door, and kicks the door. The gas around the wooden house has been ignited and the whole wooden house is wrapped in it.
	God. Do they want burn her?
	Jamie Moore never expects that Amelia would hate her so much. She even wants to kill her.
	The fire spreads quickly, and the fear of death spreads around the wooden house.
	…
	Amelia walks down the path. When she reaches the mountainside, there would be a car to pick her up. So she stands on the side of the road and waits the man.
	A black Maybach comes to her slowly. Amelia has waited for a long time, thus she is a little impatient. When the car stops in front of her, she scolds immediately, “You are so slow. Are you a turtle?"
	The window falls down slowly, and a handsome face appears in front of her. But the man, who sits in the car, stares at her coldly.
	Amelia’s face turns pale, and then she takes a few steps back. She looks at the man in the car in a surprised way, “Bro…Brother…?”
	"Brother, is there on fire?" Bruce Hill looks at the top of the mountain. At this moment, the fire and black smoke on the top of the mountain are ferocious.
	Dan William frowns, and then he opens the door, and dashed to the top.
	Duke Field and Bruce Hill also get off the car, and then they follow behind Dan William. They walk over Amelia who has a pale face.
	"How was it on fire?" Amelia looks at the fire through the trees. She knows clearly that it’s the wooden house. Why is the wooden house on fire? She doubts.
	Dan William walks through the forest quickly, and he murmurs in his heart.
	Jamie Moore, you should be fine, and you should be definitely fine!
	The mountainside is not far from the top of the mountain. What’s more, Dan William climbs quickly.
	The situation of the wooden house is very serious, and Jamie Moore doesn’t want to die here. She tries all her efforts to get out of here. The thick smoke keeps coming into her nose, which hurts her throat. Thus tears keep falling down from her eyes.
	She is wrapped by the fire. She stands alone in the middle of the wooden house. No matter where she goes, it’s a dead road.
	Dan, Dan, where are you?
	Jamie Moore sniffs and then she takes a strong breath of the fresh air. Then she covers her nose immediately. She is very uncomfortable for the feeling of burning. The whole person seems to be thrown into the fire, and then she will be killed in such a way.
	All of a sudden, the wood of the house on the top is cut off by the fire and falls down.
	Jamie Moore rolls to one side quickly. Finally, she dodges the falling wood.
	She knows that as long as one piece of wood falls, there would be the second and the third one.
	Originally, this wooden house is not strong, now the wooden house becomes more dangerous.
	Jamie Moore is trapped in the middle. She can only see the fire reaching to her.
	A piece of wood on the top of the head is burning, and then that wood hits towards Jamie Moore after swaying a few times in the air.
	"Jamie!" A figure breaks into the fire. Seeing that the burning wood is going to fall, rushes toward Jamie Moore without any hesitation.
	Jamie Moore also finds that broken wood, but she doesn’t have any strength to dodge it. She almost can’t open her eyes.
	When the wood is about to hit on her body, she is hugged into a warm arms suddenly. And she even could hear the strong heart beating of this man.
	The man groans, and then the wood fall to the ground. The wood rolls on the ground, and then it continues to burn.
	Who? Who saves her?
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and she tries all her efforts to see the man in front of her. Finally she sees the man in front of her, and then she looks at the man in a puzzled way.
	The sweat falls from the man’s handsome face, and then fall on her face. It burns. 
Chapter 297: Are You OK?
	"Dan..." Jamie Moore is moved. She puts her hand on Dan William’s shoulder, and she is very calm at this moment.
	"Let’s leave here first." Dan William holds Jamie Moore in his arms. Dan William’s face is very pale, but no one could find it under the light of the fire.
	Jamie Moore stays close to Dan William, and then she leaves with Dan William.
	The broken wood keeps falling to the ground. Jamie Moore leans against Dan William, thus she could avoid being hit by the falling timber.
	"Hold on to me tightly." Dan William takes Jamie Moore to the shaking door. Then he takes off his coats, and holds Jamie Moore in his arms, and then he covers Jamie Moore with the coat tightly.
	Jamie Moore lies on Dan William’s arms, and tears fall from her eyes.
	Dan William hugs Jamie Moore tightly, and then he rushes out of the door.
	As soon as they rush out, the wooden house collapses completely. The fire becomes more and more serious. Fortunately, there are no trees around the house, thus the fire doesn’t spread too wide to the around.
	Dan William rushes out with Jamie Moore in his arms. The wound on his back hurts his nerves. He almost falls to the ground. But he knows Jamie Moore lies in his arms. If he falls down in such way, he will press Jamie Moore definitely. So he tries his best to turn himself over before falling down, so that he won't hurt her by the stone on the ground.
	However, Dan William’s back is pressed on the sharp stone, but he doesn’t hum.
	Then Jamie Moore looks at Dan William, and asks.
	“What the matter? Are you OK?”
	Jamie Moore is protected by Dan William so well, but the windbreaker wrapped in her body is burned. She takes it off, and then she gets up from him.
	“I am OK.” Dan William murmurs.
	Dan William still worries about Jamie Moore. He sits up with one hand on the ground. Then he checks the wound on her body.
	He relieves when he finds that there is no other wound on her body except for some small burns.
	"You're hurt!" Jamie Moore finds the wound on Dan William’s body for the action of him. “I will help you stand up, and let’s go to the hospital." Jamie Moore’s eyes are a little red at the moment, and then she says.
	His clothes are burnt out. The burn marks are obvious, and some place on his body is very serious. He looks very awkward, but he is still dignified as usual.
	He is a true nerd. In order to protect her, he is hurt so badly. Has he ever thought of himself?
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he loosens his hand, “No, Duke Field and Bruce Hill will come up soon. They will help me when they arrive. You've just been smoked for so long. Don't move."
	Now he can’t take her down the mountain himself.
	"But the wound on your body is festering..." Jamie Moore presses her lips, and her eyes are full of worry.
	If these wounds are not treated early, he will get serious sequelae!
	"No hurry for me."
	Dan William says coldly. He frowns hardly as if he could shoulder the whole world’s misery on his own..
	Jamie Moore gnashes her teeth, and she gets upset for his stubbornness. But when she sees the wound on Dan William’s body, she couldn't help but get soak in sorrow.
	"I don't care. You have to go to the hospital with me now!" Jamie Moore says firmly. She pulls the arms of Dan William, and gets him up.
	Dan William is held up by Jamie Moore before Dan William gets his sense. This action hurts the wound on his back. Dan William presses his lip, and then he looks at Jamie Moore as if nothing has happened.
	"Brother!" At this time, Bruce Hill and Duke Field also arrive. They run to Dan William and Jamie Moore, and then look at them nervously.
	"We're OK, and let’s go back first." Dan William says lightly.
	Bruce Hill and Duke Field relieve after hearing this. They support Dan William on the both side. There is a shortcut here. It takes less than half an hour for them to get to the road. The black Maybach is very conspicuous, and one can see them in a moment.
	After helping Dan William get on the car, Jamie Moore sits beside him immediately.
	"Brother, what are you going to do with this?" Bruce Hill is driving. He looks at Dan William, who is having a rest, from the rearview mirror, and then he asks.
	Duke Field sits on the passenger seat. He looks aside, and listens carefully. He also wants to know what Dan William will do.
	"Except Amelia, deal the others as you like. You don’t need to ask me.” Dan William says coldly, but he still closes his eyes tightly.
	This sentence is enough to show his standpoint. They can't do something bad to Amelia, but he can.
	Jamie Moore looks at the side face of Dan William in surprise. She thinks that he would let Amelia go, but he…
	The car arrives at the manor quickly. Dan William opens his eyes as soon as the car stops. He opens the door, and walks into the room without waiting Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore is a little shocked. She gets off the car immediately and then follows behind Dan William.
	Dan William walks in to the bathroom as soon as he gets into the bedroom. Jamie Moore will not kick the door to see him in the bathroom. After all, he needs a shower.
	Jamie Moore finds out how bad the smell of smoke is. She walks to the cloakroom to get her clothes. She wants to take a shower after Dan William comes out.
	15 minutes later, when Jamie Moore almost falls asleep on the sofa, Dan William finally walks out of the bathroom.
	He has changed, and the whole body of him emits a light mint fragrance. There is no strong smell of smoke around him. One could keep his mind clear after smelling this.
	He takes out a new suit and wears a tie of the same color. Then he keeps his cool and dignified image as usual.
	Jamie Moore rubs her eyes, and then looks at Dan William. She is surprised when she finds Dan William wears a new suit. She says hurriedly,“You are hurt, and I will fetch the medicine for you!”
	She stands up to fetch the medicine as she says, but Dan William stops her, “There is no need to take medicine, and it’s just a small wound.”
	Jamie Moore turns around and looks at him reluctantly. He dresses himself so well. Does he want to go to the company?
	"Are you going to the company now?" Jamie Moore is perplexed. He just returns back to China, and he is also injured. Doesn’t he need to have a rest?
	Dan William buttons his cufflinks and replies lightly, "Yes, there is a meeting at one o'clock. I have to go there."
	He leaves the bedroom after saying this. Jamie Moore presses her lips unhappily, and then she walks into the bathroom.
	After washing with body shampoo for three times, Jamie Moore can't smell the irritating and pungent smell on her body finally. She walks out of the bathroom as she rubs her hair with a tower.
	When she walks at the door, she finds the paper towel stained with blood in the trash bin beside the washstand.
	She puts down the towel and bends down to pick up a paper. The blood on it is still wet, so it must be thrown into it just now.
	Is there other wound on Dan William’s body?
	But the burn area on his body is not very serious. How could there be so much blood? 
Chapter 298: What are you laughing at?
	Jamie Moore is puzzled, and then she walks out of the bathroom hurriedly. She sees Cindy Swift as soon as she walks out of the door.
	Cindy Swift is taking the medicine for her. Seeing that Jamie Moore walks out of the room, she smiles at her, “Miss Moore.”
	“Cindy Swift.” Jamie Moore walks to Cindy Swift. She looks at the medicine on the table, and all of them are expensive.
	"Young master told me that you are burned. He asks me to bring this medicine to you.” Cindy Swift picks up one of the medicine as she says, “Let me help you apply it!"
	Jamie Moore feels happy in her heart, and she also complains in her heart. She holds all the medicine to her breast. She even takes the disinfectant water and cotton swab away. She wears a pair of sneaker randomly. Then she runs out of the room with wet hairs.
	"Miss Moore, you should apply it first..." Cindy Swift shuts behind Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore ignores the words of Cindy Swift.
	Dan William is such a fool man. He must have been hurt but he doesn’t want her to know it, thus he treats her so indifferent. So he comes to the company. If she doesn’t find the tower paper in the trash can, she wouldn't know that he is hurt so badly. Is she right?
	He saved her just now. He must been hit by that falling wooden. At that time, she hears the muffled voice of him. She is so stupid, and she even doesn’t notice this!
	Jamie Moore, you are so stupid!
	…
	In fact, Dan William takes the meeting as an excuse. He just doesn’t want Jamie Moore to worry about it, so he doesn’t tell her.
	The wound on his back is still bleeding, but Dan William ignores all of this. He still looks at the document in front of him with the same posture.
	He doesn't care about this. The wound will recover in two days. He's too lazy to go to the hospital or use medicine. He lives his life in such way all the time—— he does not like to go to the hospital so often.
	Of course, it’s hurts so bad. He could only sit with the same posture. If one touches the wound, there will be blood on his hand.
	The black shirt on his body has been soaked in blood. His lips become pale. He looks very bad now.
	Bang!
	The door of the president's office is open with a loud noise.
	Dan William looks at the direction of the door. When he sees Jamie Moore walks into the room with anger, his heart stops.
	"What are you doing?" Dan William coughs and then he looks at her calmly.
	Jamie Moore walks to Dan William hurriedly. Her face is drawn with anger. She holds several bottles of medicine in her arms, and then she looks at Dan William seriously.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore doesn’t speak anything, Dan William presses his lips. Then he says, “Now it’s time for work. If you want to say something to me, let’s talk about it at home.”
	Jamie Moore still doesn’t say anything. She just stares at him in a stubborn way.
	Then she walks to Dan William. Then she does an amazing move.
	Sizzling--
	She stretches out her hand to tear the black shirt on Dan William’s body. She never thinks that she would have such great strength. When she sees the ferocious wound on his white back, her heart even stops at the sight.
	Jamie Moore stares at that wound, and she feels it’s hard for her to breath. Her heart aches, and it’s so painful that she can’t say anything.
	Dan William never expects that Jamie Moore would do such a domineering and direct thing. She stares at him in such a direct way, thus he blushes.
	He clears his voice, and he tries to pull his shirt down. But Jamie Moore's strength is so great that he doesn’t have a chance to pull his shirt down.
	“You are hurt. Why don’t you tell me? Are you a kid? If I don’t find this, will you keep yourself in such way? Wouldn’t you apply the medicine and see the doctor? Dan William, are you a kid?” Jamie Moore looks at the wound on Dan William’s back, and she gets so angry.
	Why doesn’t he pity his body? He is hurt, but he doesn’t tell her, and he even doesn’t want to let her know.
	Dan William is shocked. Hearing the scold of Jamie Moore, Dan William feels very sweet, and he is almost wrapped by the sweet. And even the pain in his back is not so obvious.
	Jamie Moore looks at Jamie Moore, and then he smiles. His eyes are full of moving light.
	Jamie Moore stares at him,“What are you laughing at?”
	Jamie Moore pulls him over after finishing her words. She takes out the disinfectant and wipes it on his wound with a cotton swab, "You should bear with it."
	Dan William is very cooperative now. He doesn’t refute her words, and he doesn’t drive her away. He is very obedient now.
	Jamie Moore disinfects him carefully, and then she wipes the blood and puts on the wound with a cotton swab, and then she applies the medicine for him.
	When Jamie Moore applies the cold medicine to the wound, Dan William feels more comfortable than before.
	The wound on his back is very big. Jamie Moore serves it with a whole piece of ointment. She picks his arms without any hesitation. Then she rolls his sleeve up. She remembers that there is also a wound on his arm.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore, who is applying the medicine for him, quietly. His eyes are full of love, so he just looks at her.
	Jamie Moore's hair is still wet, and there is still water dripping down from her hairs. Dan William frowns when he sees Jamie Moore’s hair still wet, “How could you run out with wet hair?"
	Jamie Moore answers as she is doing all this,“I forget because I want to see you first.”
	Hearing this, Boss William is happier than before. But he still says, “You should not do this next time.”
	“…” Jamie Moore doesn’t answer him, and she continues her med work.
	Jamie Moore finally stops when she runs out of the second piece of medicine. She looks at Dan William with a smile after arranging his sleeves well.
	Jamie Moore narrows his eyes, and then he pulls Jamie Moore to his arms,“Medicine.”
	"What are you going to do?" Jamie Moore hands the ointment to him with confusion.
	Dan William glances at her, and then he opens the ointment. He takes out a cotton swab, and pulls down the clothes on Jamie Moore’s shoulder.
	"What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore’s face turns red, and she stares at him, puzzled.
	She shouldn’t have come here to medicate him. He is hurt, but he still wants to do something bad to her!
	In fact, Dan William does all of this in a gentle way. After all, he doesn’t tear her clothes up. He just pulls down the clothes on her shoulder.
	Jamie Moore just wears a white shirt after taking a shower. The weather has turned cold, but the weather in autumn is still well. It’s not cold or hot, and it’s very comfortable.
	So Dan William just pulls gently, thus the white skin of Jamie Moore appears in front of him.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore’s face turns red, Dan William is amused. After seeing her shoulder and arms, Dan William says, “Haven’t you use the medicine?”
	“I forget…” Jamie Moore’s face is very red. She purses her lips. What she thinks is the wound on his body, thus she forgets to wipe the medicine.
	What’s more, compared with the wound on Dan William’s body, she is OK. Dan William is much severer.
	Dan William reaches out to flip the forehead of Jamie Moore,“Silly girl.”
	
Chapter 299: We Can't Blame This Entirely on Her.
	Then he applies the ointment to the wound on her shoulder. He does all of this gently, and he sooth her wounds with gentle breath from time to time. He serves her exclusively nice.
	Jamie Moore feels warm when she feels the cool effect on her shoulder. She raises her lips happily, and she smiles in a silly way.
	"What are you laughing at?" Dan William glances at her after applying the ointment for her. Then he tidies up her clothes. Then he stands up, and walks to the rest room. He takes a clean towel and changes a new shirt.
	The clothes on his body has been torn up by Jamie Moore, thus he can’t walks out of the office with it.
	"Dan, are you afraid that I will be worried when I see your wound? So you stay away from me." Jamie Moore sits in Dan William’s chair in the office, and then she says in a good mood.
	This office chair is custom-made, so it's big. It's suitable for Dan William to sit on the chair. But Jamie Moore is small. When she sits on the chair, she looks like a child.
	She waves her legs in the air mischievously.
	Dan William doesn’t answer her. Instead, he walks to the front of Jamie Moore, and dries her hairs with the towel.
	Seeing that Dan William doesn’t answer her, Jamie Moore knows that this is the truth. Thus she laughs as if she is a sly little fox.
	"I'll give you an account of this thing." Dan William says in an apologetic way as he is drying her hair.
	Jamie Moore smiles happily, and she shrugs her shoulder. Then she pulls the clothes of Dan William, “Don’t make trouble with Amelia. This is what I owe her, and we can't blame this on her entirely."
	Jamie Moore reminds the words that Amelia says to her in the wooden house. Then guilt hidden in her heart rises again.
	She is a little tired now. She is nerves before, thus she doesn’t have time to think about this question. Now the crisis has finally been relieved, thus she can feel the tiredness now.
	Dan William doesn’t ask more when he finds the tiredness on Jamie Moore’s face. Thus he walks to the rest room with Jamie Moore in his arms.
	He puts her in the rest room. There is a big bed in it. He takes her shoes off, and then he also lies on the bed.
	Jamie Moore turns over, and then she stays close in his arms. She could feel the warmth from his chest. Then she closes her eyes, and falls asleep quickly.
	When Dan William heard that Jamie Moore was in danger, he returned China immediately, thus he didn’t have time to have rest. Now when he finds Jamie Moore falls asleep, he also closes his eyes, and falls asleep with her.
	Night comes soon. The shades outside is very dim. It’s eight o’clock now.
	Jamie Moore wakes up first. After having rest for several hours, she feels much better now.
	She looks around, and then she finds this is the rest room of Dan William.
	Then she finds that there is an arm press on her chest, and she even can’t breathe smoothly. She opens her eyes. No wonder that she can’t breathe smoothly when she sleeps. It’s for this hand!
	Jamie Moore purses her lips. She looks at the hand on her chest, and she is speechless. Does he want to do something bad to her when she is in sleep?
	She picks the hand of Dan William up, and then moves it away. Then she rolls to the bedside and sits up.
	"Hiss-" Jamie Moore feels so pain when she touches the wound on her body. She doesn’t feel pain before she falls asleep. Why does she feel pain after sleeping?
	"What's the matter?" The magnetic voice sounds behind her, and the voice is full of worry.
	Dan William picks Jamie Moore’s arms up, and then he looks at the wound on her hand. There is no purulence on the wound after using the ointment. Although it looks bad, the situation is getting better.
	"I'm hungry." Jamie touches her little belly. She feels hungry now, and she should eat something delicious now.
	Dan William rubs her hair, and then he stands up. Then he takes Jamie Moore out after neatening their clothes.
	Dan William asks when they walks out of the CR, “What do you want to have?”
	"I want to eat at home.” Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she licks her lips. She wants to eat delicious food immediately.
	"Wait." Dan William walks toward the underground parking lot after finishing his words. Jamie Moore walks to the intersection, and waits for Dan William there.
	The wind of the night is cool, and Jamie Moore only wears a single garment, so she feels a little cold, thus she holds her arms tightly.
	At this time, a man walks over in front of her, and Jamie Moore is attracted by this man.
	This man wears a black coat, and the golden hair is exposed to the air from the brim of his hat. What’s more, he also wears a pair of huge sunglasses, thus Jamie Moore could not see the face of this man clearly.
	Jamie Moore focuses her eyes on this man. At the same time, this man also looks at Jamie Moore. Seeing that Jamie Moore is looking at him, this man says a few words with a smile.
	What…is that?
	Jamie Moore looks at the leaving back of that man in a puzzled way. A familiar feeling appears in her heart. But what did he say just now?
	It seems that he didn’t speak in Chinese. According to the hairstyle of this man, he should be a foreigner. Is she right? So what language would that be?
	When Jamie Moore wants to translate the words of this man, the car of Dan William stops in front of her, “Get on the car.”
	She opens the door immediately, and then sits in the passenger seat.
	Jamie Moore wants to know the meaning of the words said by that man, and she wants to translate this words.
	She tries to translate with English, but then she finds it’s not English.
	"Love you, my baby!" Jamie Moore tries to says that words out with French, and then she finds that it’s right!
	She presses her lips. The handsome foreign men are so open. They can show their love directly when they see a girl on the road.
	"What did you say?" Dan William looks at Jamie Moore with confusion. Then he turns around to look at the road in front of him.
	"Nothing." Jamie Moore answers casually. She doesn’t think this kind of thing is very important. She just meets a foreign handsome man, and nothing has happened. If she tells all of this to Dan William who is jealous man, he will punish her heavily.
	-
	In the manor, when Jamie Moore gets off the car, she goes to the dining room with Dan William. But she never expects that she would meet Amelia, Mrs. William and Mr. William here.
	Amelia sits between Mrs. William and Mr. William nervously. Now she looks different from the arrogant and casual appearance in the past.
	She glances at Jamie Moore when she finds Jamie Moore walks into the room with Dan William. Then she lowers her head nervously, and she dares not to see Dan William.
	Dan William frowns, and then he says,“Daddy, Mommy.”
	"Sit down." Even though time goes by so quickly, the majestic momentum of Mr. William has not diminished at all. The expression on his face is also very cold, and no one could know his true feeling. But other people all are afraid of this.
	Mrs. William, who sits beside Mr. William, is elegant and noble. Time has not left any trace on her face. She always keeps a proper smile on her beautiful face. She looks like a noble woman from top to toe.
Chapter 300: 300: You Are so Sweet.
	"Hello, Mr. William, Mrs. William." Jamie Moore stands beside Dan William, and she greets them in a polite way.
	Mr. William nods at her, and then he smiles at her.“Is this Jamie Moore? I haven't seen you for several years. Now you are more beautiful than before."
	"Mr. William, I haven't seen you for several years, and you are more handsome than before. Jamie Moore is never stingy about praising people that she loved. She is so sweet, and Mrs. William is very happy after hearing Jamie Moore’s words.
	“You are so sweet. Sit down quickly.” Mr. William says with a smile.
	He has different ideas from Mrs. William, and he keeps silent about Jamie Moore and his son. He believes his son, thus he would not treat her like Mrs. William did. He would not hate anyone for behind talking.
	Sometimes, men and women have different ideas.
	Jamie Moore sits with Dan William. Dan William pinches Jamie Moore’s hand hardly. She feels very pain, thus she wants to pinch it back. But Mr. William and Mrs. William is here, thus she bears with this.
	How could he do this under the table?
	Mrs. William and Amelia don’t say anything, and they just sit quietly.
	"Mother, Father, what brings you here? What’s the matter?" Dan William crosses his legs habitually. He presses his lips and narrows his eyes.
	Today, Mrs. William doesn’t make trouble with Jamie Moore. And she even doesn’t say something bad to Jamie Moore when Jamie Moore walks into the room. She pulls the hand of Amelia, and then says to Dan William.
	"Dan, it's Amelia’s fault today. Your father and I have punished her heavily. Are you willing to forgive her?"
	Dan William’s eyes becomes cold gradually, “Forgive her? You should give me a reason to forgive her."
	“Amelia is still young, and it’s not her who set the fire. She makes this mistake because she heard other people’s words. She is your sister. You don’t help her, then you would’ve helped others, don’t you?
	Mrs. William even stares at Jamie Moore after finishing her words. Her words have other meanings.
	"Mom, you mean that though she wants to kill someone, I should hand her a knife, right?" Dan William looks at Amelia with a touch of disappointment coldly.
	Hearing Dan William’s words, Amelia is a little uncomfortable. She doesn’t do this on purpose, and she doesn’t know that the wooden house would catch fire suddenly. Does this mean that Jamie Moore is unlucky?
	But now Amelia doesn’t care the idea that who is more important in Dan William’s heart. She knows this clearly after returning China. What’s more, Jamie Moore has Ian Moore, and she has done so many things to Dan. Thus Dan William must hate her very much.
	The expression on Mrs. William’s face changes suddenly. She looks at Dan William reproachfully. She says with a hint of disapproval. "How could Amelia kill others? You are her brother. Shouldn't you believe her?"
	After stopping for a while, Mrs. William continues to say. “You don’t believe your sister. Instead, you believe other people. You…”
	"Mother," Dan William stops the words of Mrs. William unhappily. The atmosphere around him is very cold, “Jamie Moore is not an outsider. I will marry her in the future."
	Um?
	Jamie Moore is thinking about the food she wants to eat. Hearing the words of Dan William, Jamie Moore is thrilled. What did he say just now?
	Does he want to marry her?
	He tells his parents that he wants to marry her, right?
	Although Jamie Moore doesn’t care the marriage of Dan William and her, and she even never thinks about this, Dan William confirms her identity in front of his father and mother suddenly. That is to say, he really wants to live with her, and he is not kidding with her.
	However, when Jamie Moore reminds the word of marriage, she feels that she doesn’t prepare for it well. Thus she is at a loss.
	Mrs. William looks at Dan William in a shocked way. She can’t keep the elegant image of her now. Anyway, here doesn’t have any outsiders except Jamie Moore, thus she doesn’t need to care so much, then she says, “Do you want to marry her? It’s impossible. I don't agree with this!"
	"I just inform this to you, and I don’t ask suggestion from you. Even though you don’t agree, I will marry Jamie Moore.” Dan William compresses his lips, and he says calmly.
	He will marry Jamie Moore sooner or later. He has waited for her for so many years. Finally, they fell in love with each other. So he wants to marry Jamie Moore, and he will never give up.
	Except that Jamie Moore doesn’t want to marry him.
	"You!" Mrs. William is very angry, but she can’t do anything to him. She can’t punish him casually like he is a child. Isn’t it?
	What’s more, Dan William never listened to her even when he was a child. He never did that.
	Mrs. William can’t do anything to her son, thus she could only ask for help from Mr. William.
	“Do you want to marry Jamie Moore?” Mr. William asks.
	Dan William doesn’t answer, but he nods. He holds Jamie Moore’s hand tightly to give her strength.
	"I agree, but I have a condition." Mr. William looks at Dan William and Jamie Moore sincerely.
	Mrs. William looks at Mr. William in a shocked way. How could he agree to this?
	It seems that Dan William knows the condition of Mr. William. He keeps calm, but he refuses, “I have told you that even though you don’t agree with this, I will marry her. You can’t set condition with me.”
	Jamie Moore looks at Dan William. She doesn’t expect that Dan William would do this for her.
	Today, Mr. William and Mrs. William come here to beg for Amelia. The condition of the Mr. William is that Dan William should not make trouble with Amelia.
	In her eyes, Mr. William doesn’t oppose the marriage of Dan William and her. By the way, he will set this condition.
	“Dan.” The face of Mr. William changes, “You should think it carefully.”
	Dan William narrows his eyes. He could see the warning in his father's eyes, but he doesn’t care about this.
	"I need to work now. If you have nothing to do today, you can go back first." Dan William walks upstairs with Jamie Moore after finishing his words.
	Amelia cries in Mrs. William’s arms after Dan William and Jamie Moore walks upstairs. “Mommy, what should I do? Brother gets angry now.”
	Mrs. William is also in a bad mood. She is upset after hearing the crying of Amelia. But she still comforts Amelia, “Nothing. Now your brother is very angry. Everything would be OK when he is not angry.”
	With the guarantee of Mrs. William, Amelia feels much better.
	But when she reminds that she has almost killed a person, she is very frightened. Even if she acts wayward, she knows that killing people is against the law. She can’t do something against the law.
	Even though she has a strong family background, she can’t do such thing. Once it is done, even if the marks are erased, it will follow her like a shadow in the whole life of her.
	Dan William asks Cindy Swift to take the food to the bedroom, thus Jamie Moore eats food in the bedroom happily. 
Chapter 301: Now She Feels very Happy!
	Now she is full, and she feels very happy!
	Dan William puts down his bowl after eating a bowl of rice, but Jamie Moore is still eating happily. She puts much food in her mouth. Her eyes are full of satisfaction from eating. And she looks very cute now.
	Jamie Moore eats in a quick speed, and she almost eats all the food on the table. But she is still eating, and she even eats quicker than before.
	"Amelia has done such a bad thing to you. Do you hate her?” Dan William puts one leg on the edge of the bed. Then he says with his hand under his chin.
	Hearing Dan William’s words, Jamie Moore tries all her efforts to swallow the food in her mouth. She swallows for several times, and then she swallows all the food finally. She says as she puts the food in her bowl.“We can’t blame her. This is what I owe her.”
	"What did you mean?" Dan William frowns, and he notices there must be something behind. Sure enough, there is some problem in this thing. Maybe this is the reason why Amelia has a bad relationship with Jamie Moore.
	Five years ago, Jamie Moore leaves suddenly because there is some misunderstanding between them.
	So many things happened recently, thus Dan William doesn’t have time to think about this. If this thing is not explained clearly, Jamie Moore will always think it in her heart, and maybe she will get stuck to it.
	Their love may not be perfect, but there cannot be any misunderstanding between them.
	"When Amelia is nine years old, she has been lost once. Do you remember this?” Jamie Moore is a little sad when she reminds of this thing. And she even loses her appetite. But when she looks at the meat on her blow, she still puts several meats in her mouth, and eats them.
	"At that time, we play hide and find, but I didn’t find her. Thus she is locked in the warehouse all day and all night. We didn’t find her until she climbs out of the window." Jamie Moore says as she thinks the expression on Amelia’s face when Amelia says this to her.
	It's hatred, disappointment, and fear.
	At that time, Amelia is just nine years old, thus she must be scared with this. What’s more, Jamie Moore hears the sound of dripping when he is locked in the room of the Frank Family.
	Amelia once said that she will let Jamie Moore suffers what she has suffered, thus she locks Jamie Moore in the wooden house. Then the house is catching fire.
	Does Amelia mean to burn the house? It’s so strange. When they found Amelia, the warehouse was not on fire.
	"What did you find?" Dan William blinks, and then he asks.
	"Is there something bad with Amelia’s mentality?” Jamie Moore guesses as she bites her lips.
	Then she tells all the things happened in the Frank Family to Dan William.
	If the sound of dripping she heard in the Frank Family is made by Amelia, Amelia must know that this sound can make people nervous and out of their mind.
	But why does she know that? Unless she has a mentality disease for this, thus she makes this in the room. She wants Jamie Moore has a mental breakdown, resulting in psychological trauma.
	Dan William frowns. After thinking for a while, he shakes his head,“No. Amelia is fine all the time. She is seldom ill. It’s impossible that she has a mental disease.
	"Do you remember that Amelia went abroad for three years?" Jamie Moore puts down her chopsticks, and sits beside Dan William, and then she looks at Dan William.
	"Do you mean the reason that Amelia went abroad for three years is not for relaxation, but for psychotherapy?" Dan William smiles as he understands the meaning of Jamie Moore suddenly.
	Jamie Moore nods, and this is what she thinks. But if this is the truth, it remains to be found out.
	If Amelia went abroad for treating her psychotherapy, she really owes her too much.
	"Wait, I'll let Derek William to investigate this." Dan William walks to the balcony with his phone, and then he gives a call to Derek William.
	Dan William asks Derek William to investigate the thing of the Frank Family.
	"OK. Young master, I will send it to you in five minutes." After receiving the call from Dan William, Derek William stops his work immediately, and he begins to investigate the thing related to Amelia.
	Dan William returns back to the bedroom after hanging up. He throws the phone on the table at will, and then he goes to the study room and takes the laptop to the bedroom.
	“Derek William is really good at computer.” Jamie Moore looks at the information on the computer, and then she says.
	Her baby is also good at computer.
	"By the way, does Ian Moore know the injury of me? It’s so late now. Where could he be at this time?” Jamie Moore suddenly reminds that she hasn’t meet Ian for a night, and she even doesn’t see Kiki!
	Do they run away with some beautiful woman or handsome man?
	"Bunny goes out with Night.1, and he lets me to ask a leave from you." Dan William knocks on the keyboard quickly. He adjusts the words in a right font size, and puts it in the middle.
	"Ask for a leave? When did I permit this?" Jamie Moore murmurs gloomily. They act first and report after the action. This naughty boy must play outside with something. He goes out so frequently. Kiki also goes out with him. This dog is so loyal.
	Jamie Moore believes that Ian Moore will be cheated by others. Otherwise, she will pull him back immediately.
	What’s more, Kiki stays beside Ian Moore. Dan William told her the "identity" of Kiki. Well, Kiki is not ordinary dog at all. Bad man will not make trouble with Ian Moore. And Ian Moore will not be cheated by bad man, so she is relieved.
	She walks to look at to the screen of the computer. It’s a report.
	The more she sees, the more upset she is. Although Jamie Moore doesn’t know the terms on the report, she knows from the words that Amelia really suffers psychic trauma.
	She stayed abroad with Mrs. William for three year. And it was not for relaxation, but for treatment.
	Now Jamie Moore wishes that all of this is just a guess, and it’s not the truth.
	It takes Amelia three years to get rid of those terrible nightmares, and become an ordinary people. The difficulties can be imagined. Some people may not get rid of this within three years.
	Thinking that, Jamie Moore feels sort of relieved.
	"So I'm really sorry for her. You don't have to make trouble with her for me. She's forced to do this." Jamie Moore smiles bitterly.
	If she could be more carefully at that time, and find Amelia trapped in the bookcase, maybe this tragedy would’ve not happened.
	It’s understandable that Amelia hates her. She can’t blame her for this.
	Dan William rubs her hair, and then he pinches Jamie Moore’s beautiful face, “Do you want to have a rest in other place?
	"Where?" The eyes of Jamie Moore become bright. She looks at Dan William with her beautiful eyes, and she looks very attractive now.
	“Where do you want to go?”
	Jamie Moore tilts her head, and then she thinks carefully. She doesn't have much interest in playing abroad, but there are too many things happened recently. It's good to go out to have a rest. 
Chapter 302: 302: Where is She?
	"France." Jamie Moore says with cunning eyes. It seems that she is plotting something.
	Dan William thinks for a while, but he doesn’t answer her. Yet, he doesn’t refuse her. Instead, he says, “Let’s go to bed.”
	Jamie Moore knows that he would not let her down since he has asked her. Thus Jamie Moore lies on the bed, and covers herself with quilt. She grabs the corner of the quilt with two hands, and then she closes her eyes happily.
	Dan William smiles. She is so easy to satisfy. She will be happy when she eats delicious food or meets something good.
	But this is not enough for her to forget the thing in the past. There must have other compensation for her.
	Dan William knows the personality of Jamie Moore well. She doesn’t like showing the words in her heart out. Instead, she likes to hide them in her heart. If she doesn’t understand something, she will try all her efforts to figure it out.
	-
	In the next day, Jamie Moore is awakened by a terrible feeling. Subconsciously, she feels that she is very dangerous. It seems that she is hanging in the air.
	She can’t bear it finally, thus she opens her eyes. What she sees is something white.
	She blinks her eyes, and then she turns around. But she only sees a chair...
	Where is she now?
	"You are awake now." The voice of Dan William sounds behind her. Jamie Moore looks around, and then Dan William, who wears a wine red leisure sweater, looking at the computer beside her. Seeing that she is awake, he hands a bottle of water to her.
	Jamie Moore picks up the water, and then she looks around. Then she finds she is actually in the cabin of the plane. No wonder that she has a bad feeling——she is hanging in the air.
	"What are you going to do? Will you sell me to other people?” Jamie Moore holds Dan William’s arms, and she looks at him warily.
	She just wakes up, thus she is still in a dizzy mind, and she doesn’t follow the mind of Dan William.
	Dan William presses his lips, and then he puts the computer on his legs. He flips Jamie Moore’s head,“What are you thinking?”
	"Mommy is very cheap, thus Daddy will not sell Mommy." Ian Moore leans over from the back seat. He makes a face at Jamie Moore. He is very naughty.
	Jamie Moore wrinkles her nose, and then she stares at Ian. What did he mean? Naughty boy. Is he praising or despising her?
	"We will arrive at France in an hour. You can sleep now. I will call you when we arrive.” Dan William covers a blanket on her body, and then says.
	"Oh." Jamie Moore nods. She is still in puzzle. What’s more, she is a little dizzy. Then she closes her eyes after covering the quilt well.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore, and then he slows down his action of knocking the keyboard. Then the atmosphere around Jamie Moore is very quiet.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t wake up when they arrive at the airport in France. Thus Dan William can only get on the car with Jamie Moore is his arms.
	In the hotel room in Paris, Jamie Moore, who sleeps in the bed, turns over, and then the door is opened.
	Ian Moore opens the door. He looks at the room, and then he walks into the room.
	Ian Moore frowns when he sees Jamie Moore who sleeps in the bed. He runs over and shouts, “Mommy, the sun is hanging highly. I am hungry!”
	"What?" Jamie Moore is thrilled awake. Thus she jumps straight from the bed, and she is still in a dazzling. She looks very cute now.
	She lowers her head, and then she finds Ian Moore is looking at her ruefully. Ian Moore presses his lips, and it seems that he is very upset.
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes, and then she throws herself hard onto the bed.“What are you doing? You mommy is timid. How could you scare me?”
	Ian Moore doesn’t give up in such a way. He climbs on the bed. Then she looks at Jamie Moore with his big eyes pitifully. “Mommy, I am aggrieved.”
	Jamie Moore laughs. Then she pinches the face of Ian Moore, and says with a smile, “How are you wronged? If you want to eat something, you can let Cindy Swift to cook it for you? Mommy wants to sleep now.”
	"Mommy, this is France. Cindy Swift is not here!" Ian Moore changes his face suddenly. Then he grabs Jamie Moore’s hair in a coquettish way.
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely. Then she sits up suddenly. She runs toward the widow, and then she opens the dark red curtain.
	It’s night now. The whole Paris is shrouded in the night. Looking out to the distant, everywhere is the beautiful scenery. When you look up, you can see the towering Paris towers in the distance. The lights on the tower are bright.
	Jamie Moore is excited, but she is not excited about the Paris tower, and she is not excited about the romantic capital of France. What she excites is that now she stands on the place where her relatives are.
	Her brother and daddy are here. She misses them very much.
	"Mommy, I also miss grandpa and uncle very much." Ian Moore grabs Jamie Moore’s finger. He looks at the night outside the window with expectation.
	"Mommy will take you there tomorrow." Jamie Moore is very happy now. She breathes the fresh air out of the window. She feels that the warm appear in her heart now.
	"By the way, where's your father?" Jamie Moore closes the window and goes back.
	"Daddy is still working now. He will come to find me when he finishes his work.” Ian Moore walks to the suitcase of Jamie Moore, and then he pulls it to Jamie Moore.
	They come out to have a rest, but he still needs to work...Wait. Is work the main purpose?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips hardly. He is really a workaholic!
	...
	At about 10 o'clock in the morning, Dan William goes to the branch office in France after telling some precautions to Jamie Moore and Ian Moore. It is said that there are some problems with the latest products, so he needs to go there in person.
	As Jamie Moore guesses, Dan William comes to France for working, not for playing.
	Recently, CR has launched a complete set of clothes with collocating perfume. Until now, Jamie Moore doesn’t know that CR not only aims at clothing, but also aims at perfume and other products. In France, the perfume of CR is more popular than that of Star.
	The Star just occupies the market of Country C.
	Jamie Moore dresses in casual clothes. She wears a black T-shirt with a white pencil pants, a black leather jacket, and she also wears a flat hat on her head. She looks very fashion now.
	Ian Moore wears a small shirt, a pair of shorts, and a dark blue vest. There is even a red bow tie at the collar. What’s more, he wears a pair of big black rimmed glasses on his small face, but the glass doesn’t have lenses. He puts his hands in his pocket, and it’s cool and handsome. Now he looks like Conan very much.
	"Ah, baby. Are you playing Cosplay?" Jamie Moore looks back when she carries the bag on her back well. She is amused seeing Ian Moore who stands beside the door.
	Ian Moore stays with Jamie Moore since he is born. Thus he also knows a lot about the matching of clothes. Although his clothes are bought by Jamie Moore and Dan William, he matches them by himself. 
Chapter 303: Sharp!
	Although he is young, in fact, he always flatters himself.
	When he wears this set of clothes, he finds that he looks like Conan. Thus he wears a pair of big black rimmed glasses without lenses on his small face. He is very satisfied with himself today.
	Wow! Sharp!
	"Mommy, I know that I am handsome, but don’t fall in love with me.” Ian Moore says with his waggling.
	"Why!" Jamie Moore reminds that she doesn’t take her wallet, thus she goes to take her wallet and puts it on her bags as she says.
	The handsome face of Ian Moore changes suddenly, “Because daddy will kick my little ass!”
	He covers his face in a shy way.
	Ian Moore thinks that it's disgraceful to get spank from dad. But he thinks that it's not disgraceful to be beaten by Jamie Moore. Why? Because he's used to it...
	"Haha, you are so sweet. I'll give you a pancake later." After arranging everything well, Jamie Moore walks to Ian Moore, and then picks him in her arms. Then they walk out.
	Ian Moore covers his face quickly to hide himself well. It's so embarrassing to be carried up by parents since he is now a grown man.
	Jamie Moore and Ian Moore leave the hotel before having breakfast. Dan William leaves a car for them before he goes to the branch office, so they don’t worry about the traffic.
	What’s more, Jamie Moore and Ian Moore can speak French. So it’s not difficult for them to live in the France freely.
	Jamie Moore’s father Anthony Lockwood lives in a small town of France. His father also has a profound relationship with high-level officials in French. The Lockwood Family is the descendant of the French aristocracy. Because he wants to marry Adele Gilbert, he gives up the right of succession. Then he begins to go into business.
	Because Anthony Lockwood gives up the inheritance right of his family, he doesn’t get the power of the Lockwood Family. So when Adele Gilbert is trapped in the Moore Family, he doesn’t have ability to save her.
	But the force of the Lockwood Family infiltrates into Country C gradually, and they protect Adele Gilbert secretly. But the toxin has been planted on Adele Gilbert, thus they dare not to act recklessly.
	Annecy is one of the most beautiful towns in the world. It leans against the Alps and beautiful lake Annecy.
	Anthony Lockwood builds a manor here after the divorce of Adele Gilbert and Jack Moore. Now all affairs of the Lockwood Family are managed by Chris Lockwood.
	When Jamie Moore arrives at the manor of the Lockwood Family, her expectation almost brims over her heart.
	But she hasn’t returned her hometown for a long time, and she hasn’t met Anthony Lockwood and Chris Lockwood for so many years, thus Jamie Moore is a little nervous.
	There are only about ten servants in this manor. Jamie Moore and Ian Moore don’t tell them before they come back, so they don’t know this.
	"Mommy, quick. The grandpa and uncle are waiting for us. If we get there now, we may have breakfast with them." Ian Moore spits out his tongue mischievously. Then he looks around curiously.
	He is not so curious about the manor of Dan William. The environment here is quiet, and the walls are full of flowers, branches and leaves. Everywhere is green, and it’s full of vitality.
	Ian Moore loves here immediately.
	"Ah, naughty boy. You only know eat." Jamie Moore feels more relaxed after hearing the words of Ian Moore. She reaches out to knock on Ian Moore’s forehead.
	"Well, let's go quickly. I want to have lunch with them now..." She comes here without having breakfast. So she's not nervous. She's not nervous at all!
	But before they get into the room, a man jumps down the stairs quickly. Then that man runs toward them after falling.
	"Stop running! Catch him quickly! "Several bodyguards and servants run out of room. They are after that man.
	Seeing that man is going to bump into them, Jamie Moore pushes Ian Moore away quickly. But she is knocked down by the man.
	“Night. 1 and Night. 7!” Ian Moore stands up from the ground. He ignores the mud on his body, and then he asks coldly.
	Ian Moore comes out with Night.1 who has been punished by him. He has made a well preparation. Now it turns out that he is right.
	Night. 1 and Night. 7 act at the same time, and they act quickly. Thus they catch that man quickly.
	"Mommy." Seeing that the man is caught, Ian Moore runs to Jamie Moore and then helps Jamie Moore up.
	At this time, another hand picks Jamie Moore up quickly.
	Ian Moore is shocked. Then he looks up in surprise.
	"Are you OK?" He speaks in the language of Country C, instead of French. He says in a standard way as if he is a native of Country C.
	This is a handsome uncle. Although he is old, he is very mature. He looks very polite, and he is dignified and noble.
	He is Anthony Lockwood--Jamie Moore’s father.
	Jamie Moore’s eyes become red, and then she presses her lips. She tries all her efforts to press the bad feeling in her heart. Seeing that Anthony Lockwood looks at her with worries, she answers, “I am OK.”
	She stops and then says, “Dad.”
	"Jamie Moore, you are a grown woman now." Tears brim over in the eyes of Anthony Lockwood. He looks at Jamie Moore who looks like Adele Gilbert, and then he signs as reminded of something.
	Anthony Lockwood thinks that Jamie Moore looks like Adele Gilbert. They are alike in appearance and in temperament. Their eyes are all full of tenacity and elegance, and they are like one person.
	Jamie Moore cries when she hears the words of Anthony Lockwood. Jamie Moore doesn’t want to be a hypocritical woman. But she can’t withstand her tears once she begins.
	Ian Moore raises his little face to look at the handsome face of Anthony Lockwood. Then he calls sweetly,“Grandpa.”
	"Ian, our Ian is taller, too. Come, Grandpa wants to hug you.” Anthony Lockwood smiles happily. He hugs Ian Moore in his arms, and then he kisses Ian Moore’s cheek. He likes Ian Moore very much.
	"Dad, who is this man? How can he be here?"Jamie Moore looks at the man who is caught by Night.1 and Night.7, and then she asks in confusion.
	Anthony Lockwood glances at that man, and then he says to Jamie Moore with a smile, “Let’s get in the room first. Have you had breakfast? I will let the housekeeper cook something you love.”
	"Grandpa, Bunny is not picky about food." Ian Moore hugs Anthony Lockwood’s neck, and then he says. It’s true that he is not picky about any food. He seldom hates any food.
	Anthony Lockwood pinches the small face of lovely Ian Moore, and then he takes him to the sofa in the hall. "Our bunny is really decent."
	Night.1 and Night.7 brings that man to them. That man has been beaten heavily by Night.1 and Night.7 just now. Even though he is not tied up, he can’t run away now.
	"It must be your master who monitors me. Go back and tell him. If he disturbs my life again, don't blame me for making trouble with him." Anthony Lockwood says to that man, who lies on the ground, in French.
	Is there someone watching the Lockwood Family? Jamie Moore frowns, and then the figure of several people appears in her mind.
	As far as she knows, they are the only ones possible to do this.
	"What are you talking about? I don't understand. I just come here to steal something!" That man also responds to Anthony Lockwood in French. Although he is seriously injured, he still says in a strong way.
	
Chapter 304: Make Concession to Avoid Trouble
	Anthony Lockwood knows that this man will not admit it. He knows that though he gives up the right to inherit the Family, he could not satisfy their ambitions. They ask somebody to monitor him all the time.
	In the past, Anthony Lockwood would make concession to avoid trouble. If they like to monitor him, they can do this. But now Jamie Moore and Ian Moore come back, and that man almost hurt Jamie Moore. This is what Anthony Lockwood can’t bear with.
	Now Jamie Moore and Ian Moore is here, he doesn’t allowed that there is some dangerous around them.
	Today they ask someone to monitor him in the manor. What will they do tomorrow? Will they hurt people around him?
	"Blake." Anthony Lockwood glances at the housekeeper, who understands his meaning immediately. Then he takes that man out.
	Although Anthony Lockwood doesn’t say it clearly, it’s Blake who did this, and it means this man will lose his life soon or later.
	Since they want to make trouble with him, don’t blame that he will do something bad to them back.
	Jamie Moore bites her lips, and she is thinking something.
	When Blake takes that man away, Anthony Lockwood says to Jamie Moore and Ian Moore with a smile, “OK. Let’s have breakfast now.”
	"Well, thank you, Dad." Jamie Moore stands up, and then she and Ian Moore look at each other.
	It seems that they are saying——whee! We can eat free meal now~
	"By the way, Dad, why isn't brother here? Is he still in the company at this time? "Jamie Moore asks as she spreads ketchup on the toast.
	Anthony Lockwood havs asked the servants to set the table on the lawn. This place is bathed in the bright but not dazzling sunshine. The wind blows gently, and there is a lake across the lawn.
	Jamie Moore knows that Annecy is known as the purest lake in Europe. The water comes from the melting snow and rain on the Alps. If she has enough time, she would like to walk through this town, which can be called the paradise.
	Anthony Lockwood blinks, “Yes, he will come back at night. We don’t need to wait him now.”
	Ian Moore spreads the ketchup on the bread for himself, and then he spreads the ketchup for Anthony Lockwood. Then he hands it to Anthony Lockwood, and says, “Grandpa, this is for you."
	"Bunny is a good boy." Anthony Lockwod picks up the bread handed by Ian Moore, and his face are full of smile. Seeing this, even the servant looks at them.
	Anthony Lockwood has been worrying about the life of Jamie Moore and Ian Moore in the Country C, thus he hasn’t smiled like this for a long time.
	"Your mother has said that she wants to build a manor in the small town of Annecy in the future. After you and your brother were born, we would live here together.” Anthony Lockwood says suddenly. He looks at the front, and he is thinking of something.
	Jamie Moore is biting the toast. She stops eating when she hears something about Adele Gilbert.
	"Your mother likes this town very much. Since we separated, I have come here alone to make her dream come true." Anthony Lockwood says slowly. There isn’t any sadness in his voice. Instead, it’s happiness in his voice.
	"When you were born, I saw you for the first time. I am sorry I could only take your brother away and leave you there at that time."
	"I don’t blame you. You and mother were forced to do this. I live with my mother happily." Jamie Moore smiles, and what appears in her mind is the time she spent with Adele Gilbert.
	She loves lying her head on Adele Gilbert’s legs before she knew Dan William. She likes listening to the stories that she could not understand at that time, but that she is very interested in.
	Then Jamie Moore knows the story she loved are all about her mother and father.
	Then she meets Dan William. Mommy has told her something before leaving. Mommy told her that she should cherish the man in front of her. Otherwise, she may miss this man like her.
	At that time, Jamie Moore doesn’t know what she meant by missing.
	She likes eating chestnut cake most. She likes to lie on the arm of her mommy, and listening to the love story. It’s beautiful and simple.
	Although she doesn't know the love between other people, she clearly remembers that when mom mentions her father in the story, her smile was gentle and moving, which is sweeter than chestnut cake.
	Five years later, when she returns country C and fell in love with Dan William, she knew that Dan William and she had missed for five years.
	In the past, she never thinks that she and Dan William had missed for five years, but now, she thinks that she and Dan William should not lost those five years.
	She didn’t treat Dan William well with appreciation, but he always holds her as his treasure. He is such a good man. If she still doesn’t love him, what else does she want?
	"Mommy often tells me your stories. I know my mother loves you very much, so I never blame you." Jamie Moore smiles. Tears even appear in her eyes.
	In the past, she also cries in the room of Adele Gilbert secretly, but she never blamed her.
	Since she gave birth to Ian Moore, she can feel that her mother protects her with her small strength at that time. When Ian Moore is taken away by other people, she also has such feeling.
	Anthony Lockwood relieves. For so many years, he seldom has communication with his little daughter, and he is very sorry for this. He wants to give her all the best things to make up for her, but they ignore one thing. She had grown up and she has become a mother. She knows the difficulties of them.
	"If Adele is still alive, she will be happy seeing you.” Anthony Lockwood says.
	Jamie Moore smiles without saying a word, and then she rubs the little head of Ian Moore.
	"Master, there is a gentleman outside." Blake walks to them and then he says in a respect way. He wears a pair of white gloves on his hands. Like all the housekeepers in the TV series, he wears a black suit and gold rimmed glasses, giving other people a feeling that we can trust this man.
	What’s more, he says French well, and he has a handsome face, which adds more charm him.
	“Who?” Anthony Lockwood turns to look at Blake and then asks strangely.
	"I don't know. He just said that he is Miss's friend."
	Anthony Lockwood looks at Jamie Moore, but Jamie Moore looks at Blake with confusion. Friend? She doesn't know many people in France. Does Dan William come here to see her?
	Jamie Moore thinks this is true, thus she puts down the toast in her hand. She stands up, and says to Ian Moore, “Baby, you accompany grandpa here, and mommy goes out to have a look."
	"OK, Mommy." Ian Moore smiles at Jamie Moore. He smiles so innocent, and Night.1 and Night.7, who stays in the dark, is shocked by this.
	"Dad, I'll go out to have a look first." Jamie Moore walks out with Blake after saying to Anthony Lockwood.
	At the front door of the manor, Jamie Moore pushes the iron door with the rattan on it and walks out. Then she sees a man standing in front of her.
	This back is very familiar. Is he...
	"Ryan?" Jamie Moore calls tentatively, and then she walks forward.
	Hearing the voice, that man turns around, and his eyes are full of sunshine, which could warm other people. 
Chapter 305: Wish I have not Bothered You.
	Sure enough, it’s Ryan Jack.
	Jamie Moore is surprised. How could he be here? And he even knows she's here. Even Dan William doesn’t know that she is here.
	How could he know this?
	“Jamie Moore.” Ryan Jack asks gently. He in a casual white suit, and looks at her naturally. "I saw you come in with Bunny, so I come here to find you. Wish I have not Bothered You.”
	The confusion in Jamie Moore’s heart disappeared gradually. Then she says with a smile, “Of course not. But how can you be in France? Are you well now?"
	Jamie Moore worries about the injury of Ryan Jack, thus she asks. She hasn’t met Ryan Jack since the last time. She never expects that they would meet each other here today.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t find that Ryan Jack stares at her with the joy and tenderness in his eyes, “I am OK now. Our company has cooperation with SY, so I come here. Why are you here?”
	"I..." Jamie Moore hesitates for a while, and then she bites her lips, “I'm here for traveling, and I'm here to see a friend."
	"Well." Ryan Jack nods without any doubt, “OK, I will not bother you now. The staff of the SY company is waiting for me now."
	"Well, see you next time." Jamie Moore waves at him, and then she relieves.
	Fortunately, Ryan Jack doesn’t ask more. Otherwise, she doesn’t know how to hide this.
	No one can know the thing related to her father, and even Ryan Jack can’t know this.
	Her enemy is Jack Moore. Now she doesn’t know the hidden forces of Jack Moore. It’s not that she doesn’t believe Jack Moore, but she wants to protect her family. She can't take any risks.
	Ryan Jack gets on a car after leaving the manor.
	"Didn’t she doubt you?" A voice suddenly sounds in the car, and then asks leisurely.
	Ryan Jack looks at the scene out of the window with his hand under his chin. The eyesight of him is very soft, “Why does she doubt me?”
	That man doesn’t say anything later. And the car leaves away.
	Originally, Jamie Moore could live in the manor of the Lockwood Family. But if she does in such way, she should tell everything to Dan William.
	She had planned to tell this to Dan William, so she doesn’t have any pressure now.
	Jamie Moore takes Ian Moore back to the hotel before having dinner.
	When she just walks into the hotel, she sees Dan William who sits in the restaurant of the hotel.
	He sits in a corner, and he looks at the laptop in front of him lazily and casually. He taps the keyboard with his long fingers rhythmically. The atmosphere around him is very cold, and no one dares to approach him.
	He focuses his eyesight on the computer screen. He frowns from time to time. Looking from here, she can see his long curly eyelashes blinking up and down, casting a shadow at the eye socket.
	No matter in which angle, everyone will be attracted by this man.
	Jamie Moore smiles, and then she wants to walk to Dan William with Ian Moore. But then she finds a French woman in a one-piece white suspender dress walking towards the position of Dan William.
	Jamie Moore stops walking forward, and she stands still with Ian Moore.
	Other people even could see her chest from her collar. The long dress is even bareback. In Jamie Moore’s eyes, the whole dress is just too scant.
	"Mommy, isn't this aunt cold? She wears so little clothes, and the clothes even can’t hide her butt." Ian Moore wrinkles his lovely little nose. Seeing that woman walking to Dan William, and then sit beside Dan William, Ian Moore’s eyes are full of anger. She stares at that woman.
	Jamie Moore looks at Ian Moore, and then she says as she touches his head, “Baby, this aunt is poor, and she can’t afford the clothes that can cover her ass. But we can’t laugh at her so blatantly. Do you understand?"
	Ian Moore stops, and then says with his laugh-out-loud, “OK, mommy.”
	"My sweet boy." Jamie Moore casts a look at him with a tacit smile. Then they sit on the seat, and stares at Dan William and that French woman.
	The waiters who passed by all look at this funny mother and son curiously, but they both speak the language of the Country C, so no one could understand them.
	"Mommy, this old woman must love my daddy. Are you sure that you don’t take any action?” Ian Moore looks at Dan William with his hands curling into a pair of telescope, and then he reports to Jamie Moore.
	Ian Moore doesn’t call that woman aunt, instead, he calls her old woman. It can be seen that Ian Moore hates other woman who stays close to his daddy. She is seducing his daddy!
	"What did your father do?" Jamie Moore sits in the corner against Dan William and asks.
	Ian Moore answers immediately, “That old woman moved close to daddy, but daddy dodges away!”
	He did so well!
	Jamie Moore slaps her legs. And then she realizes she has slapped too hard. Then she touches the hurt place lightly.
	“You should continue watching them.”
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and then he continues to look at them speechlessly. It's not good to do this again. This woman is not easy to deal with. Now it's time for mommy and him to take action!
	"Mommy, it’s bad now!” Ian Moore shouts in a low voice, "That old woman almost pressed her lips to Daddy!"
	"What?" The mood of Jamie Moore becomes bad immediately. She stands up from the seat, and the she walks towards the position of Dan William angrily.
	Ian Moore giggles behind Jamie Moore, and then he follows behind Jamie Moore.
	Dan William is dealing with the delayed launch of clothes in the branch company, which is the top secret of the company. When he feels that someone is approaching him, he closes the computer.
	He picks up the coffee cup on the table, and the coffee is still hot. He just comes here, thus the coffee is hot.
	But he doesn’t expect that this woman sits down directly. He ignores her, but this woman keeps approaching him. He hates this strong smell of perfume, thus he frowns.
	He wants to leave, but he sees that Jamie Moore walks toward him angrily. Thus he stops his action.
	He wants to know how Jamie Moore will drive this woman away.
	Jamie Moore walks to the seat of Dan William. Then she hides all her anger suddenly. She wears an official smile on her delicate face. She reaches out to pat the shoulder of that French woman, and then she says in French, “I am sorry. This is my husband. You should leave now.”
	She also smells the stinking perfume on the body of that woman. Jamie is a little uncomfortable, thus she takes a few steps back.
Chapter 306: Your Turn will never Come!
	Dan William smiles as he hears the words of Jamie Moore. Although Dan William doesn’t speak anything, the joy in his eyes could directly express his thoughts.
	But that woman looks at Jamie Moore impatiently, “Really? Miss, if you also want this handsome man, please wait in line, OK?”
	What?
	Queue up?
	Old woman, this is her husband. Even though they have to queue up, your turn will never come!
	Jamie Moore stares at Dan William. Now he is in French, other women still stay around him,” Miss, don’t you know this man has a wife? He has wife. Are you sure that you want to make a scene of yourself here?"
	The face of that woman changes, and she wants to say something.
	At this time, Ian Moore comes out from behind Jamie Moore. He looks at Dan William and that woman in surprise, “Daddy, who is this aunt? Is she your girlfriend outside?”
	He swells his cheeks in an aggrieved way, and then he looks at Dan William discontentedly.
	Ian Moore says in French. Although his voice is immature, it is very standard. It can be seen that he speaks French from childhood.
	It’s Chris Lockwood and Jamie Moore who teaches Ian Moore French. At first, Jamie Moore doesn’t want to teach this to Ian Moore. When Chris Lockwood appears in their life, he begins to teach Ian Moore.
	Dan William is surprised when he finds Ian Moore could speak French so well. And he is also proud of this.
	Jamie Moore gives a thumb to Ian Moore. She gets so proud of him for their tacit perfect action.
	The expression on that woman’s face gets worse than before. She's embarrassed when she looks at the innocent eyes of Ian Moore. She doesn't know that this handsome man has married someone, and she even has a son.
	If she stays here, she makes a fool of herself here really.
	The woman stands up with her bag, and then she leaves.
	Jamie Moore and Ian Moore look at each other, and then she gives a five with Ian Moore, “Yeah!”
	Jamie Moore and Ian Moore look at each other with a smile.
	"Ahem." Seeing that they ignore him, Dan William clears his throat, and he tries to attract their attention.
	But Jamie Moore and Ian Moore still ignore him, and then they sit to Dan William. Then they order some food.
	“Mommy, I want to eat this. This is delicious.” Ian Moore points to the food on the menu and shows it to Jamie Moore, and they ignore Dan William.
	"Well, we want this. Thank you.” Jamie Moore closes the menu after ordering the food. And she doesn’t ask Dan William if he wants to eat it.
	Dan William presses his lips, and he is speechless. They two want to ignore him completely. They are so brave.
	"Mommy, daddy is here." Ian Moore notices Dan William, and then he turns to ask Jamie Moore.
	Dan William signs. His son is so considerate at the critical time.
	Jamie Moore snorts, and then she looks at Dan William. She is shocked.
	His eyes are very bright, and it seems that there is a vortex hidden in his eyes. People will be absorbed to it.
	The corner of his eyes is raised, and his eyesight is very bright. It’s full of charm. Other people can’t move their eyes as long as they look at Dan William.
	He is so charming, and he is so attractive...
	Jamie Moore swallows her saliva subconsciously, and she stares at Dan William without blinking.
	"Mommy, Mommy? We can eat now." Ian Moore calls Jamie Moore several times, but Jamie Moore doesn’t answer him. Thus he reaches out to twist on her thigh.
	“Ah!” Jamie Moore blurts out. She feels very pain, and she touches her thigh. It’s so painful. How could he twist her with strength?
	“Naughty boy, how could you twist your mother? Do you believe that I will throw you out?” Jamie Moore pinches the small face of Ian Moore. She wants to knead him together now.
	Ian Moore sobs when Jamie Moore pinches his small face, “Mommy, you were enchanted by daddy. Um.”
	Jamie Moore’s face turns red after hearing Ian Moore’s words. Now her face must be red now.
	Hum. How could Dan William play this with her? She was almost trapped in this!
	"Do you still want to say something? One more word I’ll kick you out our home” Jamie Moore stares at Ian Moore.
	Dan William smiles, and then he says softly, “Baby, come here.”
	When Ian Moore finds that Dan William will help him, he runs out of the arm of Jamie Moore, and runs to the arm of the Dan William.
	He is like a loach. Jamie Moore wants to catch him, but he acts so fast, thus Jamie Moore doesn’t catch him.
	Thus Jamie Moore can only stare at Ian Moore who lies on the arms of Dan William. She shows the unhappiness in her heart through her eyesight.
	"Daddy is here, and the witch dares not come here." Dan William stares at Jamie Moore, and then he says to Ian Moore.
	Bah! You are the witch! You are the old witch!
	Jamie Moore scolds in her heart, and then she begins to eat food on the table.
	Her face is still red, which is very attractive.
	In fact, she is not shy. No matter what she does, her face will never turn red. But all of this is useless in front of Dan William.
	“What do you want to eat? Daddy will bring it to you.” Dan William is in a good mood. He smiles as he rubs the forehead of Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore, who lies on his daddy’s arm, doesn’t find how terrible he is now. He points at the dish in the middle.
	But Night. 7 is shocked completely. Usually, only if Ian Moore is in a good mood, she dares to pinch his small face. However, Dan William could do this at any time easily. Sure enough, blood relationship is very important!
	Ian Moore looks very happy now, and everyone wants to pinch his small face.
	The scene is transferred at once. It’s Dan William who should be neglected. But now they ignore Jamie Moore together. Dan William only uses the tact of beauty to her only, but she even loses her mind for this.
	Jamie Moore, you are really an anthomaniac.
	"Where did you go today? And you return back so late.” Dan William asks as he cuts the steak on the plate into small pieces so that Ian Moore could eat it.
	Ian Moore begins to eats the steak. Hearing Dan William’s words, he moves his eyesight immediately. He murmurs in his heart, “I don't know anything"...
	In fact, Dan William knows where Jamie Moore goes. Jamie Moore thinks that he doesn’t know this, but Ian Moore has told him most of it. He just wants to know whether Jamie Moore believes him or not.
	Ian Moore can’t tell everything to him. Why can’t she?
	Jamie Moore stabs the beef in the plate with the knife, and then she puts down her knife and fork. She looks around, and she finds they sit in the corner. There are not many people here, so she can tell the truth to Dan William.
	"The thing I am going to say is very important. I hope that you won't tell anyone." Jamie Moore says seriously, and she also looks at Dan William seriously. 
Chapter 307: She Trust Him 100%.
	Dan William is very happy in his heart, and his heart also calms down for the words of Jamie Moore.
	She still trusts him.
	After hearing these words, Dan William feels very happy for any words Jamie Moore might say.
	Jamie Moore tells everything simply, and she doesn’t hide anything to Dan William. She tells all to Dan William.
	In fact, if she doesn’t tell this to Dan William, Dan William will not ask. But Jamie Moore thinks that she loves this man. Since she chooses him, she should believe him. It is not necessary to hide this to him.
	She trusts Dan William very much.
	"As far as I know, there is a banquet of the Lockwood Family. It's the 70th birthday of the old master of the Lockwood Family. The old master of the Lockwood Family will choose one successor to inherit the whole Lockwood Family." Dan William reminds what he has investigated recently, and the Lockwood Family is also included.
	"What a coincidence?" Jamie Moore looks at him in surprise. They just come here, and they meet the birthday of her grandfather. It’s such a coincidence.
	Her father doesn’t tell this to her. Maybe her father will not go the banquet of her grandfather.
	"In fact, if your father doesn't give up the inheritance right, he is the one who is most likely to inherit the Lockwood Family." Dan William puts down the knife and fork after cutting the steak. Then he analyses.
	Ian Moore hears the words of them as he eats. He blinks his big eyes as if he doesn’t know everything. In fact, he knows everything well.
	Before they arrive in France, he has asked Night.1 and Night.7 to investigate the Lockwood Family. Then he finds that though his grandpa has given up the fight for inheritance, the brothers of his grandfather still see him as a thorn in their backs.
	The man who runs out of the manor at that day is the best proof.
	When the banquet for the old master of the Lockwood is coming, those people also get some bad ideas. Thus they make trouble with Anthony Lockwood. They want to kill Anthony Lockwood before the banquet. In this way, they will cut out a strong competitor.
	Does her father owe the biggest right to be the successor?
	Jamie Moore is shocked, and her heart Jumps heavily. If this is true, will her father become the first enemy of those people?
	"Why does my father owe the big chance to be the successor?" Jamie Moore asks in a hurry.
	Dan William takes a sip of coffee, and then he continues to say, “Because he is your grandfather's favorite little son, and your grandfather devotes a lot of effort to your father. Even if your father gives up the inheritance right, he is still the best successor in your grandfather's mind."
	Hearing this, Jamie Moore understands suddenly. Chris Lockwood has told her that the mother of his father is the first wife of the old master of Lockwood Family. The old master of Lockwood Family loves her most. But she doesn’t give any birth to child after marrying.
	The Lockwood Family has a strong family background. The old master of Lockwood Family is the helmsman. Every action of him is under other people's eyes.
	The former leader of the Lockwood Family forces him to marry another woman. That woman gives birth to two sons and a daughter. Later, his first wife was also pregnant. But she died of a heart attack soon after giving birth to Anthony Lockwood.
	This thing is the thorn in the heart of the old master of Lockwood Family, so he gives the share of Anthony Lockwood’s mother to Anthony Lockwood together. He treats Anthony Lockwood better than the other two sons.
	Jamie Moore knows it’s for her mother that her father withdrew the competition. What’s more, her father even gives up the inheritance right, and goes to the Gilbert Family with her mother.
	At that time, Anthony Lockwood just begins to start business, and he often goes out. Anthony Lockwood was in France at the time when the Gilbert Family was destroyed. When he returned, everything had changed.
	At that time, the leader of the Gilbert Family hands Adele Gilbert to her father. Because they believe he can protect Adele Gilbert. He expands his power quickly at the years Adele Gilbert disappeared. Finally he plays an important role in France. Even though he doesn’t have the protection from the Lockwood Family, no one dared to disrespect him.
	This process is too complex. Jamie Moore only knows Jack Moore has an absolute trump card, which is one of the original ten member organizations of the Gilbert Family. So even if the staff of her father enters Country C, they can't be close to them. They can only protect them in the dark.
	Jamie Moore hasn’t met Jack Moore for a long time. Since the house of the Moore Family has been destroyed, she never saw Jack Moore. In fact, Jamie Moore knows from his words that day Jack Moore still has strong ambition.
	If she doesn’t find out that man, she is unable to settle down.
	"But my father doesn’t want to inherit that family." Jamie Moore bites her lips unhappily. There are so many tricks in that family. Her father has given up the inheritance right, those people still want to kill him.
	If her father returns back to that family, her father must be in danger.
	"This not something he can avoid if he doesn't want to. Even if he doesn't fight with them, those who want to get the inheritance right will fight against your father." Dan William says calmly. The atmosphere around him is very cold.
	Jamie Moore stops talking, and she holds her chin with her hand. She is thinking something.
	-
	Two days later.
	The quiet house suddenly becomes busy. Every car passes by the door should hand in an invitation letter. People who are checked by the guard of the Lockwood Family could also enter the house.
	People who come here are all famous. The family who has a good relationship with the Lockwood Family also could receive the invitation.
	A black Cadillac finally drives into the Lockwood Family. The car stops at the front door, and then the window of the car open slowly. A hand reaches out with a gold stamping invitation.
	The waiter glances at the invitation, and then he asks someone to search the car. Then the windows of the car are all open. A handsome and mature face appears in front of the waiter, “It’s me.”
	"Third young master, please." The waiter waves his hand to let those people return back immediately. Then he makes a sign of “Please” to Anthony Lockwood, and then he takes a few steps back.
	Anthony Lockwood nods, and then he closes the windows of the car
	The car drives into the Lockwood Family, and then drives through the path of the Wutong trees. Finally, the car stops in front of the villa.
	Two rows of waiters stand in front of the villa. They open the door on both sides for them, and they even block the roof with their hands so that they won’t be hit by the top of the car.
	Anthony Lockwood gets off the car when Jamie Moore is still in surprise. Anthony Lockwood walks to her side, and then reaches out his hand in a graceful way.
	"Dad, is it OK for you?" Jamie Moore puts her hand on her father’s hand, and then she gets off the car. She is a little worried. She knows that Anthony Lockwood doesn’t want to come. But she and Ian Moore want to go here, and her father worries about this, thus he comes with them.
	"It doesn't matter. Sooner or later, I need to come back." Anthony Lockwood says. And then he reaches out to Ian Moore, “Bunny, get off the car now.”
	Ian Moore covers his belly as he looks at Anthony Lockwood pitifully. Then he blinks his big eyes, and says, “Grandpa, I want to go to the bathroom." 
Chapter 308: Grandpa Will Lead You There.
	"Come, Grandpa will lead you there." Anthony Lockwood looks at Ian Moore lovely. He pulls Ian Moore out, and then he closes the door.
	Ian Moore shakes his head, and his face turn red, “Bunny can go alone. Grandpa, you just need to tell me where the bathroom is.”
	"Um..." Anthony Lockwood worries about Ian Moore. After all, the Lockwood Family is so big. Ian Moore is just a child, and he doesn’t know the way. If he loses his way, it would be hard to find him.
	"Dad, it's OK. Bunny is very smart. You just need to tell him the place and he can go back by himself." Jamie Moore, who knows Ian Moore well, doesn't worry about him at all.
	After all, Ian Moore is very smart. Even though Jamie Moore loses her way, Ian Moore will not get lost.
	Although Ian Moore is still young, he looks high of his face. It's Jamie Moore who forces him to take a shower. This stinky boy is very persistent on this.
	Anthony Lockwood looks at Jamie Moore as if he is confirming something. Then he nods, and points the position to Ian Moore. What’s more, he even tells Ian Moore where he could find them. And then he leaves with Jamie Moore.
	Seeing that Jamie Moore leaves with Anthony Lockwood, Ian Moore runs toward the bathroom.
	The bathroom of the Lockwood Family is also very large. Ian Moore searches in the manor for several times before he finds one. Fortunately, Anthony Lockwood tells the direction to him clearly, thus he doesn’t get lost.
	After finishing, Ian Moore walks to the washing table to wash his hands. But the washing table here is too high, he can’t reach it.
	There is not a stool here. Handsome Ian is not happy.
	"Well..." Ian Moore tries all his effort to reach the position of the washing table. He tries for several minutes, but he could only reach the switch of the faucet.
	If he knows this before...He should let Grandpa accompany him even though he is shy.
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and then he wants to step on the washing table.
	At this time, Ian Moore is hugged by a hand. He is held up, thus he could reach the tap switch.
	Ian Moore is shocked, and then he looks at the mirror of the washing table. Then he finds a kind and dignified face through mirror.
	This man is over sixty years old. His hair turns white. And his face is full of wrinkle. But it still could be seen that this man is handsome in his youth. The eyesight of him is full of momentum, as if he is born to be king.
	"Why do you stop?" The old man looks at him lovely, and he puts Ian Moore forward.
	Ian Moore withdraws his eyesight back, and then he puts his hands under the water. Then he washes his hand under the water. After washing for a while, Ian Moore wipes his hands with tissue. Then he throws the tissue into the garbage can.
	The old man puts Ian Moore down after Ian Moore finishes his action.
	He looks up, and then he smiles at the old man, “Thank you, grandpa.”
	"Boy, you are welcome. Who are your mother and father? Why haven't I seen you before?" The old man is leaning on a black sandalwood carved crutch. He smiles kindly and lovely. He squats down to look at Ian Moore.
	The mischievous light flashes in Ian Moore’s big eyes. And then he answers, “I am the child of my mommy. Maybe I am too ordinary, thus grandpa doesn't remember me."
	The old man gets this answer unexpectedly, and then he laughs. It seems that he is in a good mood. He rubs the head of Ian Moore kindly, “You are so smart. If I have seen you, I will remember you. I need to go to the front hall now? Aren’t you parents here?”
	Sure enough, Ian Moore is very handsome. Even though he is thrown into the crowd of children, he is very outstanding. Especially, he looks very smart. He is not a child of ordinary people at the first sight.
	This old man loves Ian Moore very much. When he reminds the child at home, he signs.
	As the saying goes, good children always come from other families.
	"My mommy goes to the front hall. I come here by myself." Ian Moore answers frankly. This grandfather doesn't look like a bad guy, and he feels that he is very familiar with his grandpa.
	Ian Moore will never treat strangers like this. He just feels that he is familiar with this old man, thus he does this.
	"Oh? Don't you worry about getting lost? It's big here. There are dozens of rooms." The old man raises his eyebrows, and then he looks at the face of Ian Moore. This child is so smart.
	"If grandpa doesn't believe this, I can take you there." Ian Moore wears a soft smile on his face. He looks very confident. His face looks very small under the big glass on his face. He also looks smarter than before.
	The old man moves, and then he feels that he has a special unspoken affinity with this child. Then he nods, “OK, you take grandpa to there."
	Ian Moore nods as the old man did. Then he walks out of the bathroom.
	The old man laughs when he sees the action of the Ian Moore. The old man throws the crutch to the bodyguard, and then follows behind Ian Moo.
	Ian Moore follows the route that Anthony Lockwood gives him. But this villa is really big, and he would get lost if he is not careful.
	Fortunately, he is not misled by the similar rooms at all. After walking for several minutes, he finally hears the noisy voice from the front hall.
	"Here we are." Ian Moore stands at the door, and then he turns to look at the old man. He looks very confident now.
	The surprise flashes in the sharp eyes of the old man. He looks at Ian Moore with love. The layout here is very complex, and the doors of the rooms are very similar, so it is inevitable for him to be misled.
	But this child walks toward the right direction without any hesitation. He really didn’t see this child in the past, otherwise, he thinks that this child is growing up here since he is a child.
	"Then I'll take you into the hall at this time. Let's go." The old man takes Ian Moore’s hand, and then walks toward that door. The waiter standing by the door immediately opens the door for them.
	...
	When Jamie Moore and Anthony Lockwood enter the hall, all people presented here look at them with doubt. Most of them look at Anthony Lockwood. Jamie Moore feels very strange when she finds the eyesight of two men always focusing on Anthony Lockwood.
	"One dressed in blue, whose name is Elan Lockwood. The man stood beside him is Adonis Lockwood. They are the first son and the second son of the Lockwood Family. The woman who stands beside them is their mother--Carola. Anthony Lockwood glances at the position of the Elan Lockwood and Adonis Lockwood. Then he introduces them to Jamie Moore briefly.
	Jamie Moore nods as she listens to him. She stares at them for a while, and then she moves her eyesight away.
	Dan William also will come here today. But they come here one by one. She doesn’t know if he is here now.
	Jamie Moore looks around in the hall, but she doesn’t find the figure of Dan William.
	Suddenly, a restless sound sounds in front of them. The crowd retreats from both sides, and two people walks into the middle. 
Chapter 309: Self-accusation.
	Jamie Moore looks at it curiously, and then she sees the hand of his son is taken by an old man. She presses her lips. Her son is so popular among the old and the young. But the face of this old man seems familiar...
	Even though Jamie Moore is surprised, she also finds the wrong atmosphere here. It seems that the people on the both side are afraid of this man. It can be seem that the identity of this man is not simple.
	It’s possible.
	Jamie Moore looks at the old man with her eyes opened. No wonder she feels so familiar with him. He looks like her father. So is this man her grandfather?
	The old man has walked to Jamie Moore and Anthony Lockwood with Ian Moore. The old man looks at Anthony Lockwood with joy. There is love and guilt on his face. In a word, the expression on his face is very complex.
	It’s the same as the thinking of her. Jamie Moore just looks at him quietly.
	"Dad." Anthony Lockwood asks. He still looks very warm. Although he is in his middle age, girls who love uncles will still be attracted by him.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family feels a little comfortable. Then he pats on the shoulder of Anthony Lockwood, “It’s better that you come back. I mean it”
	Anthony Lockwood is moved after hearing the words of the old master of the Lockwood Family. He doesn’t come back for so many years. He hurts the heart of his father, thus he is a little guilty.
	Although his brothers all see him as the enemy, his father really loves him.
	How could he be so ungrateful?
	"This is?" The old master of the Lockwood Family looks at Jamie Moore. It seems that he has seen this girl once.
	Jamie Moore looks up when she hears the words of the old master of the Lockwood Family. She smiles at him sweetly, “Hello, grandpa, my name is Jamie Moore, and I am your granddaughter.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family is moved by this. He looks at Jamie Moore who looks like Adele Gilbert. He finally reminds why Jamie Moore is so familiar. She looks like the wife of Anthony Lockwood.
	Although the old master has never met Jamie Moore, he has met Adele Gilbert before. He says to Anthony Lockwood when he hears the name of Jamie Moore, “I remember you told me that the name of your brother is Chris Lockwood, and the name of the little sister is Color Lockwood. Have they changed the name?”
	Color?
	Color Lockwood?
	Jamie Moore is surprised, she never expects that her daddy gives her such a name. The name of the brother is Chris Lockwood, and the name of the little sister should be Color Lockwood
	"Because my mommy helps me happy in all my life, so I named Jamie Moore." Seeing that Anthony Lockwood is also puzzled, Jamie Moore explains.
	Her mother has told this to her when she is still young. Her mother hopes her live happily, thus she named Jamie Moore
	But her father thinks her name is Color Lockwood. So when they meet for the first time, he calls her Color.
	It’s not because of the surname of the Moore Family. It’s because her name is Jamie Moore. If her surname is Lockwood, her name should be Jamie Moore Lockwood.
	Missing appears in Anthony Lockwood’s eyes, and then he murmurs, “Hoping Jamie Moore lives happily.”
	"It's a good name indeed, and grandfather also hopes you can live your life happily.” The old master of the Lockwood Family smiles lovingly. It seems that he has seen Jamie Moore as her granddaughter.
	"Thank you Grandpa." Jamie Moore smiles cleverly. The smile on her face is clean and bright. She looks very beautiful under the light shedding on her.
	Most men presented focus their eyes on Jamie Moore.
	Although she just stands there with a smile, but the temperament on her body attract other people.
	Especially when they hear that the old master of the Lockwood Family has seen Jamie Moore as his granddaughter, their eyes become brighter.
	"Mommy, your baby will protect Mommy, thus Mommy will live happily!” Ian Moore hears the words of them. But he never thinks that this kind old man is his great grandfather!
	Jamie Moore laughs when she hears the words of Ian Moore. When this naughty boy grows up, many people will love him. Now he is so young, he knows how to make her happy. What will he do in the future.
	The old master is surprised when he hears these words. He looks at Ian Moore in surprise. This child belongs to his family.
	This child is the son of his granddaughter!
	Is there anything happier than this?
	"Nice to meet you, great grandpa, my name is Ian Moore. I'm the son of my mommy, and I am your great grandson.” Ian Moore bows politely, and he looks like a gentleman now. People presented here are all attracted by this.
	"Well, well, well. Ian is a really good boy. Today I don’t prepare gifts for you. Now I will send this to you as a gift." The old master of the Lockwood Family smiles happily. And then he takes a ring off his hand and gives it to Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore looks at the ring in the old master of the Lockwood Family’s hand, but he doesn’t take the ring. The texture of this ring is very similar to his secret ring. It’s majestic and domineering. But it has different meanings. It must be extraordinary. He can't accept it.
	When Anthony Lockwood sees that ring, he looks at the old master of the Lockwood Family in surprise. This ring represents half of the power of the Lockwood Family. Father, you are...
	At the same time, when Elan Lockwood and Adonis Lockwood see the thing in the old master of the Lockwood Family’s hand. They look at each other, and they look at the thing in the old master of the Lockwood Family’s hand greedily.
	"Grandpa, this is too expensive. Ian Moore can’t accept this.” Jamie Moore looks at the ring, and then she refuses for Ian.
	This is not a common thing at even the first sight. It's too expensive for Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore also shakes his head after hearing the word of Jamie Moore. Then he says to the old master of the Lockwood Family, “It’s true. Great grandpa, I am very happy to see great grandpa today. It’s mommy and me who need to prepare a gift for such a meeting. How could the great grandpa prepare this?
	Hearing the words of Ian Moore, Jamie Moore and Anthony Lockwood relieves. If he gives this thing to Ian Moore, Ian Moore may lose this finally.
	What’s more, the action of the old master of the Lockwood Family has shown how much he loves Ian Moore. Now no one presented here dares to disrespect Ian Moore.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family thinks for a while, and then he doesn’t say anything. But he also doesn’t put the ring back on his hand. Instead, he puts the ring into his pocket. The he says to Ian Moore lovely, “Well, if you love something here, great grandpa will give it to you.”
	Ian Moore knows that the old master of the Lockwood Family will get angry if he refuses again, thus he nods.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family smiles with joy. Then he takes Ian Moore to the stage. Jamie Moore and Anthony Lockwood follow behind them.
	At first, the old master of the Lockwood Family thanks the people who come to the banquet. Then he introduces Ian Moore and Jamie Moore to the people. He admits the identity of them, and he even lets Anthony Lockwood return to the Lockwood Family.
	Anthony Lockwood doesn’t refuse at this time. Because he knows though he refuses, it’s useless. The old master of the Lockwood Family is determined to let him inherit the Family.
	The party begins. Ian Moore and Jamie Moore accompany the old master of the Lockwood Family to talk with other celebrities. This is also an introduction to introduce them into this circle, thus those people could remember them. 
Chapter 310: Everything Has Found Their Place
	In this way, the identity of Ian Moore and Jamie Moore has found its place.
	But in the William Family, it’s hard for Ian Moore and Jamie Moore to settle...
	Jamie Moore is a little tired now. Thus she finds an excuse to sit in the rest place, and she even finds something to eat there.
	Ian Moore stands beside the old master of the Lockwood Family. He is perfect whether in talking or behaving. It seems that he is born a gentleman, which surprises other people.
	But in fact, Ian Moore almost crushed within himself. He also wants to eat delicious food, and he also wants to sit down.
	Jamie Moore ignores the eyesight of Ian Moore, and she eats happily.
	"Are you Jamie Moore?" A shadow blocks in front of Jamie Moore, and she blocks the light to her.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and then she puts down the plate of cake. Then she looks at the shadow in front of her.
	It’s a woman who wears a heavy make-up. She dresses in a grand way. There are many jewelries hanging on her body, which could dazzle other people’s eyes.
	"I'm Jamie Moore. Excuse me, you are?" Jamie Moore asks.
	She knows this woman is Carola. She is the second wife of her grandfather.
	Carola looks up and down at Jamie Moore, and then she says with a smile, "As expected, you are a beautiful woman like your mother."
	She looks at Jamie Moore in a sophisticated way, which makes Jamie Moore uncomfortable.
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. She looks at the inquisitive and contemptuous eyesight of Carola, but she is not surprised.
	If she still could treat her so well after seeing the attitude of the old master toward Ian Moore and her. That would be a horror.
	"Even if the old master has admitted your identity, it doesn't mean that you are a member of the Lockwood Family. Don't pretend to be familiar with me when you see me in the future. I won't admit you as a granddaughter." Carola holds her arms around her chest, and it seems that she is superior to others.
	Granddaughter?
	Jamie Moore wants to laugh, but she covers her mouth to hide this and stands up. She is shorter than Carola. But today, she wears a pair of high-heeled shoes of 12cm, thus she doesn’t need to look up at Carola.
	"The second madams, my grandmother has passed away many years ago. Who are you? Are you the second wife of my grandpa or?” Jamie Moore doesn’t say the whole words out. But the smile in her eyes show all the meaning of her words clearly.
	The expression of Carola changes. But she is well trained since she is young, thus she presses the anger in her heart, and she doesn’t give a slap to Jamie Moore.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family is very satisfied with Jamie Moore. If she makes trouble with her now, everything will be her fault.
	"Girl, you are really good at talking. Have your parent taught you to talk with elders like this?" Seeing that she can’t get anything good from Jamie Moore, she is very angry. But she still wears a smile on her face, and she looks at Jamie Moore in a dignified and friendly manner.
	In the eyes of the outsider, she looks like an elder woman who loves their children.
	Jamie thinks that this woman is so shameless. She has said such words to her. How could she still stay and laugh at her here?
	Can she disappear now? She still wants to eat food, and she has no time to talk with her now.
	"How my parents teach me? That’s none of your business. You should manage yourself well." Jamie Moore says coldly, and her eyesight is also very cold. It looks like an ice flower, and it will break after touching.
	"She is just the daughter of a woman who doesn’t have any identity. She really treats herself as a young lady." Seeing this, Arlen, who is the maid of Carola, complains this to Carola. She looks at Jamie Moore, and then says.
	Carola smiles triumphantly, and she covers her face with the lady’s fan. It’s so delightful.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and she smiles. But her eyesight toward that two becomes cold. It seems that she wants to beat them heavily. It’s very similar to the expression of Dan William when he is angry.
	She has stayed with Dan William for a long time, and she could remember the every expression of Dan William in her heart. And she even shows the same temperament inadvertently.
	Carola and Arlen take a step back. They look at the eyes of Jamie Moore, and they are afraid of this. How could the eyesight of this girl be so horrible?
	"What did you say just now? If you have the ability, please say it again." Jamie Moore walks toward them slowly. She wears a big smile on her face. But it’s because of this shining quality of her smile that other people are afraid of her.
	Usually, when she smiles like this, someone will suffer.
	This rest place is the corner. Although it’s not very secret, it’s easy for Jamie Moore to do something bad to them quietly.
	The most intolerable thing for Jamie Moore is that someone offends the people she beloved.
	No one can do this!
	At this time, the music of the dance floor sounds, and the lights in the hall gradually dimmed.
	As a matter of fact, the opening dance should be started by the old master. But he is too old to do these things, so Anthony Lockwood does this thing for him.
	When the light of the hall dims, the small Jamie Moore slips forward. Then she comes to the front of the Carola and Arlen immediately.
	She grabs the hair of the Arlen with one hand, and she covers the mouth of Arlen with another hand. She treats Carola even badly. She kicks her away with her feet.
	Carola screams, but the sound is drowned in the music. And then Carola falls on the ground.
	"Do you want to be beaten? You deserve a lot of it. You do!” Jamie Moore covers Arlen’s mouth, and then she kicks the knee of Arlen hardly. Then she holds Arlen’s neck with another hand. Arlen wants to shout, but her mouth is covered by Jamie Moore tightly, thus Arlen can’t shout.
	"It seems that you are born by your father. Isn't your mother a woman? Isn’t your grandmother a woman? Is it a shemale who gave birth to you!" Jamie Moore says with eye-poping ugly words.
	Do they want to hurt her? She doesn’t have a good temper. If someone wants to make trouble with her, she will do it back to them. What’s more, they don’t have any way to fight back.
	These women says something bad to her. What’s more, they insult her mother. How could she bear with this.
	They deserve the beating!
	"Dead woman, can you say anything good? God!” Jamie Moore loosens the body of Arlen as she finishes her words. Thus Arlen falls on the ground.
	After doing all this, Jamie Moore looks for the figure of Anthony Lockwood in the crowd. There is a light on the body of Anthony Lockwood, thus it’s easy for Jamie Moore to find him
	Jamie Moore tidies up her dress and the hairdo which took her more than an hour. She wears a warm smile on her face when she looks up. And then she walks toward Anthony Lockwood.
	"Where is Jamie Moore? Find her out now!" Every time when Carola wants to stand up, she will be pushed by the dancing people. Finally, she stands up in embarrassment. 
Chapter 311: Have You Done Something Bad Here.
	Arlen has no strength to help Carola revenge. Jamie Moore hits her so badly, and she almost faints.
	She will never make trouble with this fierce man in the future!
	At this time, Jamie Moore has driven the dancing partner of Anthony Lockwood. Now she is dancing with her daddy.
	“Have you done any bad here? Anthony Lockwood knows Jamie Moore well. When he sees the proud smile on Jamie Moore’s face, and when he sees the Pearl headdress on her hair is crooked, and there are some wrinkles on Jamie Moore’s dress, he knows that she must have done something bad here.
	Jamie Moore doesn’t want to cheat him, thus she nods, “I beat Carola and I pushed the maid of Carola down.”
	In fact, she thinks this punishment is too light. She is too kind. Alas.
	Anthony Lockwood is shocked, and then he smiles. He doesn’t blame Jamie Moore, and he even doesn’t ask her the reason.
	Her daddy loves her so much. He is not like ordinary people. When other parents hear this thing, they may scold their child immediately. But her daddy is so calm.
	The light becomes bright gradually. When the dance is over, Jamie Moore goes to find Ian Moore. But when she walks a few steps, Carola rushes toward her. Jamie Moore dodges away quickly.
	"Second madam, the gift of meeting you are now showing me is so different. What do you want to do?" Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she stands straightly, and then she looks at Carola in a gloating way.
	Carola's face is a little twisted. Anyway, it’s very funny. Maybe this is because she kicks her just now.
	Carola rubs her distorted face with her fingers. She looks at Jamie Moore with hatred and disgust. She shows her disgust on her face directly.
	As a noble woman, the most important thing is this face. She spends much time to maintain her face every day. She has to take milk and petal bath at least twice a day.
	She is so strict with the maintenance every day. The petals she used are transferred from Bulgaria. She spends a lot of money on this thing.
	Even though she can’t get the love from the old master of the Lockwood Family, she should maintain her face well. Only in this way, other people would think the old master of the Lockwood Family loves her.
	But now, the face that she spends much energy to maintain, is twisted! It’s twisted! How could she bear with this?
	Carola is so angry now. She doesn’t know that she has fallen into the trap set by Jamie Moore. She is so stupid that she is still thinking about revenging Jamie Moore.
	"Bitch, you dare to push me. I'll fight with you!" Carola rushes toward Jamie Moore after stabilizing herself. It seems that she wants to die with her.
	Other noble women all take a few steps back after seeing the action of Carola. They never expect that the kind and virtuous madam of the Lockwood Family would do such a bad thing.
	Anthony Lockwood stands not far away from Jamie Moore. It’s too late when he finds this. Carola grabs Jamie Moore’s arms tightly, and then she raises her hand to slap at Jamie Moore’s face.
	“Ah!”
	A terrible sound sounds in the hall. People hearing this voice all trembled with fright.
	But it’s not Jamie Moore but Carola who shouts so loudly.
	When Carola is about to slap the face of Jamie Moore, a hand grabs her arm suddenly. That hand grabs Carola’s arm hardly, thus Carola’s arm is broken.
	Carola feels very painful, thus she shouts. She regrets when she shouts. There are so many people here. She loses all her face now.
	Jamie Moore looks at the man who grabs the hand of Carola. Originally, she thinks she will be beaten by Carola at this time. She could take this as being bitten by a pig. And then she finds Dan William appears.
	"How could you come here so late?" The cold eyes of Jamie Moore become soft, and the atmosphere around her is very warm. She smiles as she looks at the handsome Dan William. This man is in her eyes and her heart.
	Dan William withdraws his hand, and then he takes out a white paper to wipe his hand. Then he throws the paper to Derek William, and then he rubs the head of Jamie Moore, "I am delayed by something. Have you been hurt?”
	Jamie Moore smiles happily. Dan William hates Carola so much. Seeing this, Jamie Moore is very happy. Then she shakes her head, “I’m OK. Fortunately, you come in time."
	Otherwise, she would be beaten by Carola today. Carola is ready to slap with all her strength. If she is beaten by her, there would be wound on her face or her face would swell for a few days.
	Have this woman learnt Taekwondo before? She slaps so heavily. She could feel the hatred of Carola before she beats her.
	Hearing this loud sound, the old master of the Lockwood Family and Ian Moore walks toward the direction of the sound after saying sorry to the people they talked with.
	"Who are you? How could you dare to beat me?” Now Carola gets her sense. She bears the pain on her arms, and then she asks calmly.
	But the people presented here is not blind. They have seen the true personality of the Carola. But they are afraid of the Lockwood Family, thus they don’t say anything.
	Dan William stares at her coldly with his hand in his pocket. He just stands there, but the cool and proud momentum in him makes people feel that there is long distance between them
	"What's the matter?" The old master of the Lockwood Family walks here with Ian Moore. He glances at Carola, and then he looks at Jamie Moore with worries.
	Jamie Moore feels warm when she finds the old master of the Lockwood Family looks at her with worries. She shakes her head to show that she is fine.
	No matter how many misunderstandings and disagreements she had with the old master of the Lockwood Family, at this moment, what Jamie Moore feels is the warmth from her family.
	Carola is jealous when she finds the old master of the Lockwood Family looks at Jamie Moore with worries, instead of looking at her with worries. She walks toward the old master with her hand covering her face. Then she complains, “Master, please look at my face. I am pain...”
	But the old master of the Lockwood Family just glances at her, and he doesn’t show any care to her. Instead, he says, “If you feel pain, you should find a doctor. What are you doing here?”
	Carola has been used to this, thus there is no hatred on her face. She doesn’t leave the hall. Instead, she stands beside. She stares at the face of Jamie Moore with hatred. She wants to slaps Jamie Moore’s face hardly.
	Dan William frowns, and he says seriously and coldly, “Old master, I hope you can give an explanation for this."
	Hearing this, the old master of the Lockwood Family turns his eyes from Jamie Moore to Dan William. He looks at Dan William in a sharp and astute expression. Since this man appears, he stays beside his granddaughter. And he did everything for his granddaughter. What’s more important is...
	The eyes of the old master of the Lockwood Family become bright as if he finds something out. He looks at Ian Moore who stands beside him quietly, and then surprise flashes in his eyes. He understands everything now. 
Chapter 312: What Happened?
	This man looks like his great grandson very much. He should be the father of his great grandson.
	“You are?” The old master of the Lockwood Family asks.
	Dan William nods politely. He looks at the old master of the Lockwood Family with respect, “Nice to meet you. My name is Dan William. I am Jamie Moore’s husband, and I am Ian Moore’s daddy.”
	The young ladies presented here are all hurt by the short words of Dan William. The key is not that this man has a wife and a son. What's more important is that his wife is the young lady of the Lockwood Family and his father-in-law is the young master of the Lockwood Family. This is the difference. Who dares to fight for this man with them?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and there is a sweet smile on her face. Her eyes are full of sweetness. Although she knows they don’t get married. But he has given her enough sense of security since he says this in front of others.
	"You are the man who let Jamie sad and bring up Ian alone abroad. Am I right?" Anthony Lockwood frowns when he hears the word of Dan William. But he speaks in a low voice. No one could hear it except them.
	The expression on the face of the old master of the Lockwood Family changes suddenly. Then he looks at Dan William coldly, “What’s the matter?”
	The situation changes suddenly. Originally, the aim is Carola, but now the aim is Dan William. She has decided that she will forget the thing happened five years ago. If the grandfather knows this, he would not let her stay with Dan William.
	Anthony Lockwood wants to say something, but he sees that her daughter looks at him in a begging way. Then he changes the topic, “Daddy, let’s solve this problem first.”
	What he means is Carola.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family doesn’t ask more. He turns to look at Carola, “What has happened?”
	His voice is very majestic, and his whole body is full of power.
	Carola trembles. She looks at his sons in the hall in a hurry, but she doesn’t find them. Damn, where did they go?
	"Master, we can’t blame Madamm. It’s this woman who beats us first!” Seeing that there is something with Carola, Arlen runs here to help Carola immediately.
	Carola brings Arlen here from her mother’s family, thus Arlen is very loyal to her. This is why no one can bully her except the old master and Anthony Lockwood in the Lockwood Family.
	Thus Carola gets her strength immediately. As long as Arlen is here, Arlen will block everything they want to do for her.
	"Shut up! How could you act so rude in the front of the young lady? Anthony Lockwood says angrily. If he doesn’t have a good cultivation from childhood, he would slap Arlen directly.
	Arlen’s face turns pale after being shouted at by Anthony Lockwood. Then she shivers, and she puts down her hand in front of Carola.
	Jamie Moor bites her lips, and then she looks around. The music has stopped. People around them all stop dancing. They all watch curiously.
	"Arlen is my dowry maid. She wants to protect me. I’m the elder. How could you speak so ruthless in front of me? What do you want to do?” Carola is not a good-tempered woman. Thus she answers Anthony Lockwood impolitely. Now she doesn’t pretend that she is very kind to everyone.
	Anthony Lockwood sneers, “Second madam, you really know yourself well. Arlen is your maid, but she treats my daughter so rudely. Is it you who teach her to do this?”
	"You!" Carola wants to say something, but the old master stops her. The old master looks at her coldly, “Stop now!”
	Carola stops talking immediately, and the whole hall becomes quiet. The old master of the Lockwood Family is warning, and then he looks at Jamie Moore, “Jamie, what happened?”
	“Ah” Jamie Moore suddenly gets her sense. She presses her lips, and then she looks very sad, and there are tears in her eyes.
	“Grandpa, it’s...” It’s seems that Jamie Moore is reluctant to tell the story again. Now she looks so sad. People who see this will feel pain for this. And they are not willing to be too cruel to her.
	People who know Jamie Moore well will know that Jamie Moore is playing.
	Jamie Moore and Dan William look at each silently. Then Ian Moore covers his face. Mommy, you are so terrible now. I am afraid of this.
	The expression on the old master is getting worse and worse. He holds his hand tightly when he hears the insulting words toward Adele Gilbert. His eyes were full of anger. He stares at Carola who is pretending to be calm.
	Jamie Moore stops after finishing her words. She stands beside Dan William quietly.
	The old master looks at Carola after keeping silent for a while. Then he says, “You come with me now.”
	The expression on Carola’s face changes suddenly. She is afraid of the old master most in the Lockwood Family.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family walks out of the hall after finishing his words. Then he goes upstairs. After thinking for a while, Carola follows behind the old master reluctantly.
	“Mommy.” Ian Moore walks to Jamie Moore, and then he gives a thumb to Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore wants to pinch the small face of Ian Moore, but she finds that Anthony Lockwood walks to Dan William. After looking at Dan William for a while, he says, “You come with me.”
	Dan William looks up, and then he presses his lips. Then he rubs the hair of Jamie Moore. He gives an eyesight--I am OK--to Jamie Moore, and then walks away with Anthony Lockwood.
	"Mommy, will grandpa find trouble with daddy for that thing?” Ian Moore holds Jamie Moore’s hand, and then he sits near the window with Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore nods. It should be for that thing. Her father is dissatisfied with Dan William for that thing. He has opinion on Dan William before he meets Dan William. How could Dan William explain that thing?
	Seeing that Jamie Moore is in a puzzle, Ian Moore opens his mouth. He wants to say something, but he doesn’t know whether he should say it. After hesitating for a while, he says, “Mommy, in fact, when you are kidnapped to the island, I have told daddy the reason that Mommy left five years ago."
	Um?
	Um?
	Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she looks at Ian Moore with some helplessness.
	Naughty boy. Naughty boy. How could you make trouble with your mommy?
	Jamie Moore feels that there is a layer of cold sweat behind her back. She bites her lips unconsciously. Dan William knows this thing so early, but he could still get along with her quietly. He even doesn’t show any sign that he has known this thing.
Chapter 313: The Mind of Dan William is So Deep
	The mind of this man is so deep. Even she doesn’t find the thinking of him.
	She thinks that she has known him well. But now Jamie Moore finds that she doesn’t know Dan William well.
	“Mommy, will grandpa force Daddy to leave us alone? Ian Moore blinks his big eyes, and then he asks curiously.
	Jamie Moore rubs the hair of Ian Moore silently. It’s hard to image this scene. Isn't this usually happened to the poor heroine in the TV series?
	Dan William is such a boss of high level. This is not suitable for him.
	“Baby, you think too much. Please take some food for mommy. Mommy will wait for you here.” Jamie Moore pinches Ian Moore’s face, and then she says with a smile.
	"Mommy, it’s parents who should bring food for their child, and parent will take care of child well.” Ian Moore wrinkles his face, and then he complains deliberately.
	But Jamie Moore just glances at Ian Moore. She sits on the window, and then says, “Our family is an exception.”
	“...” Ian Moore doesn’t say anything, and he goes to take food for Jamie Moore.
	People presented here all have a new understanding toward Ian Moore. What’s more, Ian Moore is very handsome, thus many people look at him.
	Ian Moore walks to the table with food on it. He holds a tray in his hand, and he is choosing the food for his mommy.
	“Hello." A coquettish voice broke Ian Moore's mind, thus the food matching schemes in his mind all disappeared.
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and then he looks back. He sees a girl, who dressed in a pink princess dress and wore several shiny hair accessories on her head, stands in front of him. He nods politely, "Hello."
	"My name is Emma. Nice to meet you." Emma looks at the handsome face of Ian Moore with love. She reaches out her small hand in pink transparent gloves, and she wants to shake hand with him.
	Ian Moore doesn’t refuse her. He reaches out to shake hand with her. And then he continues to choose food.
	Seeing that Ian Moore keeps silent, Emma is a little unhappy. Then she walks to Ian Moore to look at the action of Ian Moore.
	"Why do you have to do it yourself? Why don't you call the waiter?" Emma looks at the skillful action of Ian Moore with confusion. It seems that he has done this for thousands of times.
	He is a child of noble family. Why should he do this? Emma is confused.
	"This is what my mommy wants to eat." Although Ian Moore doesn’t want to talk with this girl, it’s impolite if he doesn’t answer the question of her. Thus he answers.
	He doesn’t like to talk with the child from noble family. They are too delicate. They cry when they meet something. He likes girl of his mother’s kind.
	"Why doesn't your mommy bring it by herself? Doesn't your Mommy have hands?" Emma continues to ask.
	Ian Moore hates to hear the bad words of his mother. Hearing this, Ian Moore withdraws the polite smile on his face. He glances at the girl, and then he walks way with the plate.
	“None of your business.”
	Emma feels sad. She doesn’t get the love from the junior master of the Lockwood Family, thus she is a little sulky. She stamp her feet hardly as she looks at the back of Ian Moore.
	"Why did you take food with such a long time? Hanging around with girls? Jamie Moore almost falls asleep when she leans against the window. When she sees the plate in Ian Moore’s hand, she gets her strength immediately.
	She picks the plate in her hand and then she puts a piece of blueberry mousse into her mouth. Her face is full of satisfaction. Other people will get their appetite after seeing this.
	"No, I meet a little girl just now." Ian Moore presses his lips. He says as if he is an adult. He is so cute. And it seems that he is not a child at all.
	Jamie Moore laughs, and then she puts a rolled cake into Ian Moore’s mouth. “You are a little boy too. Don’t pretend to be an adult.”
	Ian Moore wants to refute the words of Jamie Moore, but there is food in his mouth, thus he can’t speak anything.
	Jamie Moore is in a good mood now. What she thinks is eating. She only wants to eat.
	Most of Paris can be seen in this location. Everything seems to be plated with gold. Paris at night is more beautiful than that in the daytime.
	Jamie Moore looks out as she eats the cake. The wind blows on her face, and the air are full of the faint fragrance of flowers. Thus she narrows her eyes comfortably.
	She even could see the lake in the opposite. It’s very quiet and peace.
	Jamie Moore looks around, and then her eyesight stops at somewhere.
	The man standing in the middle of the fountain garden...That man looks like Ryan Jack.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and she wants to see the man clearly, but she can only see the figure of that man. It looks like Ryan Jack. There is another man who stands in front of the man. The distance between them is very far, thus Jamie Moore can’t see them clearly.
	Jamie Moore waves at Ian Moore, and then she pulls Ian Moore to the window, “Baby, is that man your godfather?
	Ian Moore looks at the direction pointed by Jamie Moore curiously. But he doesn’t see anything, let alone Ryan Jack.
	"Mommy, do you mean that street lamp is godfather?" Ian Moore asks. “This is France. How can Godfather be here?"
	"He has also come to France. He is the one who comes to see me the day when we go to the manor of Lockwood." Jamie Moore says with confusion, and no one knows the true thinking of her.
	Ian Moore wants to say something. She looks downstairs, but he doesn’t see anything.
	In fact, there is a puzzle in his heart for a long time, but he doesn’t know if he should confirm it.
	Jamie Moore still thinks this man looks like Ryan Jack. But she is not very sure about this. What’s more, she doesn’t see him in the hall just now. So maybe she is wrong.
	...
	The party doesn’t end until 3 a.m. It’s too late. In addition, the old master wants to communicate more with Ian Moore. So Dan William and William can’t refuse. Thus they stay there.
	Anthony Lockwood choose to return to the manor of the Lockwood Family directly, thus the old master is a little sad.
	When Jamie Moore and Dan William enter the room prepared for them, they decide to have a rest after taking a shower.
	But Jamie Moore can’t fall asleep. She is curious about what her daddy said to Dan William.
	But Dan William doesn’t plan to tell her. He ignores the curious eyesight of her. Instead, he is reading a book calmly.
	God. She is so cute now. How could he ignore her?
	Jamie Moore wants to throw the book in his hand away, but she doesn’t have this courage. Thus she could only stare at him.
Chapter 314: Dan, I Feel Bad.
	Jamie Moore finds this is useless after staring Dan William for a while. Then she signs. She falls on the soft bed. She is as sad as a dying fish.
	“Dan, I feel bad.” Jamie Moore murmurs, and she wears a desperate expression on her face.
	Dan William stops his action, and then he closes the book and puts it aside. He reaches out to touch Jamie Moore’s forehead, “What’s up?”
	"I feel bad. I'm so sad." She continues to say, and she covers her heart with her hands. She blinks her big eyes, and she is acting cute.
	Dan William raises his eyebrow. He thinks this woman is a little strange. Since she took a bath after returning back to the room, she has been looking at him sweetly. Does she want to do something with him?
	If she knows what she acts to beg to know the words of her daddy was interpreted to coquettish craving, she would’ve choked to death. How could he think that she wants to do something with him?
	Does she look like a lecher? Is it right?
	Dan William presses his lips. He looks at Jamie Moore through his obscure eyes. The man has put his hand on her chest, “Is it uncomfortable?”
	Jamie Moore nods hardly, and she doesn’t realize that Dan William has started that with her, and he even does this audaciously.
	Dan William leans over suddenly, and then she approaches to Jamie Moore with his handsome face. Then he breathes to her ear, “It seems that you want to do something with me.”
	What?
	Jamie Moore is shocked for a while, and then she suddenly realizes the meaning of his words. Her face blushes, and even her ears become red. She looks very cute.
	"Who wants to do something with you? Dan William, can you keep your mind pure?" She punches Dan William’s chest bashfully. But in fact, her little fists are harmless at all.
	"It’s you who want to do this. I always keep my mind pure. It’s you who want to do something bad to me. I will meet the request of you. Isn’t it good? Dan William says with an expression of sacrificing everything for her. Seeing this, Jamie Moore even wants to strangle him.
	Who has an impure mind? She always keeps her mind pure!
	"Who wants the satisfaction from you? How could you feel that I want to do something bad to you?” Jamie Moore is very shy. Although she is shameless usually, now she is so shy, and she almost wants to hide herself in a hole!
	What a loser! You! Jamie Moore, are you such a loser? Even though you are shy, you should be a thick-skinned jerk in front of Dan William!
	But now she is pressed by Dan William, and she is wrapped by the light mint flavor on his body. If she could still keep calm, it’s not normal!
	“I see this with both my eyes. What? You have raised my lust. Do you want to escape now?” Dan William presses his lips, and then he moves close to Jamie Moore’s ear. Then he says sweetly, “No way”
	Then he kisses Jamie Moore before Jamie Moore answers his question, and then he kisses her hardly.
	When did she raise his lust? Jamie Moore rolls her eyes and then murmurs in heart.
	-
	Jamie Moore doesn’t get up until the noon of the next day, because she is too tired. Dan William almost makes love with her for a whole night.
	The old master of the Lockwood Family doesn’t ask somebody to knock on their door at the time of breakfast, but now it’s noon, thus he asks Ian Moore to knock on their door.
	Ian Moore walks to the door of Jamie Moore and Dan William’s room. He knocks for a while, but no one answers him. He wants to open the door, but the door is opened suddenly.
	Dan William, who wears a white T-shirt, rubs Ian Moore’s hair when he sees Ian Moore, “Good morning, baby. You mommy is still sleeping. Don't wake her up."
	“Oh”. Ian Moore smiles like a sly fox, "Daddy, Is it fierce last night?"
	Dan William stops his action, and then he looks at Ian Moore. His eyes are full of sweet and love, “If it isn’t fierce, how could you have a sister?”
	“Daddy, you need to keep going. I want mommy to give a birth to a little sister, then I...”
	“What do you want to do?”
	Ian Moore wrinkles his little face, and then he says with proud, “I will take her to learn swim. If she asks me the question--when mommy and her fall into the water at the same time, who would I save first--what should I do?”
	Dan William blinks his eyes. He is so familiar with this question. He remembers that someone has asked this question in the past.
	Thinking of here, Dan William remembers that Ian Moore has asked this question on the internet before he recognized him as his daddy.
	When the woman you loved and one of your most important things fall into the water at the same time, who would you save first?
	In fact, what Ian Moore wants to ask is that when the woman you loved and your son fall into the water at the same time, who would you save first? But he is afraid that Dan William will find something, thus he doesn’t ask this question.
	Now Dan William suddenly reminds this, thus he squats down, and asks with interest, “If your daddy and your mommy fall into the water at the same time, who would you save first?”
	Ian Moore is embarrassed. This is a question of a thousand years. How could his daddy ask this question? It should be him who started this question, is’t it? Daddy, you ask the question that I already asked. Is this good?
	He is tangled. Ian Moore has a deep love with his mommy. He loves mommy, and he also loves his daddy.
	Um...
	“You should choose one.” Dan William raises his eyebrow. He ignores the expression on Ian Moore, and then he urges.
	Now Ian Moore takes what he sewed. Dan William is amused, but he also wants to hear the answer quickly.
	In Ian Moore’s heart, who is more important? Does he like his daddy or his mommy?
	But before Ian Moore answers the question, Jamie Moore’s voice raises behind them, “Dan William, are you bullying my son?”
	Dan William feels helpless. It seems that this woman still has energy. It seems that he still could do something bad to her.
	Ian Moore relieves, and he runs into the room with his short legs. It's terrible. It's really terrible. How can he face the same "life-or-death choice" like other little kids?
	If he chooses daddy, Mommy will beats his little ass. If he chooses mommy, daddy will beats his little ass. He is in a dilemma!
	Ian Moore runs to Jamie Moore, and then he falls on the bed. And then he says to Jamie Moore, “Mommy, good morning!”
	Jamie Moore feels better after having a sleep. Then she stretches herself, and then she kisses the face of Ian Moore, “Good morning, baby.”
	Ian Moore dislikes this, thus he takes a few steps back, “Mommy, you haven’t brushed your teeth. Don’t kiss me!”
	Jamie Moore presses her lips. Naughty boy. She will kiss her hardly after brushing her teeth!
	Thinking of here, she stands up and walks to the bathroom. 
Chapter 315: Daddy Bullies Me!
	Ian Moore laughs complacently. But then Dan William holds Ian Moore’s back collar suddenly, and then Ian Moore is picked up by Dan William. The feet of Ian Moore are hanging in the air, and he struggles for a while.
	“Daddy, what do you want to do?” Ian Moore wrinkles his little face. If he knows this before, he would not come here to knock the door.
	Dan William looks at the bitter face of Dan William, and then he hugs the body of Ian Moore and says, “Baby, you should choose one. Daddy or Mommy?”
	Ian Moore wrinkles his face. Hearing Dan William’s words, he feels very bad. If this man is not his daddy, he will ask Night.1 to throw him out.
	But this man is his daddy, thus Ian Moore could only bear with this.
	“I choose...” Ian Moore looks at the eyes of Dan William, and then he shouts suddenly, “Mommy, Daddy is bullying me!”
	The voice is so loud that even people downstairs could hear it. But Dan William, who stands beside Ian Moore, just frowns. He doesn’t wear other expression except this.
	Jamie Moore is washing her face. When she hears this, she walks out quickly. Seeing that Dan William hugs Ian Moore in his arms, but Ian Moore wears a sad expression, she feels worried.
	She runs to Ian Moore without saying anything. She even scolds Dan William when she runs toward them. You are such a bad man. How could you bully Ian Moore? She feels pain.
	“What do you want to do to my baby? Ian Moore grabs Ian Moore from his arms and looks at him warily.
	Seeing that it’s time for him to do something, Ian Moore pretends to cry, “Wu...Mommy, Daddy beats my ass. I’m pain!”
	Ah! Ah, ah!
	Night. 1 and Night.7, who stay in the dark, is completely shocked by this.
	Ian Moore is so cute now! Just now, he was so strong, and he was full of momentum. How could the scene change suddenly?
	Ian Moore doesn’t know the idea of them. Even though he knows this, he doesn’t care about this. He hugs the neck of Jamie Moore tightly, and he pretends that he is crying. He even shivers, and it seems that he is really crying.
	But Dan William is very calm, and he is not scared by Ian More’s action. He looks at Ian Moore in a leisure way.
	“Does he beat your ass?” Jamie Moore shivers as she hears the words.
	In the past, he always beats her ass in the childhood....
	"Dan William, you are tyrant! It's not enough for you to hit me, but also hit my son!" Jamie Moore stares at him angrily, and then she hugs Ian Moore in her arms.
	Hahaha. Ian Moore smiles proudly on the shoulder of Jamie Moore. He looks very different now.
	"Stop. I did’t beat him. I just asked him a question.” Seeing that Jamie Moore gets angry, Dan William knows Jamie Moore will ignore him if he doesn’t explain this clearly.
	Naughty boy. How could you calculate your daddy. You will know the result soon.
	“What’s the question?” Jamie Moore is curious about this, thus she asks hurriedly.
	It’s terrible!
	Ian Moore opens his eyes widely. It seems that he is very afraid of this. He looks so cute now.
	“If you and I fell into the water at the same time, who would he save at first?” Dan William shrugs. And then he walks to pat Ian Moore’s shoulder with a smile, “Baby, you haven’t answered my question.”
	The body of Ian Moore is stiff, and he dares not look back. He expects that mommy...
	Jamie Moore finds that this question is very familiar...
	Yes. Ian Moore has asked her this question once. He even laughs that she doesn’t know how to swim. And then Dan William even takes her to learn swim, and Dan William says...
	His aim was that the child would not ask such question--if the woman you loved and the things you loved fall into the water at the same time, who would you save first?
	Ah. But now it’s not her but Ian Moore who should answer this question. She is curious about this question. Which one would Ian Moore choose?
	“Baby, you will save mommy first. Am I right? Jamie Moore pinches Ian Moore’s little face. She wears a big smile on her face, and Ian Moore even is afraid of this.
	“Baby, you should think it carefully.” as for this thing, Dan William doesn’t want to be a loser. Thus he pinches another face of Ian Moore, and then she says with a smile.
	Ian Moore presses his lips, and he rolls his eyes from time to time. Then he suddenly reminds of something, and he looks at Jamie Moore and Dan William suddenly, “Daddy, do you know how to swim?”
	“Yes, I do.” Dan William answers.
	“Daddy, since you could swim, why don’t you save my mommy? And how could you ask me--who don’t know how to swim--to save mommy? Ian Moore smiles like a fox.
	It’s right. Dan William knows how to swim. Why doesn’t he save her? Instead, he asks her son to save her.
	Jamie Moore narrows her eyes, and he stares at Dan William directly.
	“If I can’t swim, what will you do?” Dan William presses his lips, and then he looks at Ian Moore with a smile.
	In this part, he looks like Jamie Moore. It’s not easy for him to forgive others. He is so cute.
	Ian Moore looks at Dan William with a disgusted look. Then he looks aside and hums, “Daddy, you are stupid. You even can’t swim.
	“...” Jamie Moore keeps silent. This scene is so familiar. In the past, when Ian Moore looked down upon her, Ian Moore always says this words to her.
	It’s so great. Now Dan William also experiences this, and she feels much better now.
	“That means you can swim. Since you can swim, who will you save first--Daddy or Mommy?” Dan William is not Jamie Moore, thus Ian Moore can’t bully him.
	Ian Moore decides that he will ask Night.1 and Night.7 teach him how to swim when they return China, in this way, he can save daddy and mommy at the same time. And he doesn’t need to choose one.
	After figuring out all, Ian Moore is in a good mood. And he eat one more nutritious dish for lunch
	The old master loves Ian Moore very much. The old master prepares all dished for Ian Moore by himself. He wants Ian Moore could live in a comfortable environment.
	Ian Moore has a good impression of the old master. So these days, the relationship of them is very good. The old master pampers Ian Moore very much.
	What's rare is that Ian Moore is not proud of being spoiled. He is very polite all the time, which makes the old master very happy.
	They decide return China in ten days, but the old master and Anthony Lockwood miss Ian Moore and Jamie Moore, thus they stay there for another five days.
	On November 25th, they decide to go back to China.
	Five days later, it’s the engagement ceremony of Duke Field and Joey Lan. Jamie Moore worries Wendy, and Dan William thinks maybe it’s time to tell truth to Duke Field.
	But it has gone too far. Forget it.
	After flying for nearly 13 hours, they finally arrive in Country C.
	However, they hear bad news soon. When they just arrive at the manor, Derek William tells them a big news. 
Chapter 316: It’s Duke Field.
	It’s already 11 p.m. when Jamie Moore and Dan William arrive at the police station, and it’s almost 12 p.m. when they bail Wendy out of the police station.
	“Dan William, can I take Wendy to our home? I worry about her.” Jamie Moore says to Dan William who is driving.
	She knows that he doesn’t like other people enter his room, but Wendy is the best friend of her. They have been friends for several years, she can’t just leave her alone, and she can’t just send her home.
	Wendy leans against the shoulder of Jamie Moore, and she closes her eyes. It seems that she is very tired. Her breath is very weak, and there is even a red mark on her face.
	Dan William looks at the little face of Jamie Moore through the rearview mirror, and then nods, "You should make up for me some other day."
	Jamie Moore has been stayed with Dan William for so many days, if she still doesn’t know the meaning of this, she is really stupid. Thus she blushes, and then she doesn’t speak anything.
	Dan William just thinks that she agrees this.
	"How could this happen? Did Derek William tell you the truth?” Jamie Moore takes out a wet tissue from her bag to wipe the blood on Wendy's hands. But the blood on her hand has dried up at the time.
	“It’s Duke Field.” Dan William tells all the truth to Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore is shocked. She looks at Dan William. “What did you say? Duke Field?”
	Is it Duke Field who sends Wendy to the police station? Jamie Moore is very angry. She really wants to beat Duke Field.
	She really thought too low of him. He is so stupid, and there is something wrong with his brain!
	“Where is Eddie Charlies? Does he know that you are in the police station?” Eddie Charlies has such a good relationship with Wendy, thus it’s impossible that he doesn’t care about this.
	“It’s me who want go to the police station. I just did what Duke Field wants.” Wendy, who closes her eyes all the time, opens her eyes suddenly. She leans against the shoulder of Jamie Moore, and then says.
	Seeing that Wendy wakes up, Jamie Moore looks at the red mark on Wendy’s face. She gets so worried, “Duke Field is such a bad man. How could he beat you?”
	She really wants to go to the home of Duke Field, and beats him hardly!
	Wendy is very calm now, and then she says, “I should thank him. Now I don’t love him anymore.”
	“Jamie, do you know that I have thrown all the stomach medicine at home? I even bury the diary. and I throw all the lavender potted plants away too."
	Wendy’s voice is full of weakness, but in fact, she is very happy. She is happy for giving up a man who doesn’t love her.
	Wendy is not stupid. She will not be so inferior for a man. How could Duke Field trample on her heart repeatedly?
	Jamie Moore feels pain. Stomach medicine, diary, and potted plants——all these are related to Duke Field.
	She once made a joke with Wendy. If you can’t get Duke Field, will you spend your life just with those things?
	Wendy even tells her that this is the obsession from her youth, and she is reluctant to throw it away.
	But now she throws all the obsession away. This obsession will never be a part of her life.
	Duke Field, you missed such a good girl. You will regret it. I bet it.
	“In the past, Wendy spends all her life on Duke Field. She was really a goof.” Wendy puts her face on the arm of Jamie Moore. Usually, she would joke about her, “You have really huge boobs.”
	But now she doesn’t have any other strength.
	She will remember today in her heart. It’s the man she loved who sends her to the police station. She will never forget today.
	Jamie Moore keeps silent, and she hears what Wendy says to her.
	In fact, this is a car accident directed by Joey Lan.
	But Duke Field believes the words of Joey Lan, and he even gives a slap to Wendy, and he even sent her to the police station.
	The phone of Dan William rings suddenly. He looks at the phone, and then he turns on the Bluetooth headset.
	The voice of the Duke Field comes from the phone, “Brother, how could you bail Wendy out of the police station?”
	"Shut up." Dan William stops the words Duke Field without any hesitation. His face becomes gloomy. Derek William has told the whole thing to him. What’s more, Wendy has saved the life of Duke Field once. Now the action of Duke Field really hurts others’ feeling.
	“Duke Field, what are you doing? You send a girl to the police station. Duke Field, you are not a man!”
	Duke Field is confused. Eddie Charlies beat him hardly, and now Dan William also scolds him. What’s wrong?
	“Brother, Joey is just out of danger. If there is something bad happen to her, I will do something bad rather than simply send her to the police station.
	Dan William sneers, “It’s true that the Wendy Family always keeps low profile. Don’t you think they have power? You should know that the Wendy Family also has a strong family background as your family. You should not think too high of yourself.”
	“Brother, you are so strange. Did Wendy tell something to you?” It’s the first time for Duke Field to hear such words from Dan William. What’s more, he even speaks for a woman who hurts his girlfriend.
	“You should arrange yourself well. Don’t be cheated by the scene in front of you. Then you will lose the most important things in your life.” Dan William signs, and then he hangs up.
	He could only tell this to him. It’s Duke William who should make a decision later.
	When they return to the manor, Jamie Moore and Wendy sleep in the main room, and Dan William sleeps in the room on the third floor.
	“Wendy, are you sad?” Jamie Moore sleeps on one side of the bed, and then she pokes Wendy’s chest and then she asks.
	After taking a shower, there isn’t any blood on Wendy’s body. Usually, she can’t wear the clothes of Jamie Moore, but she loses weight for thinking too much recently. Thus she can wear it.
	“I feel pain. But now I worry about Eddie Charlies.” Wendy says worriedly.
	When she was sent to the police station, Eddie Charlies comes to take her away, and Eddie Charlies even declared his love to her, but she refused him with bad words. She even asked him to get away. Now he must hate her.
	Jamie Moore looks at Wendy with a nice mood, “Um? Are you seeing each other? Eddie Charlies is such a good man, and he is much better than Duke Filed. Why do you choose Duke Field?”
	A bad man should match up with a bad woman. They are really in a league!
	Wendy rolls at Jamie Moore, “Do you mean that I love a bad man? So I must be a bad woman, am I right?”
	Jamie Moore hums without saying anything. The meaning of her is very obvious.
	Wendy pinches the hand of Jamie Moore, and she says, “Jamie Moore. Do you want to be beaten? Do you want to be beaten?”
	“No, no, no. It’s the truth. What did you say to Eddie Charlies? Eddie Charlies is such a handsome man, and he even declared his love for you. Even though you don’t want to accept this, you should not refuse him with such a terrible excuse.” Jamie Moore laughs when she reminds the words of Wendy.
	Wendy is really strange. She refused Eddie Charlies with an excuse that other people can never think of.
	She refused: Your blood type is B, and my blood type is B. I'm afraid that if we have a child in the future, he will be stupid... 
Chapter 317: Pure Friendship.
	This is absolutely the most ridiculous reason she has ever heard!
	Wait...What’s the meaning of having a child in the future...
	Jamie Moore opens her eyes widely, and then she stares at the face of Wendy. Wendy is a little afraid of this.
	“What are you looking at?" Wendy puts her hands around her arms, and then he swallows saliva. She always feels that the eyesight of Jamie Moore is not very kind.
	Jamie Moore stares at her, and then she approaches to Wendy. She smells the smell on her body, and then she asks, “Wendy, have you slept with Eddie Charlies?”
	Wendy blushes, and then she feels hot for the stare of Jamie Moore, “Are you dog? So you can know the truth by smelling.”
	Ah!
	Jamie Moore pats on the shoulder of Wendy excitedly, and her eyes are full of light, “Ah. Is this the truth? You have slept with him. If I don’t ask this, won’t you tell all of this to me?”
	They develop so quickly. They just left here for half a mouth, and you have slept with him. Maybe you will give birth to his child soon or later.
	“I am afraid that you are surprised by this, thus I don’t tell this to you.” Wendy rolls at Jamie Moore, and then she pushes Jamie Moore away, “It’s an accident. I am also surprised by this.”
	Jamie Moore is surprised, and her eyes are full of light, “Have you drunk? My god. You stay with him alone, and both of you drink alcohol. If you two just chat with each other in the room and in the bed, I don’t believe this.”
	“It’s true that we are just friend before this thing happened” Wendy’s face is still very red.
	They are just friend before this thing happened.
	But now...
	Wendy feels a little sad. When she thinks that Eddie Charlies will ignore her later, she is a little sad.
	“Eddie Charlies loves you. Even I know this, don’t you know this? You are really a stupid, and you still see him as your brother. Stupid!” Jamie Moore pokes the forehead of Wendy in disgust, and then she says.
	How stupid Wendy is! She doesn’t know that Eddie Charlies loves him. And she even lets other people wait for her for so many days.
	Wendy pushes Jamie Moore’s hand away, and then she looks at Jamie Moore sadly, “I don’t want to think about this thing. It’s the engagement ceremony of Duke Field and Joey Lan in several days. She should let them compensate for this.”
	Jamie Moore raises her eyebrows, and then she looks at her in surprise, “Don’t you love Duke Field in the future?”
	“I don’t love him anymore. But now I know the truth well.” Wendy answers lightly.
	Jamie Moore thinks this is a good thing. Wendy doesn’t love Duke Field anymore. She would like to see this. Wendy is so good. Duke Field is not worthy of the love from Wendy.
	Even though Duke Field doesn’t love Wendy, he should remember the relationship of them. If they haven’t come back early, will Wendy stay in the police station for many days alone? And other people may not know that Wendy stays in the police station.
	Even though other people know that Wendy stays in the police station, they will not have any chance to take Wendy out of the police station. This is the personality of Duke Field.
	He is so ruthless. They have known each other for so many times. How could he ignore the relationship between them.
	“But now Duke Field hates you so much, will you go to the ceremony party?” Jamie Moore worries about Wendy. If Duke Field still makes trouble with Wendy, and he still wants to send Wendy to the police station, what should Wendy do?
	Wendy shrugs, and then she looks at Jamie Moore with a smile, “What are you afraid of? You are on my side, and you will help me, am I right?”
	Ah. Wendy, who is a strong woman, is coquetting to her...What a sense of achievement!
	Jamie Moore tries all her efforts to keep calm, and then she nods after thinking for a while, “OK. What help do you want?”
	“It’s very easy. You just need to borrow Ian Moore to me for a day. At that day, I will send them a big gift!”
	Jamie Moore feels that she will see a big play soon or later.
	-
	At the day of the engagement ceremony of Duke Field and Joey Lan, Jamie Moore finally understands why Wendy borrows Ian Moore from her.
	The engagement ceremony will begin at ten o’clock. Wendy and Ian Moore arrive at the ceremony at nine o’clock.
	They walk into the hall confidently. Then they walk to the room where is in charge of turning on the video of Duke Field, and then they close the door.
	“Aunt Wendy, what do you want me to do?” Wendy lets Ian Moore sits on the seat, and then he puts his bag down, and takes his laptop out of his bag.
	This is what Wendy asks him to take. He doesn’t know what she wants to do. It’s very secret.
	Wendy wears a big smile on her face, and other people will be afraid of the smile on her face.
	“I need you find a thing for me, and then we will replace the video of Duke Field and Joey Lan with this one.”
	“Which one?”Jamie Moore and Wendy tell him that Duke Field and Joey Lan are all bad. Although he is not familiar with this two people, he hates them.
	So when Wendy asks him for help, he comes here with her immediately.
	“Aunt Wendy told you that...” Wendy looks around, and then she whispers at the ear of Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore nods understandably, and then he makes a thumb. He pats his chest, “OK. Aunt Wendy. I will do all for you!”
	Wendy rubs the head of Ian Moore with a smile, and then she nods.
	At 9:30, the guests begin to come into the hall. At 9:50, the engagement ceremony is about to begin.
	Ian Moore and Wendy sits in that room, and they just watch the hall.
	At this time, the master of ceremonies stands in the middle of the stage. The pictures of Duke Field and Joey Lan are playing on the huge screen behind the master of ceremonies.
	In the picture, Joey Lan wears a sweet smile on her face. Although Duke Field doesn’t smile, the smile in his eyes can’t be hide.
	Wendy smiles. Bad man, I hope that you two are brother and sister!
	Ian Moore searches on the screen. Then he sees Dan William and Jamie Moore, who sit on the first row of VIP seats. He shrinks his neck and he is a little worried. If his father and mother know this, will they beat him up.
	“Atishoo!” Jamie Moore sneezes, and then she rubs her little nose. Who is scolding her behind her?
	“Have you kicked the quilt again?” Dan William hands a tissue to her, and then he asks.
	"How do you know this?" Jamie Moore wipes his nose, and then she blinks her eyes. She looks at him curiously.
	Then Dan William smiles and he approaches Jamie Moore illegibly. Then he says, “In the morning, you quilt is still on the bed. Who does this for you?”
	Jamie Moore is shocked. Everyday, she covers her quilt very well. Does it...
	Jamie Moore covers her face immediately, and she is very shy. She knows the truth now. It’s Dan William who covers the quilt for her well. Otherwise, she would have caught a cold. 
Chapter 318: I Hope You Two Can Be Brother and Sister.
	Can you stop saying such ambiguous words! What if she wants to do something bad to him?
	“Miss Jamie, you like to kick your quilt in the evening. You should be careful. It will be bad if you catch a fever.” The weak voice of Jozo sounds beside Jamie Moore. Jozo’s words like a basin of cold water pouring down from Jamie Moore's head.
	Originally, Jamie Moore is in a good mood, but now she feels bad.
	"Thank you, Miss Jozo. You care so much of my body.” Jamie Moore presses her lips, and then she wears a smile on her face. She looks at Jozo who sits beside her innocently.
	Jozo comes here with Dan William’s mother. Mr. William doesn’t like to come to such party. Amelia is afraid that she will meet Dan William, thus she dares not to come here.
	Mrs William feels very boring, thus she comes here with Jozo.
	Jamie Moore looks at the legs of Jozo. She thinks Jozo really has some advantage. After all, Mrs. William always helps her.
	At this time, Dike Field and Joey Lan walk to the stage. In the eyes of the outsider, they are really a couple.
	But in Jamie Moore’s eyes, she wants to roller eyes at them.
	“I hope you two can be brother and sister.” When Jamie Moore sees the smile on Joey Lan’s face, she murmurs.
	It should be said that Jamie Moore and Wendy has the same mind in this aspect.
	Dan William looks at Jamie Moore, “What did you say?”
	Be brother and sister? The mind of this woman is so strange.
	“Nothing. I wish they can live a happy life...” Jamie Moore laughs, and then she looks at the stage.
	“Where is Ian Moore?” Dan William looks around, but he doesn’t find Ian Moore. He remembers that Jamie Moore tells him Dan William has come here.
	“Um. He should be stayed with Wendy. You know that he doesn’t like staying in the crowd.” Jamie Moore shrugs. It’s absolutely that the face of Ian Moore will attract many people.
	If Mrs. William sees Ian Moore, what will she do?
	Will she take Ian Moore to the William Family? She really thinks too much. She is not willing to do this. What’s more, Mrs. William hates her so much now.
	If the William Family forces her to hand Ian Moore to them, she may do something bad back.
	Dan William feels pain in his eyes, and then he rolls his throat, and then he looks around.
	After changing the wedding ring, it’s time for the father of Joey Lan and the father of Duke Field to say something for the engagement ceremony.
	Today, people who come here are all the friends of the Field Family and the Lan Family. Although there are not so many people presented, but the layout of the venue is very good.
	Before the brother of the Duke Field finishes his words, the pictures on the huge screen begin to change!
	Jamie Moore is eating food. When she sees the picture on the screen, she is shocked.
	Ah! Joey Lan plays such an interesting picture in her weeding. Joey Lan is so generous!
	The audience all shouts. They all look at the screen. On the screen is the pornographic picture!
	In the huge screen, Joey Lan is kissing with a foreign man. And there are even pictures even bolder.
	In the picture, Joey Lan smiles sweeter than today. Especially when she makes love with that foreign man...
	“Tut, tut, tut, tut. Moral values are collapsing in present days, and the world is changing.” Jamie Moore says, eating the delicious food.
	Dan William is surprised for a few seconds, and then he blocks the eyes of Jamie Moore domineeringly.
	“What do you want to do?” Jamie Moore watches happily. She is a little unhappy when someone blocks her eyes.
	“You should not look at other men.” Dan William says in a low way. He covers Jamie Moore’a eyes tightly.
	Jamie Moore laughs as she eats the cake. This man is so mean, and she just looks at the other man.
	Now the whole hall is in a mess. Joey Lan crashes herself into shreds. It should be her who should gain all attraction today. But now they give them such a big slap!
	The guests under the stage all point at Joey Lan, but they are afraid of the Field Family and the Lan Family, thus they just murmur. There is still some people who aren’t afraid of the Field Family and the Lan Family, thus they scold loudly.
	The Field Family and the Lan Family is all in a bad mood. But they finally control the scene, and they ask someone to investigate it.
	“Ah! It’s not me!” Joey Lan looks at picture, and her face is very pale.
	“Stop now! Don’t play this picture!” Joey Lan picks the vase in the table, and then she throws it to the screen.
	If she doesn’t do this, other people may not believe this. But now it’s obvious that she has a guilty conscience. The woman in the picture must be Joey Lan.
	Duke Field stands not far away from Joey Lan, and he looks at Joey Lan, who throws the thing to the screen, indifferently. It seems that he never knew her.
	Although she smashes at the screen, the picture on screen is still playing. Finally, someone cuts off the power supply of the screen, and then the presentation stops.
	The eyes of Joey Lan becomes red, and she is ready to explain all of this to Duke Field, but then she finds Duke Field looks at her indifferently. She runs to hold the hand of Duke Field, and tears fall down from her eyes.
	“Duke Field, you should believe me. This is not me. Someone wants to frame me!”
	Duke Field doesn’t speak anything. In the past, he always looks at her sweetly, but now he looks at her coldly.
	The heart of Joey Lan jumps, and she loosens her hand. But she knows if she doesn’t explain all of this to Duke Field, she will never have any chance to stay with him again.
	“Duke Field, how can you believe me?" Joey Lan looks at Duke Field pitifully and sadly, and then she holds the hand of Duke Field tightly.
	“If that is not you, why are you so excited?” Duke Field says calmly. He doesn’t wear any expression on his face, and he looks colder than before.
	But Joey Lan knows that he is angry.
	She loosens the hand of Duke Field, and then she takes a few steps back.
	Duke Field just takes off the engagement ring on his hand coldly, and then he throws it away casually. Then he turns around coldly and leaves.
	“Duke Filed, you should not do this!” Joey Lan is in a hurry. The action of Duke Field means that this engagement is over!
	She can’t fall into the hell from the heaven like this. Otherwise, what she did before is useless. Duke Field only belongs to her!
	Jamie Moore holds the arm of the Duke Field, and then she looks around in a good mood. They choose not to engage in this thing, and they just look aside.
	Jamie Moore is curious about what will Joey Lan do to redeem Duke Field. Then she sees Joey Lan say to the back of Duke Filed, “Duke Field, if you don’t believe me, I will prove to you today that I am innocent!"
	Then she rushes forward, and hits herself on the pillar.
	"Ah. This woman is really cruel to herself!" Jamie Moore frowns. She feels pain when she just looks at this. Joey Lan is really cruel to herself. 
Chapter 319: Let Him Feel as a Stranger
	This is an effective method.
	True enough, when Duke heard this commotion he rushes over and he sees Joey lying on the ground bleeding on her forehead. Duke holds onto Joey and asks coldly, “Why did you do this?”
	Joey is now barely conscious in Duke’s arms, her hand grasping onto his jacket, saying pitifully, “Even if I did, it was the past. Duke, trust me. You are the only one I love now.”
	Duke is a little moved. The woman in his embrace had once taken a stab for him and saved him. He will never forget such devotion. But what happened today left Duke in a daze.
	The person that he loves is Joey but when all these were unfolding, although he cannot accept it, he is surprisingly not that hurt by it.
	All these years, does he really know her? Is she what he thinks she is?
	Once she set everything aside and took a stab for him. To think that she makes him feel so distant and desirable to escape?
	“Duke, you must not abandon me, have you forgotten? This, I’ll keep it for you.” Joey holds onto Duke’s hand and places it onto her stomach. “You cannot doubt my heart…” After she said this, Joey loses consciousness. She was so pitiful.
	Duke stares intently at that spot which was where she had taken a stab for him and left a scar.
	He didn’t hesitate any further and carries Joey out. The Field and Swift family members feel uneasy. The Swift family members follows Duke while the Fields stays behind to clear the venue.
	The engagement ceremony ended in this unfortunate manner. The strict Field family will never accept such a shameless woman into their family.
	Bunny and Wendy are already in the car waiting for Jamie and Dan. They two have just caused a huge scene and it felt so good.
	“Wendy, it appears that Duke still can’t bear to leave that woman.” Bunny says to Wendy as he leans on the window and sees Duke carrying Joey into a car and departs.
	Wendy’s whole body displays a single word: Satisfaction!
	Joey never thought that reality would come so quickly. She thought that because she likes Duke, she can allow Duke to become her soft spot but she has forgotten that it takes courage to truly love someone. Her love for Duke is but a dream, it will be over once she wakes up.
	“It has nothing to do with us. If she hadn’t antagonized me, I wouldn’t have been so ruthless today.” Wendy replies as she went on Instagram and thereafter Twitter.
	Bunny makes a mental note. He can offend anyone but women. It’s too scary. You can be caught off guard anytime.
	“But Wendy, how did you find these photos?” Bunny asks curiously as he turns towards her. As far as he knows, Wendy has always remained in C country and never left the country. How does she know that Joey had some history with other men?
	Wendy clicks on Eddie’s avatar and types a few words. She ponders over it and deletes the message. She didn’t know how to convey the situation to him.
	“Wendy?” Bunny shouts again.
	“What?” Wendy came to her senses and remembers Bunny’s question and explains, “Joey is not someone who can withstand loneliness not to mention waiting for a man for so long.”
	“Previously I saw her selfie on Instagram and in the glass panel behind her was the reflection of a man. So, I thought perhaps she may have a man with her.
	But the person who found the pictures was Bunny, she only provided the leads.
	Bunny nods his head. He thinks again that women are frightening. She could see the person in the glass panel and let him locate these pictures, truly… Can’t be antagonized!
	Wendy laughs sinisterly. Since she has offended her, she will have to take her revenge. Revenge is best served cold!
	As they were talking, Jamie and Dan walk to the car, open the door and enter the car.
	“Honey, come over.” Jamie sits at the front passenger seat and reaches over to Bunny.
	Bunny turns and gave Wendy a pitiful look. Oh no, mom knows that it was him.
	“Mommy, you’re beautiful today. One look and anyone can tell that you are a kind and gentle mother.” Jamie hugs bunny and he was quick to suck up to her before she could say anything.
	Dan was amused by what he sees thus laughs.
	Jamie returns an intimate smile and pinches his cheek, “Why, are you saying that your mommy is normally not pretty, not gentle and kind?”
	Bunny’s face pulled out of shape, he continues to praise her, “Who says so, mommy, you are pretty, gentle and kind every single day!”
	“Ah… you little imp really know how to sweet talk your way, out with it, how do you want to account for this, choose one.” Jamie wants to tease him. She grabs his chin and asks.
	But Bunny wasn’t really scared of her. He was just playing along and she actually wants to tease him. Does she think that he is so easy to be teased?
	“Mommy I despise you.” Bunny gives Jamie a look and pulls himself out of her embrace and climbs to the back seat.
	“You imp! Is your backside itching for a spank?” Had they not been in the car, she would have given him a good spanking.
	“Come to think of it, Wendy, what you did doesn’t seem to have any impact, it was too easy on them.” Jamie turns around and sees Wendy starting to laugh.
	Before all these, Jamie did expect Wendy to do something during their engagement ceremony but she didn’t expect it to be so simple and yet explosive.
	“Jamie, when can you be a little more intelligent” Wendy strings some words, steels her heart and sends out the message.
	After she said those words, she felt a cold stare shooting back at her. Even when she was looking down, she could clearly sense it.
	“Ok, you all just forget that I said it…” Wendy shifts to the side and cowers herself in a corner.
	Dan looks towards the road ahead. Jamie purses her lips and sighs. Damn woman, how dare she insult her intelligence.
	“Next month is your birthday. Will Eddie turn up?” Jamie crudely asks and looks sinisterly at Wendy in the rear-view mirror. Revenge cannot be rushed but a woman can’t wait too long to seek revenge. Just like Jamie definitely strikes back immediately.
	After Jamie said this, Wendy couldn’t resist but look at her cell phone. Eddie hasn’t replied. She instantly felt upset. 
Chapter 320: Cuckold
	Jamie smiles slyly because she knows that this damn woman always insists that she doesn’t like Eddie and was purely friends with him, ha!
	Doesn’t like? Why then was she staring at his picture the other day?
	Dan snickers, seeing Jamie’s sly smile. She looks so beautiful as the rays of the sun shines on her perfect porcelain complexion. Her eyes sparkles as her pink lips pursed. His heart starts to race as it feels heavy, weighed down by something unseen——the whole world for him. He smiles in content.
	It’s a pity that Jamie missed the moment as she hums a tune after getting back at Wendy.
	…
	Although the engagement ceremony was over for a couple of days, the incident continues to resonate. The news of the daughter of Swift family making a cuckold out of the son of Field family has spread across the entire A city. It became the talk of the town.
	Mr and Mrs Field are furious and broke off all contacts with the Swift family. Even an ongoing project between the two families was forcibly terminated. Mr Field also cut off all ties between Duke and Joey. He also restricted Duke to the house and till today is still fuming.
	Duke and Bruce are different from Dan. It is rumored that Dan will be taking over the family business. From the time the family business was renamed CR, almost half of the business was built up by him. Not only in C country, even overseas, he has a certain reputation and authority. From head to tail, he is not a person to be underestimated.
	But the Field and Hill families do not have the confidence to entrust the entire family business to their sons. Duke and Bruce are both masters of the household. At CR, their status was that of the General Manager level even though they don’t turn up regularly.
	Without a buddy, Bruce could only look for Dan everyday for entertainment. Jamie continues to work while Bunny goes to school as usual. Life got back to normal.
	Since the incident of Harriet and Jason, Jamie rarely received bookings and will not design wedding gowns for anyone. She focuses her heart and mind on CR’s winter season exhibition and its design plans. However, she never expected someone to find her in person and they were well known to her.
	“It’s so difficult to book Ms Moore and that’s why we came personally to see you.” It was Harriet and her fiancé Jason. Harriet brought some fine gifts and said apologetically with a wide smile. Jason on the other hand was out of place, restless, irritable and looked hostile.
	Jamie looked at them and rightly guessed what they were there for. She stands up and invites them to sit down. “You’re too kind Ms Chris, except that I no longer take any bookings, please accept my apology.”
	Harriet and Jason exchange looks, thereafter Harriet pulls Jamie’s hand, says apologetically, “We know, we were wrong those days. We were hoping that you’d forgive us.”
	“There is nothing to forgive. Ms Chris, please get straight to the point.” Jamie says calmly as she retracts her hand.
	If apologies were effective, why do we need the police? She will never design anything for such people again.
	“Let me explain. The other time Ms Moore repaired our engagement gown, everyone’s feedback was extremely positive. Many asked me where it was made. But we couldn’t locate you until today. That’s why we would like to trouble you to design for our own wedding gown.” Harriet says and smiles politely. Even she did not expect to receive so much praises for the engagement gown. On that occasion, every woman loved the gown and she was elated with all the attention from the start to the end of the ceremony.
	Before this, if she had known that Jamie’s wedding gown has such immense effect, she would never have agreed for Jason to lock her up. She had really offended the wrong person.
	Furthermore, they didn’t expect the Director of CR to be so protective of her. When Jamie was missing, he almost turned the place upside down looking for her. They now know how important this designer, by the name of Jamie, was to Dan. Otherwise he wouldn’t offend the Chris and Frank families because of one woman,
	Jamie maintains a calm and slight smile and did not display a hint of unhappiness. But within her heart, she was screaming hell. What kind of people were they? When she altered their engagement gown out of goodwill, not only did she not receive a word of gratitude, she was locked up and literally kidnapped and almost lost her life. Now they still have the gall to come in front of her and ask her to design their wedding gown? Fuck off!
	“I’m sorry, Ms Chris, I no longer accept any bookings. I’m afraid I have to disappoint you.” Jamie calmly says without any hint of animosity. She already presented them with her best attitude.
	“But…” Harriet wouldn’t rest, and was interrupted by Jason.
	“You’re only but a small-time designer, don’t be arrogant. Don’t you know what’s best for you.” Jason couldn’t control himself after seeing Jamie’s cold and indifferent expression. He said it as if he was doing Jamie a huge favor to design the gown for them.
	Jamie laughs within. If you are so capable, why aren’t you in heaven? Being a designer for so many years, she had rejected numerous bookings. Even if standing in front of her was the BOSS of FS, her previous boss, she will equally reject him if she is not in a good mood!
	“Mr Frank, please brush your teeth before coming out. If you are so capable, design it yourself!” Jamie is no longer smiling. She has enough of it and no longer bothers to be polite.
	Some people do not deserve to be treated with respect.
	Jason’s face immediately turns and he looks like he wants to viciously slash several cuts into Jamie’s face, “You’re capable? You are only but someone’s mistress.”
	Jamie bit down on her lips and her face went pale and frowned.
	Even Jason said that. Then what are the others saying about her and Dan? The person who they are criticizing and gossiping about must be her! Her smile turns to pain as if salt is being rubbed into an open wound. She was the one who didn’t want to get married to Dan. But why does her heart hurt so much when she hears others uttering these words? 
Chapter 321: Jamie’s Status.
	But they don’t seem to have any formal relationship.
	“Ah!” Jason who is standing across from Jamie lets out a scream which snaps her back to her senses.
	Jamie, in a daze, it was Dan. Dan continues to strike down on Jason with no hint of easing off. His expression is like a madman and the viciousness of the attack is enough to warn people not to approach.
	“Ah! Stop!” Harriet didn’t dare to approach and stands one side screaming for it to stop. But why would Dan listen to her? Another fist and foot lands on Jason’s body.
	“You dare to disrespect my woman? Let me tell you, if you disrespect her you are offending the entire CR. Go ahead if you dare to!” That last sentence was spoken softly but its message is full of threat and violence. Jason didn’t even dare to make a sound as he gasps for air. The expensive suit he had on is now soaked with blood attesting to how vicious Dan’s attack was.
	Only when Dan steps away from Jason’s back did he realize who is the man giving him a beat down! He was beaten up by a legend of the business world just because he insulted this woman! Furthermore, what Dan just said, especially that threat that Jamie will soon become the lady of CR. If they offend her, then they’ll offend the entire CR. This in effect has declared the status of Jamie!
	If Jason had known Jamie’s significance to Dan, who wasn’t simply a mistress, how would he dare to say anything like that to her?
	Harriet supports Jason up and they hurry out of the place in defeat. In her haste, she forgets to take back the gift that she brought for Jamie.
	Dan looks coldly at the gifts on the floor and collects them into a bag and throws them into the trash can. Thereafter he walks over to the sofa and looks at Jamie’s furry head. He lifts her head by the chin. His fingers touch the icy cold chin to Dan’s surprise. Frowning, he asks, “Why is it so cold?”
	Jamie didn’t answer but is distracted for a moment and didn’t hear his question.
	Dan’s frown became deeper, sits down beside her and grips her chin firmly, “Yes?”
	She could feel the pain and now she gets her sense to her chin. She looks at the man beside her and her mouth starts to pout in pity. But she didn’t say a word.
	Dan heard a portion of what Jason and Harriet said to her. Seeing her in this state, he could guess what she is unhappy with.
	“Why, my wife isn’t in a good mood?” Dan laughs naughtily and holds onto her hands. Her hands are as cold as her chin. Without hesitating, he lowers his head and presses his lips onto the back of her hands.
	Jamie enjoys the warmth being transmitted to her hands and then like being squirted with tomato juice, she starts to blush and her cheeks turn rosy. Even her eyes started to sparkle.
	“Who, who is your wife? Shameless!” Jamie wants to pull back her hands but Dan’s grasp is too strong. She struggles for a moment but is unable to break free. She starts to get sulky.
	“Who answers will be it. I didn’t mention anyone’s name.” Dan’s laughter is naughty as they come but his action was just so tender. It was as if he was protecting his most precious treasure. The warmth of these actions drove away all the chills.
	Jamie is able to see her reflection from those two big black eyes which are bright as stars.
	Dan didn’t bother with her tantrum but leans closer to her. His lips move close to her little ears and softly said, “If you are concerned about what Jason said, you shouldn’t. What I just said will happen very soon.”
	Will happen very soon? What does that mean?
	Jamie looks at Dan’s side profile as he is smiling to her. It will be the morning of December the first before she finally understands what he meant.
	If even at the entrance of the Registry of Marriages she still doesn’t know what is going on, then her intelligence is severely in question. But at this point, Jamie’s heart starts to race and can pop out of her throat at any moment. She is simply calming herself by saying that she is not excited.
	She holds onto Dan’s sleeve and looks at him coyly with her sparkling eyes said, “Dan, why don’t we go back and discuss this? Isn’t this too sudden?”
	She hasn’t fully awakened from the delicious dream and was ordered by him to dress up and come over and to the Registry of Marriages, no less!
	Is he having a fever? Was this because of what Jason said that day?
	Dan calmly looks at her petite face and his eyes beaming with joy says, “We are already here, are you going to waste this trip?”
	This is not the main point, whether they waste this trip is not the issue, BOSS! Jamie is struggling with herself internally, why didn’t he discuss this with her? He can’t decide this on his own. He only tells her what is going on when they arrive at the Registry.
	If she is not totally awake, she may have gotten married without realizing it and is taken home by Dan so easily? Can she be deceived so easily?
	“You can’t bring me here without telling me anything!” Jamie says as she bites her lips and begins to tremble from excitement.
	“So now you know! Let’s go in.” Dan picks up her hand and firmly grasp it. He was very calm and did not appear to be excited or anything.
	Jamie wouldn’t, she holds onto his hand but did not want to enter. “Wait, hang on, if you are doing this because of what Jason said that day, then you don’t have to. I didn’t take it to heart.”
	If it is really because of the incident that he registers with her for marriage, then it is no different from act of charity. She doesn’t want it in that manner.
	Dan pauses his footsteps and turns around to look at her. His eyes reveals a touch of stubbornness and seriousness. He looks at her seriously and pauses, then says, “Is this what you really think?”
	Jamie opens her tiny mouth and is about to answer but Dan continues, “Do you think that I’m a person who bothers about what other people thinks?”
	“Marrying you is because I do not want to wait any longer.” His voice is mellow, deep and charming like that of red wine. It is full of charm and warmth.
	“Wait for what?” Jamie bites down on her lower lips, her anxiety eases and is able to relax. 
Chapter 322: Together for Life.
	“To wait for you to prepare everything.” He replies. Dan intends to spend his entire life with Jamie, is this not a good enough reason?
	Jamie looks at the ground with her reddening eyes. Dan doesn’t frequently talk to her affectionally and when he does, he will anger her to the extent that she wants to strangle him. But today is different, she truly feels that she is being loved by this man.
	Though he is not good at speaking affectionately, she feels so completely overwhelmed by his sweetness today.
	…
	As they emerge from the Registry, her hand grasp firmly onto the hot off the press marriage certificate. As she enters the car, she feels surreal and wonders to herself, so I am now married?
	“Stunned?” Dan jokingly flicks her forehead. He starts the car and drives off. The marriage certificate radiates a strange sensation of warmth, warming up her heart.
	“No, this is a huge surprise.” She places the scroll into her handbag and zips it up well.
	If it was five years ago when she left him, she would never believe for a million years that she would be married to Dan one day. At that time, she absolutely hated Dan. How could she even imagine such an outcome? Even when bunny was born, she still hated him, although just slightly less.
	“You should be happy to catch a dashing and gentle husband.” Dan jokes, his eyes reveals his gentleness and warmth.
	He waited a long time for this day but thankfully, the wait was not in vain.
	That girl who used to love eating chestnut cake and shameless free loads at his house, the little girl who would cry at the slightest unhappiness, that naughty but adorable and irresistible little girl is finally his wife.
	Dan’s smile is as usual very faint but his grip on the steering wheel was very firm with his knuckles turning white revealing his happiness within. He knew that he was right by not giving up waiting for her.
	“Shameless.” Jamie says, she has not adjusted to her new relationship. In an instant, she became the rightful Mrs. William and she wonders how those women who crave this position will react when they find out about this.
	“Where shall we go for lunch?” Dan asks as he drives.
	Jamie ponders, tilts her head and says, “Let’s go to Bauhaus.” She misses the food at Bauhaus.
	Today is not a rest day but the restaurant is packed. Most of them have lived here all their life. Only those who are very familiar with A City will know that the food at Bauhaus is absolutely delicious. Normally the public would not hear about this place.
	Jamie looks around and there isn’t anymore empty tables and it doesn’t appear that anyone is about to leave. She is so disappointed.
	Dan notices her disappointment and calls out a waiter next to him. He hands him a name card, the waiter looks at it and politely stretches out his arm, “Please follow me.”
	Jamie’s eyes light up and Dan leads her up to a spot. She asks Dan in surprise, “There is a table here? Don’t tell me that you already reserved this spot?” But how can that be? How did Dan know that she loves the food here? This was the place where she came with Wendy secretly to eat and didn’t tell him.
	“Order whatever you like.” Dan didn’t answer her and hands the menu to her.
	Jamie took over the menu and looks happily at it but almost immediately she shifts her gaze.
	Almost all the dishes are connected to mushrooms. She detests mushrooms. She bypasses those with mushrooms and orders the dishes that she usually eats. She absolutely hates mushrooms to the extent that she doesn’t even want to imagine its shape.
	After ordering, she hands the menu over to the waiter and picks up a glass of juice. She looks at Dan who is still looking the menu and drinks the juice.
	“Jamie, what a coincidence.” A voice says. The location of the table is at a quiet spot and yet the voice is obvious.
	Jamie is surprised and looks around. True enough, she sees Ryan with that warm and sunny look. She was slightly surprise to see Ryan there, “Ryan, how come you are here?”
	Dan puts down the menu and looks at Ryan emotionless.
	“I’m entertaining a friend from France and didn’t expect to see you at Bauhaus.” Ryan points to a seat by the window. The table has a spread of untouched dishes. What surprises Jamie further is at that table, there are two foreign ladies.
	When Ryan points in their direction, she places down the wine glass and walks over with the other lady. She has a long red dress and elegant makeup. The long blond hair flows on one side of her shoulders. She is sexy and enchanting. But what surprises Jamie even more is the high heels she is on. They were peep toe and the heels were sky high and slender. The other lady beside her had a short elegant dress and looks twenty something. Her complexion is perfect. She was as beautiful as the other in her own way.
	Jamie purse her lips as they approach in front of them. Though they have thick makeup on, they are clearly beauties.
	“This is Lina Page and she is her daughter, Lisa Page. They are my newest partners.” Ryan introduces
	Lina Page and Lisa Page ?
	When Jamie hears these names, she looks at them in detail. This is Carola’s youngest daughter Lina Page. She was born a few years after the death of her father and is the youngest daughter of the Page family.
	Lina Page has nine percent of the Page family’s perfume business. She is also a very talented perfume concoctionist and is very famous in France.
	In fact, Lisa Page is not her daughter. Because her father died early, Lina had been raising her as her own. If one is to be accurate on the family tree, Lina Page is her aunt while Lisa Page is her cousin.
	In the past, her father said that they are touring the world and seldom return to the Page family. She didn’t expect to be able to meet them here, and they are now partners with Ryan.
	In that case, they should not know her ties with the Lockwoods. But she is uncertain if those two cheap uncles had ever told them.
Chapter 323: Rest Assured and Entrust Her with Me.
	“Nice to meet you.” Lina elegantly greets and Lisa does the same.
	They can speak this language well though it’s not too standard but familiar.
	Lina raises her hand and looks at the watch and says to Ryan, “Please excuse me, I have to go for another appointment. We’ll get together another day. I’ll leave Lisa with you.”
	“Rest assured and entrust her with me.” Ryan answers with a smile. He picks up Lina’s hand and gently kisses it with style.
	Lina nods and gives Jamie another look and leaves. That final look from her makes Jamie wonder if Lina already knows who she is.
	Ryan looks at Dan and Jamie and warmly smiles, “Dan, Jamie, do you mind if we sit together?”
	“Of course not! Let’s sit together.” Jamie laughs, she was about to go over and sit with Dan but she didn’t expect someone to beat her to it. It was Lisa. Jamie feels strangely unsettled and returns to her seat. Ryan sits beside Jamie.
	Dan frowns slightly as he smells the sweet scent of perfume emanating from his side.
	“How are you, I’m Lisa Page, very pleased to meet you.” Lisa nods shyly and says to Dan with a soft and gentle voice.
	“Okay.” Dan nods indicating that he heard her and turns his head away from her.
	Lisa’s face did not show any unhappiness. Her pink cheeks were getting redder by the moment. She was as beautiful as a flower. Jamie sees this and glares at Dan, transmitting a very obvious message, your eyes are wandering again!
	Dan gives her an innocent look, he is innocent, this lady sat down here on her own.
	The dishes arrives quickly but Jamie has lost her appetite. Dan seems to realize this.
	Jamie looks at Lisa and indeed she feels uneasy and can’t speak out about it.
	Competitor, she regards her as a competitor.
	Dan is a natural lady’s man and at the first meet, this little lady has instantly taken a liking to him. How will this develop? She wonders.
	But she’s being blocked by Ryan, otherwise she will get this girl to move.
	Lisa raises her head and looks towards Jamie and just nice their gaze locks in surprise and says, “Are you … uncles’ daughter cousin Jamie?”
	Jamie is about to take a bite and on hearing what she says, drops the fork in surprise. They already knew. But why didn’t Lina say anything just now? Furthermore, she has sat down for so long before she says this, can she be more direct?
	“Yes, I am” Jamie forces out a polite smile to Lisa.
	Lisa grasps her own hands and asks curiously at Jamie, “We have such fate to be able to meet cousin here. Let’s keep in touch.”
	“Ha ha, sure!”
	“Cousin, is this dashingly handsome man your boyfriend?” Lisa’s change in subject immediately turns to Dan.
	She is truly straight forward… Jamie gently raises her forehead and says, “He is not my boyfriend.” He is now her lawful husband.
	Dan’s face did not display any expressions. He already knows her thoughts. There was a soft glow in his dark eyes. Instead, it was Ryan who when he hears Jamie’s denial, starts to quicken his breathing. He looks at the Jamie excitedly.
	When Lisa sees Jamie deny their relationship, she feels at ease and laughs, “That’s good, so if I want to chase after this gentleman, will cousin give me your blessings?”
	On saying this, her blue eyes look directly at Jamie in anticipation. You want my blessings to come after my husband? If she doesn’t hang herself, Dan may do it for her.
	“I won’t, because this is your personal affairs.” Jamie laughs calmly. She continues with her meal.
	Dan purses his thin lips and looks at Jamie in approval. He too continues with his meal.
	Lisa is uncontended and pouts her tiny mouth. She wants to vent but because the person she likes is beside her and she wants to maintain her image, she can only endure.
	The rest of lunch was very sullen, no one spoke. Jamie feels that the dishes are bland and tasteless. She was halfway into her lunch when she feels a familiar pain. After pausing for several minutes, she realizes what the pain was due to.
	It was her time of the month. At least it is not like in France when they were in the garden and Dan instructed the chef to prepare some medicinal broth for her condition. This pain is still within her tolerance.
	“I’m sorry, please continue, I need to visit the ladies.” Jamie bite on her lower lips, takes her bag and stands up. Ryan stands up to let her out.
	Jamie enters the restroom and takes out a sanitary napkin and fixes it onto her pants. Although it is uncomfortable, she has to endure for she is a woman.
	Thereafter, she walked out to the washing basin to wash her hands.
	Her body temperature dropped slightly. Although she is wearing a white goose down jacket it cannot totally block out the cold wind. Once she touches cold water her fingers will tremble.
	Finally, she endures the cold to wash her hands, pulls out a paper napkin to dry her hands. Her back still feels uncomfortable.
	At this moment, Lisa comes out from one of the toilet cubicles and see her unhealthy expression. “Cousin, you don’t look well, why don’t you go home first to rest?”
	Jamie gently smiles and replies, “I’m alright, don’t you worry.”
	“How can you be alright? You seem very uncomfortable.” Lisa looks worried and holds onto Jamie’s hands, “See, your hands are icy cold. Don’t persist, go home and rest. If you are worried about that gentleman, I’ll take care of him for you.”
	Jamie’s mouth tightened, all that you said was because of Dan. She was just wondering why is she so concerned with her well-being.
	Beautiful men are always prone to incur admiration.
	“Okay, I’ll listen to you and leave first.” Jamie says and pulls back her hand.
	Lisa realizes that she is getting her way and says with anticipation, “Alright, then I will not see you out.”
	“Yes, I’ll leave now.” Jamie turns, leaves the restroom and returns to the restaurant.
Chapter 324: Are You Shy?!
	Dan William looks up and sees that she comes back but doesn't sit down with a pale face. So he frowned and asked" You look so bad. Do you feel all right?"
	"I am not feeling well. Dan William, shall we go back?" says Jamie Moore. She bites her lower lip and blinks at him as if she plays the woman, but her little pale face tells the truth that she feels unwell.
	Ryan Jack’s eyes anxiously settled on Jamie Moore and ask, "Moore, are you ok?"
	"I'm fine, but we have to go first. Please enjoy your dinner." Jamie Moore smiles at him and says goodbye to him. She takes Dan William's arm and leaves.
	"Aren’t you really lovebirds?" Ryan Jack looks at their backs and whispers softly to himself. “If they were not lovers, why are they so intimate?”
	But it is impossible that Jamie Moore would cheat him.
	When Elise comes out of the bathroom with a make-up, Dan William and Jamie Moore have left. She looks at the two empty seats and asks, "where are they?"
	"They have left." Ryan Jack shrugs, raises the glass on the table and takes a sip.
	"How is that possible?" Elise is a little annoyed, but in order to remain poised as a lady all along, she sits back unwillingly.
	Bugatti Veyron is driving on the road, but the way is not to the manor, but to Jamie Moore's apartment.
	"Please stop next to the supermarket. I'm going to do some shopping." Jamie Moore points to a supermarket which is not far away from the apartment, and Dan William quickly stops the car in front of the supermarket.
	After getting off the bus, they go straight to the supermarket.
	"What do you want to buy?" asks Dan William in a gentle tone. Dan William is rarely obedient to let her take his hand to stroll in the supermarket
	"Actually, I want to buy some sanitary napkins. We should buy some vegetables to cook the meal because my stomach is still empty. Jamie Moore drags Dan William to look for sanitary napkins on the shelf.
	Dan William coyly clears his throat and turns around not to look at the shelf. But he blushes scarlet at the opposite shelf because it is still the sanitary napkin shelf. He has no choice but to stare at the floor under his feet.
	After Jamie Moore quickly selects two packs of sanitary napkin of her familiar brand, she wants to hold his hand to leave only to find that Dan William bushes for his shyness!
	Really?
	Is he shy?
	And then she stretches out a finger to gently poke his red ear, and then chuckles. Sure enough, the ear is not only red, but also hot.
	When Dan William hears her laughter, he turns his head with a face flushed with shame. Seeing that she is laughing so loud, he puts his big hands around her waist and threatens, "don't laugh."
	Jamie Moore purses her lips and tries hard not to laugh, but she can’t help it. She laughs louder and louder so that she even can’t stand and finally she cannot help leaning on Dan William's shoulder and weeps the tears from her smiling eyes.
	"Dan William, are you shy?" Jamie Moore finally stops laughing, but the smile on her face was still obvious. She even stretches out her finger to poke his flushed face.
	How lovely, Dan William blushes.
	Jamie Moore suddenly remembers that Dan William has a thick skin. When she was a child, she seldom saw him blush. One time, without knowing she is having a shower, he rushed into the bathroom to look for her.
	At that time, his face was even redder, and he was at a loss to listen to her crying with a bath towel in her arms, trying to comfort her, but he was too embarrassed to go any further.
	At that time, they were just kids. But later, Dan William said to her seriously.
	"I'll be responsible for you. In the future, I'll marry you!"
	What did she do then? Since childhood, she has been more nice than wise so she kicked Dan William into the swimming pool though he was two heads taller than her.
	Dan William didn't expect her to do so at that time. He was kicked down by a little child without any precaution!
	In fact, Dan William was perfectly innocent at that time.
	But now he is even more pure. Accompanying a girl to buy sanitary napkin can even makes him flushed.
	"Don’t smile or I will kiss you!" Dan William picks up her chin with a grin and threatens her.
	Jamie Moore immediately shuts up and her smile suddenly wavers and disappears and shakes his head. "I will not smile"
	“This man is as good as his word to kiss her so as not to care whether it is in public or not.” Says to herself.
	Jamie Moore takes Dan William to buy some vegetables and some spices. She has not been to her apartment for a long time. There are no such things in her small apartment. It is better to move house at one time.
	If Dan William hadn’t reminded her, she almost forgot there are something in her apartment. Fortunately, the rent was paid for half a year, and her things have not been thrown away by the estate.
	This supermarket is not big. Seeing a handsome and noble man, several girls gather to talk about Dan William.
	"That man is so handsome. If he doesn't have a girlfriend, I'll chase him!"
	Jamie Moore's ears are very sharp. When she hears a girl saying that, she curls her lip. “Even if I am not his girlfriend, it is not your turn to be his girlfriend!” says to herself in anger.
	"Which apartment does he live in? I've never seen him before. "
	"Can you see the girl at his side? Maybe he visits his girlfriend."
	"Well, why do all handsome men have girlfriends?"
	"Maybe she is not his girlfriend, maybe is his elder sister..."
	Elder sister?!
	After hearing the words said by these girls, Jamie Moore hits the ceiling. She drags Dan William's hand down and gives his waist a hard tweak, saying "do I look so old?"
	Many people say that she looks so young? Are these bitched so blind with eyes covered with mud? It is obvious that Dan William looks older than her!
	Dan William hurts. Then, he looks at her and says with a spoiled chuckle "you are younger than me. Don’t care what others say."
	Jamie Moore murmurs discontentedly, but she gradually becomes happy by his words.
	After Dan William foots the bill, he and Jamie Moore walk out of the supermarket with several bags and go towards the parking lot.
	Although she hasn't been back for a long time, she quickly finds the key which is usually in the bag and opens the door.
	And there is no dust on the furniture. It's very clean.
	Jamie Moore steps to the sofa with slippers and lies down. She holds the pillow in her arms. Then he skillfully picks up the remote control from the table and turns on the TV.
	Dan William places these bags on the table, and his black eyes looks at the apartment. It is the same as when he came last time. Although it is small, it makes him feel at home and the style of the house is idyllic. It is very beautiful.
Chapter 325: You Want Me to Cook?
	"Baby's room is that one." Dan William points to the door which he tried to open but was closed.
	At that time, Jamie Moore was excellent to hide Ian Moore, and there was no clue for him to find him out. It was like she lived alone all the time.
	If Jamie Moore had not asked him to send her back he had not insisted on staying to take care of her, he would have missed Ian Moore again.
	This poor woman!
	Dan William has some helpless light in his eyes. He looks at Jamie Moore lying on the sofa. It's better to make it clear as soon as possible, otherwise the scar in her heart will become deeper and deeper.
	In fact, he deliberately waits until today. If he had told Jamie Moore the truth about what happened five years ago, she would have felt guilty and her love for him would have changed entirely.
	"Before that, make the meal ready." Jamie Moore takes the remote control and pointed to the bags of vegetables on the table.”
	Dan William stares blankly at her for a second, and then says, "you want me to cook?"
	"Yeah! or who else?" harumphes Jamie Moore. It’s the rival in love (Elise) who causes her not to eat well. He has to make it up to me.
	Dan William turns down the corners of his mouth and is unwilling to cook the meal. But thinking that she is at her period, he compromises and goes to the kitchen with the bags.
	"Well, don't blow up my kitchen. If you can't do it, just tell me." Jamie Moore suddenly remembers that last time how Dan William cooked. My God, he even didn’t know how to make egg fried rice!
	He just throwed the whole egg directly into the pot with rice together. And the rice was still raw!
	At last, the egg was fried!
	Jamie Moore doesn't trust Dan William's cooking skill who is a cooking rookie. He just doesn't blow up the kitchen here. No, she just hopes he doesn't blow up the few eggs that she bought
	Dan William in the kitchen doesn't say a word, but Jamie Moore is more worried. She stands the abdominal pain to sit up and looks at the kitchen with anxiety.
	She's worried that this rookie brother would blow up her eggs.
	"Dan William, please say something."
	There is no sound at all, which makes her very afraid. She wants to go into the kitchen and has a look, but also is worried that she would be affected.
	She has no confidence in his cooking skills. If she didn't suffer from her period and didn’t want to parody him, she would not let him step into the kitchen.
	"Do you throw the whole egg into the pot again? Please don't cook the egg fried rice again! Dan William 's favorite animation has been shown on TV, but now she is not in the mood to watch it. She is afraid that Dan William will be blown up.
	Go in or not?
	Struggle is going in her heart. Maybe she will be bombed as soon as she goes in
	"If you can't do it, just tell me, I'll cook the meal!" Jamie Moore puts down the remote control and is about to stand up.
	A cold warning comes from the kitchen, "sit down, watch your TV! Don’t you dare!"
	She is frightened to sit back immediately. With wide eyes, she looks in surprise at the wall that separates the living room from the kitchen.
	How does he know I stand up? Does he have eyes behind his head?
	Not daring to listen to the boss (Dan William), Jamie Moore selects some snacks from one of the bags which are bought secretly and wolfs them down happily.
	In order not to be caught by Dan William, she quickly fumbles a few bags of chips in the bags to satisfy her craving. He certainly doesn’t cook so fast and she will quickly eat them all.
	After a while, Jamie Moore is surprised to smell the delicious food wafted out of the kitchen. It doesn't smell like wicked cuisine at all.
	Jamie Moore pauses the hand with the bag of chips. She is so surprised that she slows down the speed of chewing.
	When does he learn to cook? She often stays with him and she doesn’t see he spend time cooking.
	She can’t believe that he doesn’t put raw rice in the pot and fry the eggs.
	Suddenly, when Dan William, wearing a khaki apron, steps out of the kitchen, Jamie Moore puts chips into her mouth, staring at the plate.
	"When do you learn to cook? " asks Jamie Moore when she swallows the chips and points to the plate in his hand. According to the smell, it should be shrimp with potato and chicken.
	Dan William lets his gaze drift over her and finds the snack in her hand so after putting down the plate, he takes away her bag of chips and flicks her forehead.
	"How dare you?" He says in a cold voice and throws the bag of chips into the trash can.
	Jamie Moore wants to take the bag back but stops when she sees his threatening gaze.
	"Show me all your bags of chips." Says Dan William. Without any negotiation, he holds out his hand to her. Although he is wearing a funny Khaki apron, Jamie Moore does not dare to laugh at him at all.
	Reluctantly, she pulls the remaining bags of chips out of the bag. Jamie Moore's is very unhappy because she could have eaten quickly them all.
	Looking at the garbage bin filled with potato chips bags, Dan William finally feels satisfied and smiles. He rubs her hair kindly and says "Darling, potato chips don’t taste good. Come and eat what I cook."
	"Maybe I would die from your food. Why do you pinch me?” Jamie Moore banters him. As soon as her sarcastic words blurt out, Dan William pinches her face and takes her to the dining table.
	Looking at the dishes on the table, her eyes become bright and she makes her mouth water. The dishes look so good. How about their taste?
	"Eat it." Dan William takes up his chopsticks and puts a shrimp into her bowl. Although he has a real poker face, but he is very proud of himself.
	In order to show himself today, he specially learns to cook with the chef. This woman will be moved to death?
	Jamie Moore is really moved because she doesn’t need to eat fried eggs and raw rice.
	But the moment the shrimp enters her mouth, her touched heart shatters.
	"Dan William, you put the wrong spices?" In silence, Jamie Moore puts the shrimp back and supports her head by hands.
	"Do I? What's the matter?" Dan William takes a glance at her and eats a shrimp. He stands in amazement.
	Too sweet.
	"You mistake sugar for salt. " Jamie Moore's voice is weak, and her hands shake.
	God, how can she trust his cooking?”
	Dan William feels embarrassed and intentionally gives a little cough for rectifying an awkward situation. He moves away the plate and explains "this is just an accident."
Chapter 326: Precious and Beautiful.
	It turns out that the thing in Jamie's kitchen that looks like salt is sugar——both white, so how is he to blame?
	"..."
	Fortunately, the following dishes are all normal, neither too sweet nor too salty, but Jamie doesn’t think that they were made by Dan. It’s so possible that 80% of them were made out quite normal just because he accidentally confused the sugar and salt again…
	After the meal, Jamie packs her things, returns the keys to the property center, and leave with Dan.
	It’s only six o'clock in the evening and a waste of time to go back like this, so she suggests getting off the car and go shopping in the nearby commercial street.
	Strolling around, the two couldn't help but walk to the high school they had both attended before. This high school is particularly famous in City A and is an institution of high level.
	She stretched out her hands and patted on the edge of the wall, calculating the height of the wall and the probability that she could climb over it.
	When she was in high school, she would often climb up and then get out from this wall with Wendy, and then run to the commercial street over there to eat delicious food they enjoyed.
	It's a pity that she can't go back anymore, but the memories become more and more precious and beautiful.
	She was thinking about it, but her body suddenly vacates, and her whole person was higher than the wall.
	Looking out from here, she can see an old tree by the wall. She was a little surprised. Why is this tree still here?
	"Go quick onto it! I can barely stand you weight." Dan's low urging sound came from below. She stops hesitating, holding the wall with adept, and then lifts her petite body up and then down, over it as light as a feather.
	Before Dan comes over, she quickly runs to the tree, looking for something.
	Sure enough, she finds it.
	A few words "Director Wang, Jamie is going to kill you" are engraved on the tree trunk. Although many years have passed, the traces remain unchanged and are still very clear.
	The handwriting engraved with the knife on it shows how angry the owner is, as if venting all her fury to it.
	"What are you looking at?" Before he knew it, Dan has already climbed over the wall and came behind her.
	For fear that he would see it, Jamie rushes out.
	No longer hesitating, Dan chases her immediately.
	Today is Friday. Almost all the students in the school have gone home. Some of the students who stay at the school are all on the third grade, struggling for the graduation exam next year.
	The night is dim, and it is December, and the wind blows on your face as if someone is scratching your face with a blade.
	Jamie is not a strong woman. He catches her at the middle of the playground and finds her almost out of her breath, gasping with her cherry mouth.
	However, Dan is still calm and relaxed, as if he was walking in his garden just now, his feet not rushing, and heart, so pleasantly tranquil.
	"What are you running for?" Dan slightly curled his lips, his eyes illuminating the street lamps around the playground, bright like stars, soft and charming light shining in them.
	Jamie gave him her rolled eyes, "Exercise after a supper." After saying that, she was breathing hard with her hands on her knees, gasping and blaming herself in heart for this toil!
	Seeing that she was really uncomfortable, Dan shook his head with lovable despise, stretching out his hand on her back to gently pat her.
	Finally, Jamie finally eases up his breath, but her face gets red by the cold wind, her body not warmed up from the running just now, but cooled down by the wind instead.
	Her period hasn't left yet, she almost forgot.
	Dan frowned slightly, untied the off-white scarf around his neck and wrapped it around her neck, softly reprimanding, "Why don't you wear a scarf when you come out. I won't care about you if you catch a cold."
	Jamie smirked while pursing her lovely mouth, a pair of charming eyes suspecting what he just said——she would believe anything but that he would ever ignore her.
	"That's all right." Jamie says, putting his cold little hands into Dan's coat pocket, and approaching him grinningly.
	Sure enough, Dan doesn't take out her little paw, but instead wraps her little hands with his hands. His palms are wide and dry and warm, in sharp contrast with the temperature of her hands.
	"Your hands are so cold! How much have you put on yourself?" He frowned, stretched out his hand and unzipped her top, and counted how the pieces of clothes she was wearing one by one.
	"What are you doing?" Jamie's small face suddenly turned red, and he quickly covered his clothes, zipped up, and looked at him defensively.
	But the expression on Dan's face was incomparably innocent. He looked at her, "To find out how much have you worn."
	"Yes, did you think so? perrrrvert!" Jamie's face flushes, and she stuttered such a sentence, pulling the zipper to the top, her whole body tense.
	Pervert?
	Dan raises his eyebrows and stares at her, takes out his hands from his pocket, reaches out and grabs her little hand so that she cannot escape, and then gently pulls her into his arms, using the coat jacket to wrap her small body.
	He leans close to her and sighs to her ear, "Before I was a boss, now a pervert?"
	Jamie's cold face is against his warm chest, and the whole person feels that her temperature is gradually getting warmer as if it is getting hot outside, rubbing against the woolen sweater on his overcoat, soft and comfortable.
	"Do you want to know, what is a real pervert?" Dan continues, and then reaches out his hand to cup her face, beautiful black eyes looking straight into hers relentlessly.
	Jamie is about to say no but is suddenly sealed by his lips, and swallowed everything she wanted to say.
	This is in the school, why is he so bold?
	She is now so afraid of being seen by others, can't help feeling nervous, and even her heart gets over-speedy. She stretched out her hand and punches his chest.
	While kissing Jamie, Dan freed up a hand and grabbed both of her hands, and with his forehead pressed against her forehead, gently and finely tosses his lips around hers.
	In a few seconds, her nervous heart was calmed a lot, and she starts to respond him timidly.
	Under the light, the two are kissing so ecstatically that they seemed to be coated with a blur of dazzling light, like a dream.
	"Who are the two on the playground? Which class? Openly kiss so boldly! I will report such a demerit!" Like a quack squeezed out of the duck's throat, a cry interrupts the lingering kissing people.
	The two separated immediately and looked at the person who came.
	"Holy! why is this old woman still in this place?" Jamie looked at the obese figure running towards them in the distance, somewhat speechless.
	This old woman was her former director Wang, known as the Destroy Nun, and now she has become a Beijing roast pig.
	God, she can see them so far, her eyesight is really good.
	Director Wang started running, the fat on her body trembled and he was particularly happy.
	"Let’s get off, it won’t be good to be caught by her." Jamie grasped Dan’s hand, seeing that the director has already run towards them from the stairs over there. It would be so embarrassing to be caught off guarding doing such thing.
Chapter 327: "You are Suspicious"
	However, Dan stares at her with eyes filled with desire and dissatisfaction, and does not move.
	Jamie was in a hurry, his little face blushed, as attractive as a cherry, "Dan, don't you screw it up this time, OK?"
	However, Dan snorted softly, and said with extreme dissatisfaction, "How do you compensate me?"
	What? Need to compensate?
	Jamie glances at the director who has already ran over to the playground. She grits her teeth and cries, "Let's go home first, you can make me make up whatever you want."
	Dan finally shows a satisfied smile, as if having been waiting for her to say so, and flicks her forehead, "Deal."
	At that, he takes her to get out of the playground quickly.
	Poor old Director Wang had to run desperately to catch them for she is never a woman cutting any slack.
	"Stop you! Filthy!"
	Behind, her roar gets much lower, and they smoothly gets out over the wall.
	"Dan, this is so exciting, do you think the old woman has run out of breath?" Jamie lays her hands to the wall and tries her best to withhold laughing tears, "After all these years, she is still the same as before."
	Dan stares at her for a few seconds, curls his lips slightly, then stretches out his hands to carry her whole person on his shoulders and walked back to the way they came.
	"What are you doing? So many people are watching!" Jamie murmurs and pats his back sullenly. She then buries her face in the scarf: it was too embarrassing——she is capable of walking herself!
	Dan snorted, and didn't care about the surprised eyes of people around him.
	Back at the manor, it was already around 9:30 in the evening, and Dan carried Jamie back to the villa again, attracting the attention of many servants.
	Bunny just came downstairs to get the milk to drink. When he sees Dan walking in carrying Jamie, he asks, puzzled, "Daddy, did you knock Mommy fainted?"
	"No, your mommy hurt her foot and asked for my favor." Dan says shamelessly, and he has not the slightest aware that bunny is just a kid.
	You slack, my foot is good! Jamie covered her face in shame and chooses to explain nothing.
	"But Daddy, you are carrying Mommy on your shoulder instead of holding her in your arms." Bunny pointes to his mommy, with the words "You are suspicious" written on his soft little face.
	Dan's expression is still calm, and he stretches out his hands to squeeze his face and says, "Baby, Daddy wants to cultivate relationship with your mommy, you go to bed obediently, and Daddy will give you a good thing another day."
	"What's the good thing?" Bunny blinks at him with those big eyes. He is really not that easy.
	Dan twitches at the corner of his mouth, and sighs that his son was really hard to deal with, and then smiles softly at him, "The graphic decipher data you always wanted."
	Speaking of this, Dan felt helpless but also very proud. The average child wants either toys or electronic technology products. His son has been pestering him about the decipher data of the inhabited islands.
	Sure enough, Bunny’s eyes suddenly brightened, "Deal!" After that, he moved away and let him pass.
	This is how she has raised a good son for so many years, and actually sold his mother for a set of shit information!
	Mommy, just pray for your blessings. Bunny waves a small hand at Jamie from behind and walked downstairs with a smile on his face.
	Get the information easily, handsome Bunny feels now very happy, he nearly leaps up to the sky!
	Entering the major bedroom, Dan didn't worry about his son’s interruption this time.
	Jamie is thrown into the soft bed, watching Dan who is undressing and swallowing his saliva, grabbing the sheets nervously, and retreating back, "You, you..."
	She just wants to say "what do you want to do" when she suddenly feels annoyed when she realized that just now, in order to avoid the director, she promised him that she could make any compensation when they get back.
	"What do you think I want to do?" He takes off everything and now with only his shirt and trousers. He unfastens the buttons on his shirt with his fingers, with a charming and enchanting posture.
	"I, I haven't taken a shower yet, don't come over!" Jamie covers her eyes and dares not look, but the little paw went against her wishes and opened two slits for her to peek.
	Well shaped figure!
	As soon as this thought came to mind, Jamie was pressed under him by Dan, and suddenly the picture just now zoomed in in front of him, making Jamie feel a little confused.
	"This is what you said, you can make up for it whatever I want." Dan gave a wicked smile, and pulled the scarf covering her face away, and then went to pull the zipper on her coat.
	Wait a minute, there seems to be something wrong!
	Jamie twists her eyebrows and suddenly feels something wrong. When she feels the flowing liquid bellow she gets it.
	Haha, God helps her too, it's really high time for her period to come!
	Thinking about it, Jamie doesn't resist for the first time, but instead reaches out and twines her arms around Dan's neck very actively, and actively kisses his thin lips.
	Dan was stunned by Jamie's rare initiative, and then he reacts. The dark fire in his eyes seems to burn her up.
	Jamie's clothes are now barely on her body. Seeing that the last step was about to be reached, she immediately pushes him away and rolls to the other side of the bed, innocently saying to his surprised and hot eyes, "I suddenly remembered, I’m just in period..."
	There was silence in the bedroom, Dan gets up from the bed, stares at her with deep and scorching eyes for a few seconds. Indeed, he has forgotten this just now and almost...
	No wonder this little woman would be so proactive today. It turns out that it was for this reason that she seduced him so unscrupulously, and nearly got the horse over the cliff.
	The fire within his body was extinguished a bit when she made such a fuss, but it has not been extinguished totally and he can only resort to himself.
	Dan held his forehead helplessly, his expression not good, with a forced depression.
	Jamie shrinks her neck and bites her lip subconsciously. Did she play too hard on him? He won't strangle her to death, will he?
	While worrying, Dan walks toward the bathroom. Jamie looks for a few seconds before lowering her head and dares not look again. He is walking around in front of her without anything on!
	But when she looks down, she is unexpectedly so torn out because all her clothes have been torn apart by Dan.
	Reluctantly and wrapped in a quilt, she goes to the cloakroom to find clothes.
	While Dan was in the bathroom, she takes out a few packs of sanitary towel from a drawer and chooses a large one for the night.
	She wonders if all girls have the same delusion as hers, that she always feels that no matter how tight they are use the towel to their butt, it seems to have leaked anyway and everyone is staring at her ass.
Chapter 328: Really Married.
	About twenty minutes later, Dan finally comes out of the bathroom, dripping from his pitch-dark hair, onto the blue bathrobe he was wearing.
	His eyes are very unkind, full of the two characters: desire dissatisfied. He glances at Jamie and walks over to the sofa to sit down.
	Jamie wants to laugh, but she has to hold back. She is worried that she would be frozen into scum by Dan's gaze in a second after she accidentally laughed out.
	It's terrible, and I will never provoke a man who wants it all the time.
	She hugs her clothes and walks towards the bathroom happily, but as soon as she walks to the bathroom door, Dan suddenly says, "Your menstrual period has always been accurate, and it will be clear after four days. I cut you some slack now."
	How could he even remember this so clearly?
	The cheerful expression on Jamie's face freezes in an instant, even she doesn't remember this kind of thing, okay, if it isn't for the scorching eyes behind her, she really wants to turn her head and ask him.
	Is your brain capacity too big? You actually have a place to remember such things!
	Jamie doesn't dare, so she goes into the bathroom with her small mouth lovely curled up.
	After the shower, Jamie feels refreshed.
	The lights in the bedroom were off, only the two wall lamps above the bed are lit, and the soft orange light falls on Dan who was half-lying on the bed. His eyes closed slightly, and his long eyelashes cast down on the eye sockets. With beautiful shadows, the whole body exudes a light and peaceful feeling.
	That handsome and innocent face seems to be born to amaze the world, and any adjective on him was not enough to describe it.
	Jamie pauses in her footsteps, then walks to the side of the bed, opens the quilt, and gets in.
	Within a few seconds of getting into the quilt, Dan opens his eyes, turns sideways and stretches out his big hands to pull Jamie into his breast, holding her soft body and squinting his eyes.
	His chin is against the top of her hair, and his low-alcohol magnetic voice carries a touch of imperceptible helplessness, "Let me bear it for too long, then you should be careful to bear the consequence."
	When Jamie hears this, she immediately lowered her head and buries her small face in his chest, his heart pounding very fast.
	Until now, Jamie feels that she is not dreaming this day——it’s real.
	She and Dan are really married.
	—
	The next day, Jamie goes to work with Dan as usual. Dan's car is parked in the underground parking lot, so even if they were in the same car, they would not be seen. Even if they saw it, there seems to be nothing to hide.
	But just after sitting on the office chair, Secretary Sam knocks on the door and comes in.
	The plan that Secretary Sam brought is about this CR winter fashion show, and Moon's intention to cooperate with CR to exhibit perfume and clothing together.
	"Who is the representative they sent?" Jamie looked at the plan. Now she is in charge of the fashion show, but would Moon send Jack again?
	And this time, she and Dan will be responsible together. In order to ensure that nothing goes wrong, now half of CR is preparing for this winter exhibition.
	CR's exhibitions will be broadcast live throughout Country C, and even all over the world, the current status of the exhibitions will be broadcast. Moon will want to cooperate with CR to launch the brand abroad, which is normal.
	"It's Moon's assistant director, Miss Elise." Secretary Zhang says.
	Assistant Director? Elise?
	Jamie also guessed that it might be Irina or her daughter. Couldn't it be for Dan?
	"Where is she now?" Jamie asks.
	"In the VIP reception room."
	In the reception room, the air is filled with the mellow coffee aroma. Elise picks up the coffee cup in front of her and sniffed it, then took a sip.
	"This coffee is really good." Elise put the coffee cup down and looks at Dan on the opposite sofa, picking the corner of her eyes, showing her flattery.
	"Miss Yi likes it." Dan closes his eyes lightly, his posture noble and cold, and his body exuding a sparse aura.
	Today, Elise deliberately wears a sexy sling dress, wrapped in a down jacket, and the indoor air-conditioning is very warm, so she took off her coat and put it aside, wearing only that sling dress.
	She casually and lazily plucks the hair behind her ears, deliberately approaches some sofa, narrows the distance with Dan, and then passes a plan between her fingers, "Look at me, this time I came with absolute sincerity, and I hope you could agree."
	Dan takes it and opens it, turning a few pages at random, without showing any emotions between his light eyebrows, which makes people unable to guess his thoughts.
	"Well, I will consider this." He murmurs, then put a the plan back on the desktop.
	I have to say that this plan is very persuasive and much stronger than other CR companies.
	"Are you still thinking about it? Why didn't Mr. Li directly agree, so how easy it is?" Elise thinks he might reject the plan, and a little anxiously walks over and sits beside him, with both hands on his arms.
	Dan looks at her hands on his arms coldly, frowns unhappily, "Please take your hands away."
	Elise can’t now hear his warning at all. She is now full of him. Before that, she thought Jack was already very handsome, but she didn't expect this superb man.
	This kind of man should be the knight before her skirt!
	"Mr. William, don't you really have any thoughts about me?" Not only did Elise not let go, she even holds him tighter, desperately trying to show Dan the two proud hills on her chest.
	Dan chills his eyes impatiently, and is about to stand up and throw away Elise, when the door of the reception room opened with a "bang".
	Jamie stands at the door with a dull expression on her face, seeing them both with opened mouths, but nothing said.
	But Dan's expression has not changed at all, as always, calmly and cool, the eyes that meet Jamie's gaze are not irritable or impatient, and there is no guilty.
	Elise sees that the person who came in is Jamie, her beautiful eyes rolls suddenly she struggles with words of resistance, "Cousin save me, this man just wanted to assault me!"
	When she said that, she twisted desperately. If it weren't for Dan's expression and eyes to be too calm, outsiders would really think he had done something to her.
	There are even miraculous tears in Elise's eyes, and immediately after struggling, she seems to finally break free. She retreats in a panic, far away from Dan.
	Dan doesn't speak, as if he hasn't seen Elise's false movements, those obsidian eyes stares at Jamie for a moment.
	After all, Jamie takes a step forward and walks towards her slowly, expressionless on her delicate face.
Chapter 329: Head in the Clouds
	She is about to say something when she walks in front of Dan and Lisa grabs her hand while crying pitifully, “Cousin, please take me away, this man is horrible, he just wanted to …”
	She didn’t complete her sentence but everyone knows what she means.
	Jamie looks at Lisa’s tear-soaked face and her lips pursed, her voice is chilly and calm, “What did he do to you?”
	Lisa winces and pretends to be embarrassed, wipes the corner of her eyes and says to Jamie, “Cousin, I know that if I were to say these it will affect the relationship between you two. But this man was just about to do something to me. If you didn’t come in suddenly, I may …”
	As she says this, she covers her face and continues to cry. She really looks like someone who had just been taken advantage of.
	Jamie laughs from the corner of her mouth, but her laughter reveals her suspicions. She looks coldly at Lisa and lifts her chin, saying, “Are you blaming me for interrupting your advances?”
	Her voice is so cold it sends chills down Lisa’s spine.
	“No, cousin, that’s not what I meant…” Lisa pitifully held back her tears and wipes her face.
	Jamie turns and looks at Dan who remains calm throughout, “What about you, don’t you have anything to explain to me?”
	Dan raises his eyebrows and sits back into the sofa. His dark eyes look calmly into her crystal watery eyes and say: “Do you believe her or me?”
	Lisa’s heart skips a beat and a bad feeling come over her. She becomes worried and looks at Jamie’s expression. It was calm, quiet, emotionless. She’ll believe me, wouldn’t she?
	Don’t all women of this country hold their reputation in high regard?
	“Cousin, he is not who he says he is. Don’t fall into his trap, you won’t be happy!”
	“Oh? Do you mean him?” Jamie looks at her and questions her in return.
	Lisa quickly nods pitifully. If it was someone else, she’ll believe her. But Jamie isn’t anyone else.
	“You just said that Dan was about to molest you? Jamie sneers coldly and with sarcasm.
	Lisa cowers slightly but she looks into Jamie’s dull eyes and perseveres, “Yes, yes … he was!”
	As soon as she says “Yes”, Jamie picks up the coffee cup and pours it over Lisa. She is swift and sure as if she had done it before.
	The coffee in the cup is still warm and steam rises from her long blond hair.
	But it is obvious that Lisa is scared silly and didn’t notice if the coffee is hot. She blinks and her blue eyes look in shock at Jamie as if something unbelievable has happened.
	“Cousin, cousin, you, you…”
	“Cousin?” Jamie scoffs, she then picks up another cup of coffee and pours it onto Lisa. This time she is slow and deliberate, as if to show off to Lisa.
	“I’m not your cousin. Please do not act as if we know each other well. We are not related at all.” She places the coffee cup down, bends forward and tilts Lisa’s head up with her fingers.
	Jamie, “Tsk tsk tsk.” She arrogantly says, “You said that my man wants to touch you? You? Please go home and look at yourself in the mirror. You look neither like a ghost or a human to be worthy of being touched by him!”
	Dan’s eyes were smiling warmly, he only has eyes for Jamie and no one else.
	Lisa’s deep red lips open in shock and sees herself in the reflection of Jamie’s eyes. She could see how pitiful a state she is in. She made a fool of herself in front of the man she likes.
	“He won’t like how you throw yourself at him. Furthermore, he is my man. If you want to entice him, ask me first for permission. If this happens again, it won’t be as simple as a cup of coffee.”
	Jamie flings Lisa’s chin aside as if a queen looks down upon the defeated Lisa.
	“You, you…” This action made Lisa feel extremely shameful. She was pampered from young, how did she end up with such treatment.
	It took her a while to accept her mother’s insistence to come and get close to this woman and now she is being criticized and even had coffee poured all over her!
	Lisa couldn’t endure it any further. She takes the proposal that is on the table and runs out.
	Just at this moment she runs into Secretary Sam who sees her running out of the reception room in tears. He gives way to her and then looks in surprise at the reception room.
	It shouldn’t be his boss who made this girl cry. When Ms. Moore entered the room, perhaps…
	The reception room is now quiet and Jamie takes up a napkin to wipe her hands as if she was in contact with some germs.
	Dan laughs softly, holds onto her small hands and pulls her into his arms. He looks at her hands which is now red from her repeated wiping, “Why are you wiping so hard, you’ll hurt yourself.”
	His voice is so warm and gentle. Jamie wants to punish him but she just could not bear to.
	She turns and grabs onto his vest and asks him seriously, “Where did she touch you?”
	She reaches out for a napkin and looks at him fiercely. She wants to wipe him clean.
	“Who knows what kind of germs is on that woman’s body. What if you’re infected?”
	How dare she touch her man. She should have poured another cup of coffee to dye her hair!
	Dan is amused as he sees Jamie reach unsuccessfully for the napkin on the table. He embraces her petite body and softly says, “No need to go through the trouble.”
	“Rip” with a firm tug, he tears off the sleeve that was touched by Lisa and throws it into the bin.
	Jamie swallows some saliva and she is fixated on his strong arms, she is being enticed by him.
	“Is my jealous little kitten satisfied?” Dan softly laughs, as he pinches her soft and silky cheeks.
Chapter 330: Beauty in His Embrace
	Jamie came to her senses and shifts her gaze away from the arm, coughs softly, “Barely acceptable, but then again, why didn’t you push her away when she touched you if I didn’t come in suddenly, will you allow it to go any further?”
	“I was about to when you entered.” Dan looks at her innocently, indicating that he is blameless.
	“A beauty in your arms, isn’t that great?” She jealously says.
	“How can that crazy bitch compare to my little wife, come, let me kiss you.” Dan’s manly moves are utilized and he tilts Jamie’s chin for a kiss.
	Jamie sneers, “Aren’t you afraid that last night’s tragedy repeats itself?”
	Dan froze, his black eyes stare at Jamie for several seconds and not only did he not relax his grip, but he also hugged her even tighter.
	He feels uncomfortable. Jamie laughs cheekily and her smile leaps.
	“No matter, in three days you can eat meat!” Dan pinches her cheeks and laughs.
	This man is a pervert! Why does he have to remember so clearly!
	“Oh yes, this proposal is brought here by Lisa?” Jamie looks at the proposal on the table and reaches for it.
	“Yes, the proposal is not bad. The only problem is the person.” Dan calmly says as he plays with her hair.
	“Oh.” Jamie remarks and opens to read the proposal. But after reading a few pages, she sees something. Wedged in the proposal is a love note.
	On it was a big red heart and a beautifully written message: You are my destiny, please accept my sincere and loving heart.
	She couldn’t endure it… fuck…
	My god, destiny, lovingly, sincere heart!
	Jamie took the card out with her hands trembling in anger. Is this woman’s head rotten? Who places a love note in a business proposal?
	Furthermore, looking at these words, it’s like she time traveled just to vomit them out!
	She turns around and shows Dan, “Have you seen this?”
	“Ya.” He nods without an inappropriate reaction.
	“You’ve seen it?”
	“No, I just flipped over it.” Dan reaches over to take the warped card from her hands. Tears it up and throws them into the bin.
	The card was wedged at an unimportant page. That’s why he didn’t take further notice of it.
	Jamie’s body is trembling and continues to look at the proposal. It’s a good thing there aren’t any more cards. This proposal was indeed good compared with another company. It’s a waste if they don’t cooperate. But if it was with Lisa then…
	“This proposal is good, are you considering cooperating with them?” Jamie asks. It doesn’t make sense to give up on a good business proposal because of a small incident.
	“The person responsible includes you. What do you think?” Dan instead questions her.
	“The concept is original and the plan is comprehensive, it benefits both sides, I feel that we can cooperate, but…”
	Dan completes her sentence, “but they have to change the person in charge?”
	Jamie laughs and nods, that’s it, if it’s still Lisa who knows what may happen later on. It’s better to change the person in charge.
	…
	At the Moon company, Lisa went home to change and her anger hasn’t simmered down. She angrily walks to the director’s office and is about to open the door when she hears some noise from within.
	“Ok, I know, rest assured Director Williams, we’ll be ready on the fifteenth of the month. Let’s work on this together!”
	It was Ryan’s voice, he’s on the line with Dan?
	Lisa waits for Ryan to hang up the phone before she enters the room. She looks at Ryan and asks, “Was it Dan?”
	“Yes, he has agreed to cooperate with us.” Ryan calmly answers without raising his head.
	Lisa was puzzled. From the situation just now, she thought that this proposal would be rejected. She wanted her mother to talk to Ryan so that she won’t get a scolding. But now…
	They have agreed?
	Don’t tell me that Dan is interested in her but he couldn’t express it when Jamie was there and he wants to use this project as a means of getting close to her?
	It’s very possible! This rekindled Lisa’s pride and is determined to use this opportunity to get Dan!
	“Ah, yes.” Ryan remembers, “Director of CR wants a change in the person in charge of this project. So, for this, I’ll personally be responsible for this project.
	Useless, useless, Jamie, can you get a hold of yourself? When up against Dan, you should prop yourself up and thicken your skin!
	But being pressed by Dan’s body, her perfumed petite body is already fully wrapped by him. For her not to be aroused, that’s abnormal!
	“I saw with both of my eyes, you lit my fire and now you want to escape? Dan snickers and softly whispers into her ear. He warmly and powerfully says, “don’t even think of it.”
	After saying, he presses onto her and not letting her reply, he firmly seals her lips with his.
	What? Since when did she light the fire? She rolls her eyes and resists silently.
	…
	Nearing the midday, because of the activities last night, Ms. Moore couldn’t wake up and hugs her blanket and slept soundly. Grandfather Lockwood was understanding enough not to let the servants wake them up. But it was approaching lunch and asks Bunny to knock the door.
	Bunny walks to Jamie and Dan’s room and knocks. No one responded. He was about to open the door when it suddenly opens.
	Dan was only wearing a shirt and on seeing Bunny, stretches out his hand to caress his head. “Good morning, your mummy is still asleep, don’t wake her up.”
	Bunny “okay” and smiles like a little fox. “Daddy, last night… was thrilling?”
	Dan secures his cufflinks and looks at Bunny, “if it’s not vigorous, how are you going to get a sister?”
Chapter 331: Have a Cute Sister
	“Daddy, then you must double your efforts. When mummy gives birth to a cute sister, I can…”
	“What can you do?”
	Bunny makes a small face and full of anticipation, “I can take her to learn swimming, what if one day she asks if mummy, daddy and she were to fall into the water, who would I save?”
	Dan laughs, this question is so familiar because someone once asked him.
	As he thought, Dan remembered that before he met Bunny, he asked Dan the same question.
	The person you love most and the thing that is most important to you fall into the water, which will you save?
	Bunny wanted to ask Dan, if the woman you love most and your son were to fall into the water, who would you save. But he was afraid that Dan can detect that it was him. So, he didn’t ask it in that manner.
	Now Dan suddenly remembers and was happy. He kneels down to Bunny’s eye level and asks, “If Daddy and mommy were to fall into the water, who will you safe?”
	Bunny froze, this eternal question… how did it come to being? It should be asked by him. Is it right for Dad to steal his favorite line?
	He was troubled, Bunny and mommy’s feelings are deeper and he loves Mommy but he also likes Daddy very much.
	Ah…
	“Quick choose one.” Dan raises his eyebrow and enjoys seeing Bunny’s internal conflict.
	This little boy is now made to choose and Dan is very amused and also waiting for his answer.
	In Bunny’s heart, who matters more, does he like daddy or mommy more?
	But before Bunny thought about it, Jamie interrupts, “Dan, you’re bullying my son, aren’t you?”
	Dan was thinking, wasn’t this woman thoroughly ravaged by him last night? Looks like she still has some strength.
	Bunny sighed in relief and ran around Dan into the room. Too scary, too scary. How can a little kid be asked the question of the ages?
	If he picks daddy, mommy will spank him. If he picks mommy, daddy will spank him. He was in a tough spot!
	“Mommy, good morning!” Bunny ran to Jamie and dives onto the bed. Lifts his head and looks at Jamie.
	Jamie feels re-energized with this sleep. She stretches and kisses Bunny on the cheeks “Good morning buddy!”
	Bunny backs off from her, “Mommy, you haven’t brushed your teeth, don’t kiss me!”
	Jamie smiled from the corner of her mouth, this imp, wait till she washes up, she’ll kiss his face till its full of saliva!
	She stands up and proceeds to the bathroom to wash up.
	Bunny laughs cheekily and his collar was grabbed by Dan who picked him up. Bunny’s feet are dangling in the air and he struggles for a moment.
	“Daddy, what do you want to do?” Bunny’s tiny face frowns, if he knows this will happen, he wouldn’t have come to knock the door.
	Dan looks at his frowning face, hugs his small body and said lovingly, “Come on, choose one, Daddy or Mommy?”
	Bunny’s face and mouth almost wrinkle into a bunch. He broke out in cold sweat when he heard this question. If this person wasn’t his daddy, he would have him thrown out. But this is his daddy, Bunny can only accept it.
	“I choose…” Bunny looks at Dan’s pair of menacing eyes and shouts out, “Mommy! Daddy bullies me!”
	The voice was so loud those people downstairs must have heard it. But Dan only raises an eyebrow and no other expression.
	Jamie was washing her face when she hears the shout. She wipes her face and hurries out and sees Dan embracing Bunny. The pitiful small expression of his made her heartache.
	She ran over and scolded Dan in her heart, how can he mistreat her precious son.
	“What do you intend to do to him?” Jamie snatches Bunny from his embrace. Takes a few steps backward and glares at him.
	Bunny saw the opportunity and pretends to cry, “Owie… Mommy, daddy spanked me, it’s so painful!”
	He cries as he hugs Jamie’s neck and sobs. He acted very convincingly.
	Dan was not scared by Bunny’s actions and calmly look at both of them.
	“Spank backside?” Jamie’s goosebumps raised as soon as she heard these words.
	Last time she was spanked countless times…
	“Dan!” Jamie stares at him, “It’s not enough that you spank me? You still spank my son?”
	“I didn’t touch him. I only asked a small question.” Dan sees that she is upset and quickly explains. Otherwise these two will give him the cold shoulder.
	“What question?” Jamie is now curious and quickly asks.
	“I ask him, if you and I were to fall into the water, who would he save.” Dan shrugs his shoulders, walks over and pats Bunny’s shoulders, his smile deepens, “Honey, you haven’t answered daddy.”
	Bunny’s body harden up and didn’t dare to look at him, he only hopes that mommy won’t…
	Jamie feels that this is rather familiar…
	Yes, Bunny asked her this question as well. In the end he was upset that she doesn’t know how to swim and thereafter she was taken by Dan to learn how to swim, Dan continues to say…
	To prevent your son from asking you, if he and the thing you love most were to fall into the water, who you would save.
	Gosh, this question didn’t fall upon her but now onto Bunny. But she was curious who would Bunny choose.
	“Honey, you will save Mommy first, right? Jamie pinched Bunny’s little face. Her smile was very bright till it scared Bunny.
	“Honey, you must think carefully.” Dan was unwilling to lose to this question. He pinches the other side of Bunny’s face as he smiles warmly.
	Bunny purses his lips and the black grapes big round eyes looks at both of them. In the end, he said, “Daddy, you know how to swim!”
	“Yes.” Dan replies.
	“If Daddy can swim, why don’t you save mommy and let me who doesn’t know how to swim save mommy?” Bunny laughs like a little fox.
	Yeah, Dan can swim, why doesn’t he save her and lets her son save her?
	Jamie squints her eyes and stares at Dan.
	“Imagine if Daddy can’t swim.” Dan says cheekily while looking at Bunny’s mischievous face.
Chapter 332: Blue Seductress
	This area he takes after Jamie, he insists on being right. It’s uncanny.
	Bunny now looks at Dan and turns away dismissively, “Humph, Daddy, you’re so stupid, you don’t even know how to swim.”
	“…” Jamie was startled. This was very familiar. Previously Bunny said the same to her.
	That’s great to let Dan experience it. She feels more at ease.
	“Looks like you know and since you know how to swim, if we and your mommy were to fall into the water, will you save daddy or mommy?” Dan is not Jamie, he won’t be bullied by Bunny.
	Bunny turns and buries his head into Jamie’s bosom and refuses to answer his question.
	The two adults laugh on seeing his actions.
	A week later, it was Wendy’s birthday celebrations.
	Today, with Dan not only is Jamie but also Bunny. They were with Wendy in the rest area.
	“Wendy is beautiful today, can Bunny have a dance with Wendy today?” Bunny wore a handsome little suit with a bow tie. He bugs Wendy.
	“Of course, tonight my first dance will be with you.” Wendy pinches Bunny’s cheeks.
	She is beautiful in her evening gown. It was specially designed by Jamie.
	“Nonsense, my son’s first dance must be with me. Don’t vie with me.” Jamie carries Bunny over and sits on another sofa, looking at her provocatively.
	Wendy stretches out her hand to tap her but the hairstylist was styling her hair and her motion pulled her hair and she winced in pain.
	“Tonight, you should be more ladylike.” Jamie teases her and tries not to laugh.
	Wendy sits straight and looks at the bemused Jamie. She can’t resist and says, “But come to think about it, you’ve always said that you don’t want Bunny to be treated specially by others. Now you brought him out like that, what if those paparazzi take his pictures?”
	“What’s there to be afraid, so what if they took his pictures, my baby is so handsome and photogenic.” Jamie laughs and pinches Bunny’s small face, she can’t get enough of pinching him.
	Bunny frowns and looks down and sees helplessly that his face is pulled out of shape.
	Wendy shouts, “Just look at yourself, has Dan used his charms on you? Otherwise why would you agree to bring Bunny out?”
	This is exactly to the point.
	Jamie and Bunny both give her a thumbs up in their hearts.
	Today indeed was Dan’s idea but Jamie had similar thoughts. Furthermore, Bunny wouldn’t be affected by worldly matters.
	“Oh yes, where are the presents?” Wendy remembers that Jamie hasn’t given her any presents.
	“I’ll give you later, I guarantee that you’ll be so satisfied with it that you’ll kiss me to death.” Jamie laughs confidently.
	Wendy rolls her eyes, “So long as it’s not like five years ago, the boxing bunny.”
	“Last year Mommy gave me a boxing bunny for my birthday.” Bunny added.
	It was cute but when Bunny tried to pinch it, it punched Bunny. Thereafter they modified it so that it doesn’t punch, otherwise Bunny won’t dare to touch it.
	Looks like Mommy has this obsession to give this kind of presents… Bunny thinks to himself.
	“Jamie, you do this to your own son! You vile woman!” Wendy glared at Jamie.
	Bunny was only punched once but she, each time she opens a present she would be very nervous. She had been punched several times…
	Jamie calmly returns her glare and carries Bunny out, “Honey, let’s go, let’s not talk to this old woman.”
	As soon as she finishes, the door closed with a “Clunk”.
	Wendy sees both of them walk out and looks at the watch. The event will start in twenty minutes.
	He, doesn’t intend to come?
	Jamie carries Bunny and casually explores the level.
	“Honey, afterward after Uncle Wales speaks, if that person doesn’t show up, you will go and invite Auntie Wendy for a dance, understand?” Jamie points at the round lobby and says to Bunny.
	“Honey understands!” Bunny pouts, his mother always worries over nothing.
	At this moment, the lighting dims, and the spotlight shines onto the red carpet. Mr. Wales and Dean Charlies stand on the red carpet.
	Wendy quietly stands beside her father and is all smiles.
	Mr. Wales is almost halfway through but Eddie is nowhere to be seen. Wendy finds it difficult to maintain her smile. It looks like he doesn’t intend to come.
	Very soon, Mr. Wales’ speech is over, and it’ll be the dance next. Below the stage, all the rich family sons are waiting to invite her for a dance.
	As Wendy stands on the stage, she looks around but she doesn’t see Eddie. Bunny saw Jamie’s expression and immediately walk towards Wendy.
	He walks to Wendy, bends his waist, and presents a rose. He then extends his hand and says, “This beautiful lady, can we have a dance?”
	Everyone roars in laughter.
	The cheers keep coming and not far away, Dan’s eyebrow rises.
	Bunny’s cute expression doesn’t change and ignores all their shouts.
	Wendy looks down and true enough it was Jamie’s son who dares to invite her for a dance in front of everybody.
	What a chance to dance with a young lovable boy!
	Without hesitating, she reaches out and holds Bunny’s hand. She bites her lips and winks at Bunny and walks over together to the dance floor.
	What?!
	Those waiting in anticipation for Wendy were shocked that she will give up on so many handsome young men to dance with a little imp.
	But when Bunny turns, the entire ballroom erupted. All eyes were on Bunny like spotlights. If he wasn’t dancing with Wendy, someone would have taken him for a close examination.
	“Brother, your son’s so intelligent, he already knows how to dance with a woman. In future, he’ll have no shortage of women.” Bruce praises as he looks at his little body dancing.
	Last time he will blush when he sees a pretty lady. Dan drinks some wine and smiles.
	Duke drinks his wine quietly and his attention drifts several times. He doesn’t even talk to Joey who is beside him.
	Wendy bends her waist and dance with Bunny. Although the tempo was off and seems more like fooling around, what everyone is looking at isn’t their dance steps but Bunny’s expression.
	Wendy was uneasy with the attention and said, “Bunny, they look like they are about to devour us.”
	Bunny’s tiny face didn’t change, “No worries, the first one they eat will be Wendy.”
Chapter 333: She Has Him in Her Heart
	Wendy is aching. She has to keep bending downwards to dance and they have not finished. She can only keep enduring the pain. She is starting to wonder if Jamie did this on purpose for Bunny to dance with her. As Bunny is dancing, he looks at Jamie and winks. Jamie gives him an OK signal and he leads her to the side.
	“Auntie Wendy, here is your present.” Bunny softly says and disappears to the side.
	“Bunny…” Wendy almost fell forward when Bunny ran off.
	At this moment, a hand steadies her and holds onto her. Wendy balances herself and looks. It is Eddie.
	All sorts of feelings rush within her.
	Eddie was not at ease and after he stabilizes her, he pulls back his hand.
	Wendy grabs onto his hand and looks at him directly, “Eddie, I’ve been looking for you for a long time.”
	He just calms himself down but as soon as he hears these words, a rush of emotions erupts again.
	In fact, she has him in her heart.
	On seeing that he didn’t say anything, Wendy thinks that he is angry. She holds onto his hand, “Didn’t you say that if I can’t get married, then you’ll marry me? Did you renege on your words? You liar!”
	Eddie came to his senses and on hearing that Wendy called him a liar, he looks at her and asks, “What?”
	Wendy’s eyes redden, and her nose starts to water. She releases Eddie’s hand and then falls into his embrace.
	“Bunny has done it!” Jamie raises Bunny’s hand and gives him a high five laughing joyously.
	Mother and son are about to leave when they were surrounded by reporters. She couldn’t move.
	Jamie held Bunny’s hand and pulls him in to protect him to prevent them from crushing him.
	“Miss, can you say what is your relationship with Mr. Williams. Is this your son with him?” A reporter places an audio recording pen in front of Jamie. The questions continue.
	“You and Williams have a son before marriage, is he an illegitimate child?”
	“What you did was because of getting something from the Williams family? From what we know, Dan Williams already has a person he loves. Is that person you?”
	“Do the Williams parents accept you? Have they agreed to have you as their daughter-in-law? Or are you and your son without namesake?”
	Are the mouths of reporters laced with poison? Each question got even more vile.
	Jamie is heartbroken but she maintains her composure and a slight smile. She had imagined such a situation this morning and hence she did not retreat.
	At this moment, Dan walks over. When the reporters see him, they open a path for him to walk through.
	“Master Williams, when did you both get married? Why wasn’t it reported in the news?” A reporter asks and the attitude changed dramatically.
	Dan stands firm beside Jamie, and says to the reporters, “As you see before you, this is my wife, Jamie and this is my son, Ian Williams.
	Bunny turns and looks at Dan with startled eyes, when did he change his surname?
	The reporters continue to ravage the family of three, the questions keep coming.
	“Master Williams, as I recall, Miss Jamie left five years ago. Little Ian looks like he is four or five years old. Can I ask if at that time you were already secretly married and gave birth to this child?”
	“Why did Miss Jamie leave? Can you reply?”
	Jamie looks directly at that vicious reporter, he guessed very accurately.
	“Yes, she left due to certain reasons. At that time, I didn’t know that she was pregnant with my child. If I had known, I wouldn’t let her go.” Dan turned and looked seriously at Jamie.
	Jamie turns her head and looks at Dan in amazement. Tears rushed to her eyes. What did he mean by if he had known that she was pregnant with Bunny he would never have let her gone?
	Did he mean that he accepts her child? Or was that just to handle the reporters’ questions?
	“It must be difficult on you to raise a kid on your own, Miss Jamie. May I ask if you thought about taking your child back to look for Master Williams? This reporter’s attitude was more respectful.
	Jamie’s mind was in a mess. She simply smiled and answered, “I was too young at that time. I was angry and thereafter I didn’t think any more of it.”
	“Little boy, auntie asks you, do you like daddy or mommy? Answer this and sister will give you a candy.” A reporter kneels in front of Bunny and asks. She is tempted to pinch Bunny’s cheeks but with Dan and Jamie around, she didn’t dare to.
	Bunny with his cute and handsome tiny face gave an adorable smile and said, “Pretty sister, my teeth will rot if I eat too many candies. Don’t use candies to trick a handsome little boy.”
	This question again? This question was asked by daddy and mommy and he managed to dodge it. Why this question again?
	The female reporter was startled at his answer. The cameras all started flashing in front of Bunny capturing his cute and handsome face.
	Bunny didn’t move much and let them take his picture.
	“Master Williams, can you answer again…”
	“Excuse me, that’s enough for today. Please don’t forget that the main cast is Mr. Eddie and Ms. Wendy.” Dan waves towards the dance floor and directed everyone’s attention to the dancing pair. His one hand embraced Jamie and the other held onto Bunny and left for the rest area.
	The reporters wanted to follow but didn’t want to offend Dan and started to move towards the dance floor.
	“Honey, go and sit down first. Mommy has something to talk to daddy.” Jamie says to Bunny and pats his face.
	Bunny looks at her for several seconds. Looks at Dan, and nods obediently, “Okay.”
	The two walked out of the ballroom and to an adjacent rest area. It was very warm and cozy.
	Jamie closed the door and was immediately embraced by Dan. Her chin was pinched by him and he whispered to her, “What do you want to say to me?”
	Jamie lifts her head, her petite face signaled seriousness and her eyes look anxiously at him, “Just now you said to the reporters and if you had known that I was pregnant with Bunny, you will never let me leave, why?”
Chapter 334: He Has Looked for Her!
	Dan sighs lightly. His hands on her waist moves up to her face, gently flips on it and says dissatisfiedly, "Why am I not reliable?"
	Jamie purses her lips and looks at him, saying nothing.
	"When I caught up with you, you had already gone abroad." Dan's voice is somewhat helpless. If he can, he really wants to pry Jamie's head open and have a look at the structure inside.
	At that time, she had no choice but to escape abroad.
	That is to say, he had looked for her!
	Jamie, you are just like what he says. You can't do anything but be stupid.
	"Don't look at me so embarrassedly. If you really feel guilty, compensate me." Dan caresses the corner of her eyes, touching her softly.
	Jamie doesn't speak, buries her red face in his chest, and bites her lips, not knowing what to say.
	Fortunately, she returns home, and they meet again. How lucky that he did not give up waiting for her.
	The only thing she can make up for him is to love him wholeheartedly.
	City A, as usual, is enshrouded in fluffy snow.
	The CR Winter Fashion Show is on play today, which is held on the third floor of Crystal Hall. The number of people invited is limited, only 250 people. All seats are occupied.
	Because the Show this time is co-host by CR's clothing and Moon's perfume, most of the people who come here are women, and some are dignitaries who accompany their female partners.
	"Hasn't Jamie arrived yet?" Dan is wearing a khaki sweater, a pair of black casual pants, and a black double-breasted windbreaker. The gold hem makes him look noble and elegant, plus he is tall and outstanding, Dan is like the male model on the magazine cover.
	He and Jamie should come together, but she forgets to take the suit that she took home the day before yesterday to modify the details. The show is held by her and Dan, so she asks Dan to come to the site first.
	"Mr. Dan, Miss Jamie just told me that there is a traffic jam now, so she would come back later." Secretary Sam stops his work and reports to Dan respectfully and politely.
	Dan nods and immediately goes to the balcony on the third floor. The falling snowflakes soon accumulate on his shoulders, and the cold wind blows by, so cold that as if it could freeze people.
	This winter is colder than before.
	Jamie is stuck in traffic jam on the road to the Crystal Hall, and the snow on the road almost covers the tires. If the road isn’t cleared, it would be very difficult to drive on the snowy road.
	She honks irritably, looks at the long queue in front of her, and feels depressed.
	If she gets late, she may not be able to catch up with the fashion show.
	About ten minutes later, the car still doesn't move forward. Jamie in the car can hear the noise outside. It seems that there is a car accident ahead, and the police are dealing with it. It may take another half hour for the road to be cleared.
	Half an hour?
	Jamie takes out her mobile phone and looks at the time. The fashion show will begin in 40 minutes. How can she get back to the Crystal Hall in ten minutes?
	After thinking for a moment, she puts on her coat, takes her mobile phone and gets out of the car directly.
	She feels warm inside the car, but as soon as she opens the door, the coldness outside also freezes her and makes her tremble.
	Fortunately, she puts a folding bicycle in the trunk, so that she can go to the Crystal Hall within 40 minutes if she takes a shortcut.
	She takes out her bicycle, wraps herself in the scarf, puts on her glasses, and takes on a shortcut to the Crystal Hall.
	Compared with the main road, this shortcut is obviously much smoother, and the snow is much less, so Jamie rides all the way smoothly.
	At this rate, within fifteen minutes, she will be able to arrive at the Crystal Hall.
	Jamie, whose fingers are frozen by the cold wind, is covered with snowflakes, but she does not know that a black car is following her for a long time.
	Dan finally leaves the Crystal Hall and drives back to find Jamie.
	On the halfway he found that there is an accident ahead, so the road is temporarily blocked, and he has to take a shortcut.
	Jamie doesn’t answer the phone, so Dan can't confirm where she is.
	After coming out of the shortcut, Dan's car can't go into those already blocked roads, so he stops the car and gets off to check it.
	At this time, the winter fashion show has already started, but the two responsible persons are away. Fortunately, Duke and Bruce are here, so the show can go on.
	Dan quickly searches for Jamie's car in these vehicles. Since Secretary Sam says she is in traffic jam, she must be here, and her car is a pink Ferrari, which is easy to identify.
	It isn't long before he found Jamie's car among the vehicles that are almost covered with snow. He walks over quickly.
	But there is no one in the car.
	Dan's face suddenly cools down and stares at the empty seat for a few seconds. Then he lowers his head and observes whether there are Jamie’s footprints in the snow.
	It snows heavily, but it still leaves some clues, such as Jamie's mobile phone accidentally falls on the ground, and the bicycle tire traces to the shortcut.
	Seeing these, Dan sighs with relief. He picks up the mobile phone left behind by Jamie on the ground, turns back to his car, calls someone to drive away Jamie's car, and drives off along the shortcut.
	He drives all the way, but he doesn't meet Jamie.
	Dan feels more upset. Halfway on the road, he stops the car and gets out.
	Jamie goes by bike. If she has arrived at the Crystal Hall, she would have met him. Judging from the time, she doesn't ride for a long time. It’s impossible that he can’t meet her.
	Dan bites his thin lips and his dark eyes search keenly on the snow-covered ground.
	On the road, he finally sees the tire trace of the bicycle sandwiched between the tires of his car, and it ends here. It didn’t park normally.
	Traces on the ground are messy, like she was forced to stop, and there are also traces of another car.
	Dan squats down and carefully distinguishes the traces on the ground. They’re not from his tires. His tires are different from ordinary cars. Because they are specially customized, they are very different and can be recognized at a glance.
	Jamie stopped when she rode to this position, and there are footprints, not just Jamie's footprints alone, but several people’s.
	Who forcibly took Jamie away, and someone Jamie knows well?
	Although there are many footprints, they are not messy, which proves that they are familiar to Jamie, and Jamie volunteers to follow those people.
Chapter 335: Thanks, Mr. Ryan
	Who could it be that she would rather miss the exhibition?
	Dan's eyes are cold. He stands up and looks around calmly. There are few pedestrians and vehicles here, which are negligible compared with those on the road.
	Since those people would follow her all the way, it's very likely that when Jamie has been here, they took her away.
	He takes out his mobile phone and makes a phone call to Derek who is still at the Crystal Hall.
	Dan drives back to the Crystal Hall and sees Jamie talking with Ryan at the front door of the Crystal Hall.
	Derek just reported that Jamie came back in Ryan's car less than five minutes after he left the Crystal Hall.
	He feels relieved. Looking at the figure standing on the stairs, he calms down and walks towards her.
	Jamie met Ryan on the way. Lina is also in his car. Because of the traffic jam, they chose a shortcut like her.
	It's just that they are luckier than her. They can drive out the traffic jam, but she can only ride her bicycle.
	It’s not lucky to ride a bicycle in the wind and snow.
	"Let's go in first. It's too cold outside." Ryan looks warm with his hands in the pockets and a dark red scarf around his neck.
	When Jamie is about to agree, she sees Dan coming up the stairs. "Dan, how did you just come there? Didn’t you get here before me?"
	Dan walks to her, staring at her for a few seconds before reaching out and fiddling away the snowflakes on the scarf in her hair. He doesn’t overlook even the slightest place.
	Jamie’s face is a little pale, probably because she has been blowing in the cold wind for too long. She looks as if she is going to freeze, and she can't help shivering.
	"There is heating inside. Why don't you go in?" Dan touches her face gently and blames her.
	"Oh, I forgot it. I'm going in now." Jamie is a bit shocked, then smiles sweetly.
	Dan nods slightly, then turns to look at Ryan. In his deep and bright black eyes, no one can guess what’s in his mind, but he looks more serious than before, "Thank you, Mr. Ryan."
	Ryan watches the interaction between Dan and Jamie. He wants to ask Jamie whether the report two days ago was true, but now he has known the answer.
	The get married.
	It is undoubtedly a bolt from the blue for Ryan. It’s too late now. He had a chance when he was in England, but he missed it.
	That's why Jamie would be with Dan again.
	His smile suddenly becomes a little sad, and there is not a trace of warmth in his eyes. His hands at his side are clenched tightly.
	"You are welcome. This is what I should do." Then he smiles again, looking at Dan aggressively
	Dan, for sure, could hear the provocation in his tone, and he smiles, "As her husband, I should thank you for her."
	Ryan looks at the dangerous and possessive man in front of him.
	Jamie doesn't know what’s happening between them, only thinks that Ryan regards her as a friend, and friends don't have to pay too much attention of the trivial things.
	The show starts. Ryan, the representative of Moon, goes back to the third floor, while CR, with Duke and Bruce here, doesn't need to worry too much. Jamie and Dan walk up the stairs leisurely.
	The red carpet on the stairs of Crystal Hall is soft and won't make a sound.
	"When did you meet Ryan? I have never heard you mention it." Dan suddenly asks.
	Jamie withdraws her eyes from the carpet and looks at Dan, and asks, "I met him when bunny was three years old. Because we are compatriots, we soon become friends."
	"Ian seems to like him very much." Dan says casually, and gently pinches Jamie's little hand which is also in his pocket.
	"You're not jealous, are you?" Jamie laughs, "Probably because Ryan once saved him. We have always appreciated him."
	Dan looks serious, and clenches his hand, "Ryan saved Ian?"
	"You know that there are many underground organizations abroad. If they take a fancy to a child's talent, they will take the baby away for their use." That is the last thing Jamie wants to think about
	"Those people will dress up as any kind of people, just to achieve their goals. Fortunately, the place where we lived at that time was an apartment with good law and order, but those people still managed to approach us everywhere."
	Jamie had to work at that time and couldn't take care of bunny, so she sent him to kindergarten, but bunny is calm and seldom cries, which saves Jamie a lot of troubles.
	Bunny has a very high talent and intelligent mind since childhood, and he looks like a porcelain doll. Even his teachers are full of praise for him, which has caused many troubles.
	In Jamie's memory, bunny loves those funky toys in the window. Those people take advantage of the loopholes and almost took bunny away.
	Fortunately, she met Ryan.
	At that time, Ryan was just a designer of a British construction company. He just passed by that place and gave them a hand. She didn’t expect that both of them are from Country C, and as time goes by, they become friends.
	"He really showed up in time." Hearing that, Dan hooks his lips and smiles, reaching out and taking out the hair that accidentally enters Jamie's mouth.
	"Yes, few people pass by that place, but fortunately he lived nearby." Jamie sighs. Her hand reaches deeper into Dan's pocket and holds his hand tightly, trying to warm her hand up.
	Dan smiles, but says nothing, and then goes up to the third floor with her.
	The show has already started, because Jamie was not present just now, Duke and Bruce decided to remove the first part and let the models start the catwalk show.
	Glittering snowflakes are falling down constantly, and there is a snowman of adult height in the center of the huge runway, with a black hat and tie on his head, like a gentleman.
	The atmosphere is great, and every guest's enthusiasm is on fire.
	This winter fashion show is divided into three parts. The first and the final ones are most excited, and the final will come out later.
Chapter 336: My Husband is the Best
	"My parents have always wanted to see you." Dan looks at the screen on his phone as he stands next to Jamie.
	Jamie is appalled. She was busy with today's affairs in the past two days, and didn't go back to the manor. Moreover, Dan’s parents have never told her that they want to see her and bunny, and they didn’t question the things between them, which makes her feel very surprised.
	"What they want to see most is Ian." Jamie's says lightly, looking down at the runaway.
	"I told them that you are busy these days. If they want to see you, they have to wait until tomorrow." Dan smiles evilly, slips his arms around her waist and rests his chin on her shoulder.
	"No wonder it's been so calm these two days, and they didn't question me. My husband is the best." Jamie says, and turns to kiss him on the chin.
	Dan is very satisfied with her calling him husband. Squinting his black eyes, Dan lowers his head and kisses on the cherry pink lips, as if nobody is watching them.
	"Oh..."Jamie bashes him shyly on the chest, then pushes him away and then buries her face in his coat.
	The lights are now on the stage, and all eyes are on the models, so that no one could see what they are doing.
	"Do you want to suffocate yourself?" Dan chuckles, pulls her out of his arms and stares at her little red face.
	This little woman has a thick face, but every time he kisses her, her face would brush and she would feel embarrassed.
	When she acts like this, he wants to tease her more.
	"Who... who let you kiss me? Don't you see so many people here?" Jamie angrily pinches at his waist. If anyone sees her wearing a gas mask when she goes out, they would spit her to death.
	"They can't see it." Dan pinches her pink face and wraps her in her arms with his coat, which makes her invisible.
	"..." Jamie is speechless, thinking that if Dan goes on stage, he might have the special ability to "take the audience as pumpkins”.
	Soon it will be the final show. Their pressure is so great, and it has to be even more stunning than the previous two so it can get a positive effect.
	By this point, Jamie has picked herself up and looks at the fading lights on the stage.
	Although she designs the clothes, and she has seen the finished products and models walking in her clothes, every time she could not help feeling excited.
	The first model comes out, and it is July Summer. As soon as she appears, the atmosphere is ignited!
	Pieces of white feathers begin to fall above, which through the overhead light shining, will reflect the beautiful snowflake patterns.
	July Summer is wearing a black-and-white short skirt with a pure white down jacket and a huge snowflake decoration on her back, which is as charming as the Queen of Snow.
	These clothes will be placed in CR's specialty stores after the show. Because they are designed by different designers, the number of clothes will be produced according to the designer's well-known ability.
	So far, Jamie is the only one who can be compared with CR's design team, and the design of clothing will only have one or several sets, commonly known as limited.
	But after this show, the clothes will be displayed on the stage for guests to compete for the highest price.
	"Bruce's idea is really good, but how much can I get?" Jamie's eyes sparkle, as if she sees a lot of bills flying towards her.
	"All I have is yours. Don't care of that little money." When he hears his wife praising another man, Dan snorts gently and glances in Bruce's direction.
	Bruce suddenly sneezes and then rubs his nose.
	Jamie giggles and says, "If you deserve to have it, just take it, and don’t forget mine."
	Dan stares helplessly at the tiny figure in his arms, and his eyes rest on her smooth white neck.
	The heat is so strong inside that as soon as she enters, she takes off her scarf and shows her shapely neck.
	"Where is the necklace?" He stretches out his hand and pushes her collar away, then asks.
	“What?” Then she remembers that he is talking about the necklace called "the world". "It's too cold. Once it gets away from me, it will become very cold, so I take it off and put it in my pocket."
	Dan stares at her, but does not speak.
	Jamie shrinks back, then pulls the necklace from the pocket of her down jacket and says, "I was wrong. I promise I won't take it off again."
	Speaking of this necklace, it is really puzzling...
	She remembers she just told him implicitly that the world is so big that she wants to see it.
	As a result, he gives a necklace to her and says it is called "the world."...
	She puts her hands back to the back of her neck to put on the necklace, but in the end, she not only fails to fasten it, but also gets caught in her hair.
	Dan looks at Jamie's aching face and shakes his head helplessly. Then he pulls the hair from behind her shoulders to the front, unties it, and with a gentle touch, he buckles the necklace on.
	He bends over slightly, his face presses against hers, and puts the exposed necklace in her clothes.
	"Remember, never take this necklace off at any time." He whispers. His low voice is very charming.
	Jamie nods, not quite understand what he is saying, but takes his words in her heart.
	Dan hooks his lips and kisses her on the cheek. "Good girl."
	Jamie really wants to cover her face, but her hands are caught by him, so she has to lower her head to hide the blush on her face.
	In the third auction, there are fifteen sets of clothes designed by Jamie, and the auction starts.
	The first one, the one that July Summer just wore on the catwalk, has a starting price of 400,000, which is higher than the previous clothes, and the fifteen sets range from 200,000 to 400,000 dollars.
	However, all the people present are rich, so they can afford it.
	At that moment, a voice interrupts the auction.
	"I have objections!" A male voice sounds, and it is an acquaintance of Dan and Jamie. "I don't think these clothes are worth the price. Is your company deliberately raising the price to deceive consumers?"
	It's Jason.
	Jamie twitches her mouth. Last time Dan has beat him, now he doesn’t learn lessons and comes to cause trouble.
	There are also some doubts among the people present. The bidding prices of clothes of the first and second auctions are between 100,000 and 200,000 dollars, but in the third one, the third auction has increased so much. However, CR doesn't seem to do such a thing as deliberately increasing the price.
Chapter 337: Miss R
	Over the years, there have been bids occasionally, but every time the price is fair. They will not deliberately raise the price.
	"The designer of these clothes is just a woman who is new to CR. However, she is the wife of CR President, so we don't know if the prices of these clothes are deliberately raised by CR President in order to cater to his wife." Jason stands up and shouts, pointing to the costumes on the stage.
	What he says makes people who were originally firm doubtful.
	The designer of these clothes turns out to be the wife of CR President. The report a few days ago was a sensation in Country C, and almost everyone knows it.
	The clothes designed by an unknown designer actually start at 400,000 dollars. Is there really an inside story?
	"CR must give us an explanation. Are you deceiving us?" Jason says again. He is very excited, as if there were such a thing.
	There are not many people echoing with him, only a small number of people talking quietly.
	In fact, most people despise Jason. Even if CR deliberately increases the price, who can't afford it?
	It is not a big deal to lose face for only hundreds of thousands of dollars. But only a fool would be so out-of-mind that goes against the boss of CR.
	"Dan, what if someone despises your wife?" Jamie pouts her mouth, looks like she is in a bad mood, but the light reflected from her watery eyes is sly.
	Dan looks gloomy, and says with displeasure. "Destroy him."
	When Jamie is about to ask how, Dan's cell phone rings. It is Hebe from the design team asking for his instructions.
	"Take the evidence and show them the true value of these clothes." Dan says in a calm voice and hangs up the phone.
	"What evidence?" Jamie looks at him puzzledly and asks.
	It sounds a little scary.
	Dan gently hooks his thin lips and turns her to face the stage. "To clear your name, of course. My wife deserves it."
	Jamie looks at the stage. At this time, Hebe and her partner step onto the stage, hands something to the auctioneer on the stage, and then turns to face the guests under the stage.
	Most of the people present have studied fashion deeply, and nearly 90% of them know the people in CR design team, but there is no one present who doesn't know Hebe.
	She is a genius in the fashion industry and she is insightful and has vision. People both inside and outside the circle would address her as a "teacher".
	Her words are authoritative. Although she seldom designs clothes now, there are still many people who want to make an appointment with her.
	"Hello everyone, I am Hebe, let’s cut to the chase." Hebe is dressed in a purple dress, with a scarf loosely tied around her neck into a knot. Full of fashionable temperament, it is easy for her to convince people.
	When people in the audience see her, they all hold their breath for fear of disturbing her.
	"Some people question our designers and insult our company, so I want to show you something." Hebe makes a gesture to his partner behind her, indicating that he could start.
	Jason immediately becomes a thorn in the side of these people, and those contemptuous eyes make him feel like sitting on pins and needles.
	Hebe lowers a huge screen behind her, and her partner turns on the projector. Then a wonderful scene happens.
	It's a fashion show of Jamie's works since she is in FS.
	Jamie lifts her forehead, and she knew that Hebe's words alone are not proof of her ability. The only evidence of her ability is her previous works at FS.
	Her works when she was Miss R.
	"Everyone must be familiar with this person. She is a talented designer who debuted in recent years and has the same reputation as me, Miss R." Hebe's voice rings again. She points to a photo enlarged on the screen and says again, "You must be very familiar with this person."
	Above, there is a photo of Jamie standing in front of Big Ben in London dressed in a casual black and white skirt. She wears a high ponytail and holds her hands in a circle against the Big Ben.
	Through the screen, you can feel her youthful beauty.
	"Isn’t this a photo of the wife of CR President? Miss Hebe, did you mean hat..." People in the audience are not fools. From the date and background of the photos, combined with the reports of a few days ago, they can guess who is she.
	Miss R and Jamie are actually one person!
	At that time, many people compared Hebe with Miss R!
	Both of them are geniuses in the fashion industry. Although Miss R made her debut a little later, her talent is not less than Hebe.
	Miss R's clothes have many fans all over the world.
	CR owns an exclusive shop, where a series of clothes designed by Miss R are displayed. Many women in the C country are envious of these dresses, but CR has never announced the sale, and that has broken the hearts of many women.
	It's been two years since the series of clothes are displayed, but people are still enthusiastic about it, which can show how popular Miss R's clothes are.
	"As you guessed, Miss R is the top designer of our company and the wife of the president, Miss Jamie." Hebe's words undoubtedly confirm the voices of those people.
	Her words are more powerful than anyone's explanation, and with the works of Jamie now available, no one doubts the prices of the clothes or the competence of the designer.
	All of a sudden people's enthusiasm rises, all eyes are focused on the stage, and covet these clothes displayed.
	Harriet, isn't this Jamie who designed you wedding dress when you got engaged? I really envy you. It's amazing to engage her wedding dress!" whispers one of the ladies sitting next to Harriet and Jason, looking envious.
	"It's so great. If you can wear the wedding dress designed by Miss R, then you won’t feel any regrets."
	Harriet laughs dryly, her face a little stiff, and she does not reply to the lady's admiration.
	She doesn’t feel regretful for her engagement, and she does for her wedding.
	Moreover, since Jason goes against with CR, CR has completely blacklisted them and terminates their cooperation. CR even stops the cooperation with the Frank and Chris families.
	Because of this, they compensate for the high penalty. It can see how decisive CR is.
	Jason is angry today, so he would provoke CR, but he didn't think it would backfire and he would’ve been slapped by the truth.
	It is really like going for wool and coming home shorn. Harriet can't laugh at the moment even if she's careless and inattentive.
Chapter 338: A Bolt from the Blue
	Since he has reached his goal, Dan takes out his phone, types a line on it and sends it to Hebe's partner on stage.
	After seeing the message, Hebe's partner immediately tells Hebe, and Hebe looks in Dan’s direction, then she retracts her eyes, clears her throat, and says something that would shock everyone.
	"Mr. Dan just decided that the remaining series will not be auctioned, and they will be placed in the specialty store for sale as limited editions. However, if you want to buy it, it must be approved by Mr. Dan or Miss Jamie."
	What?!
	This is undoubtedly a bolt from the blue for those who are ready to pay for it.
	They won't auction the clothes?
	They probably won't be able to buy these clothes after the auction!
	Jamie and Dan leave quietly when everyone is agitated, regardless of their roar and dissatisfaction.
	"Are you doing this for advertising?" Jamie turns her head to look at Dan, who is calm, and asks cheerfully.
	"Yes." Dan nods slightly and then drives away.
	"Oh." says Jamie and sighs. When she was about to count the money, she sees his instructions to Hebe, which almost freaks her out.
	But his action would make her clothes more valuable.
	In Country C, there is no shortage of rich men who have no place to spend their money. More importantly, it is a symbol of wealth. Those women who always like to keep up with the Joneses will spare no effort to bid for the dresses.
	Although she doesn't like her work to be materialized, she can't help it. She's a little miser. She can agree anything when she has money.
	Bunny is now in the old house where he first met Night.1 and others, watching the message from Night.1 on the big screen.
	It's about Hooson.
	Bunny has always been concerned about this person who he can’t get identity background and basic information. He has to be alert to it.
	While Jamie and Dan are away at work today, he asks Night. 7 to help him get out of school and come over to the old house to check the information.
	"Night.1 said Hooson is recuperating on Saipan Island. Nothing has happened for the time being." Night.7 holds a laptop in her arms, tapping on the screen and the photos on the screen enlarged.
	On the screen, Hooson is lying on the couch, wearing sunglasses on his face and basking in the sunshine in the courtyard.
	There really seems to be nothing unusual.
	Bunny stares at the screen for a moment, then asks, "Where's his sister?"
	Night.7 presses a key on the notebook, and then the screen shifts to another scene. Anna is lying on the sofa in her room and wearing a mask.
	Her hands are still tied with bandages, and her movements are very slow.
	Anna’s hands were hamstrung by Dan. Fortunately, it is timely cured, but it still takes a few years to recover.
	"She still wears a mask when her hands are broken. Night. 7, do women love beauty so much?" Bunny looks at Night.7, and asks curiously. He thinks there is something strange about it, but he couldn't tell what it is.
	Night.7 smiles, "Bunny, not every woman is as beautiful as me and your mommy, otherwise she will not wear face mask to keep beauty. Do you think so?"
	This bunny quiet agrees with Night.7's words and nods his head vigorously. His mommy is the prettiest.
	"Keep staring at it, I always feel something strange." Bunny stares at the screen, thinking with eyes wide open in bewilderment.
	"Yes." Night.7 replies, "But little master, don't you forgive Night.1?"
	Night. 1 always tries to get Bunny's forgiveness, but bunny has either ignored or fooled him. Now Bunny even sends him to the Saipan Island to keep an eye on Hooson and Anna.
	It’s been a long time, even if he did something wrong, Bunny could forgive him now.
	Bunny's little face tightens up in an instant and doesn't answer Night.7.
	He doesn’t question Night.1's ability, he couldn't put up with it that Night.1 didn’t save his mother. No one is more important than his mommy and daddy.
	Night.7 sighs helplessly. "All five of us are born to protect the masters of Myth ring, especially Night.1, who has led us to survive all these years
	"He is loyal to the Gilbert family and does his duty to the little master. You can't just deny his ability; otherwise, it will make him sad."
	Bunny bites his lips and looks at Night.7 with big bright eyes. "I know, that's why I sent him to Saipan Island."
	Night.7 is a little surprised. So, will bunny give Night. 1 a chance to make up for his mistake?
	After thinking it over, Night.7 smiles heartily. They didn't go with the wrong person.
	On the second day of the fashion show, Jamie, who is completely unaware that the outside world is already crazy, is sleeping soundly in bed with an eye mask.
	Dan gives her a week's leave. She can skip the office for the next week and have a good rest.
	Bunny is also sleeping soundly. It's Friday today. Jamie's free, so Ian skips the kindergarten and they can sleep until noon.
	But it is already noon, and both mother and son are still asleep.
	There are two important guests coming to the manor. Cindy immediately knocks on Jamie's door.
	"What? Well, I'll go down immediately after washing." Jamie jumps out of bed when she heard that Dan’s parents have come here, and she rubs her messy hair.
	"Quickly." Then Cindy goes downstairs to entertain Mrs. William.
	Jamie runs into the locker room to pick out clothes, but then she realizes that there are so many clothes in her closet that she wants to pass out. She finally picks up a slim aqua blue dress and hurries to the bathroom.
	In about fifteen minutes, she hurries out, combing her hair as she walks, and tossing the comb on the table, and then leaves the room.
	She feels that she has made them waited for her for a long time, and why did Mr. William and Mrs. William come here to see her? Aren’t they just to see Ian?
	As soon as Jamie is about to come down the stairs, she turns a corner and walks up to Bunny's room.
	Bunny has woken up and is brushing teeth.
	Jamie is instantly amused, and then pretends to scold him, "Did you see any child sleeping in? Mummy has waited for you so long, but you are not ready. Hurry up and go downstairs with Mummy."
	Bunny pauses for a moment, then rolls his eyes at Jamie and continues to brush his teeth. It is his mommy who asked him to have a good rest last night, but now she blames him for sleeping in. A kid also has the right to sleep in, OK?
Chapter 339: It’s Fine for Kids to Sleep in
	Although it isn’t clear what Jamie wants to do, Bunny quickly washes up and changes out of his pajamas before going down with Jamie.
	True enough, when they go down to the living room, they see Mr. and Madam Moore who are impatient from the waiting. She quickly greets them politely.
	“Uncle, Auntie, I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting. Bunny slept in and just woke up.”
	Bunny turns and looks at his mom, he snorts and thinks, that cunning mother, to think that she uses him as a shield.
	Once Mr. and Madam Moore see Bunny, all their frustrations vanish. They quickly wave their hands while saying, “No no, no worries, it’s good for kids to sleep in.”
	“Bunny, come to granny.” Madam Moore looks so happy. She waves at bunny lovingly in anticipation.
	Even the usual stern and serious Mr. Moore turns gentle and smiles while looking at Bunny.
	“Go and greet Grandpa and Grandma.” Jamie gently pats Bunny’s shoulder and says softly.
	She knows that Bunny has become distant to his grandma because of her but they are still his grandparents. She should not allow their relationships to be adversely affected.
	Bunny listens to Jamie and his apprehension disappears. He walks to his grandparents and says adorably, “Grandpa, grandma, how are you today?”
	Mr. and Madam Moore’s hearts warm up with his greeting and are so happy that they smile from ear to ear.
	“We’re fine, Bunny’s such a good boy. This is a gift from grandpa.” Mr. Moore takes out an intricate present which was personally chosen by him at the store.
	“Grandma also has a gift for Bunny.” Madam Moore looks by her side and finds the package and gives it to Bunny.
	Bunny looks at the two gifts and appears troubled. He turns to look at Jamie for her opinion.
	Jamie smiles and nods.
	Bunny then readily accepts grandpa and grandma’s presents.
	When Mr. Moore sees the distance between Bunny and them, he knows that it has been a while since they interacted. So, it was natural that he is apprehensive when they visit so suddenly.
	“Jamie, come and sit down.” Mr. Moore points towards the sofa and directs Jamie to sit.
	“Okay, Uncle.” Jamie nods and laughs and proceeds to sit down.
	Madam Moore pulls Bunny towards her and inspects him and says in surprise, “See, didn’t I say that he looks so familiar. He looks identical to Dan when he was a kid!”
	“Grandma is very smart! Bunny will look like mom and dad and become a very handsome man!” Bunny says proudly and smiles with his eyes close and in his chubby soft cheeks.
	Mr. and Madam Moore listens and pauses for a second, then could not resist and laugh out loud. They pat Bunny’s head and praise him.
	What … looks like mommy and daddy and become a very handsome young man?
	Jamie smiles while thinking of lovingly spanking her cheeky son.
	“Honey, don’t forget that your nose looks like mom. If you look like mommy, you’ll become a very handsome man.” Jamie says proudly.
	“Who says so, Bunny’s eyes look exactly like Dan’s. He must look like Dan to be a handsome man.” Madam Moore says immediately objecting to what Jamie just said.
	Jamie hooks her smile, and says pleasantly, “But Bunny’s facial shape resembles me, so he still resembles me the most.”
	“Everyone can see that Bunny looks the most like daddy.”
	“Looks like me!”
	“Like Dan!”
	“Like me!”
	“Like Dan!”
	Both of them didn’t want to lose out and place Bunny in the center of the conflict.
	Mr. Moore couldn’t resist any further and didn’t think it is appropriate to do this in the presence of the servants. He says, “Stop this bickering. Without Jamie, we wouldn’t be able to have a grandson who looks so much like Dan. Be content with it.”
	These words are exactly what are in Madam Moore’s mind. She knows fully well how painful it is for a woman to bear a child. And when Jamie gave birth to Bunny, she was all alone.
	When she hears Mr. Moore’s words, Jamie and Madam Moore exchange looks and laughs.
	This laughter clears all the misunderstandings and unhappiness of the past.
	Madam Moore stands up and walks to Jamie and sits beside her. She then holds her hand and with a touch of regret and says apologetically, “I was once unhappy with you because you hurt Dan. I did a lot of things that I shouldn’t have and I misunderstood you. I almost pushed Dan to other women and as a result, hurt you. Jamie, I wish that you can forgive me.”
	Jamie’s smile didn’t change but her eyes turn watery, as a mother herself, she can fully appreciate Madam Moore’s feelings. Even if there were misgivings towards her, she didn’t bear any grudges towards Madam Moore.
	If it happens to be Bunny and some other woman was to hurt her son, she may do something even worse off than what Madam Moore did to her.
	“Mom, I know, I don’t begrudge you.” Jamie laughs. It seems like the sky clears after a thunderstorm, she looks at Madam Moore with tears in her eyes and warmth in her heart.
	She feels that Mother Moore who loves her is finally back.
	“Those were done by my rascal son, we know all about it, don’t worry. In the future, we both will back you up. You must let us know immediately if he mistreats you.” Mr. Moore is so relieved to see that his daughter-in-law has made up with his wife. He feels that a huge boulder is being taken off his shoulders.
	“Thanks Dad.” Jamie says sweetly and she is extremely happy.
	But, what touches her most is the mending of the relationship between her and her mother-in-law. In this case, the age-old tension and rivalry between mother and daughter-in-law will be resolved.
	“And me, if daddy bullies mommy, I’ll be the first to dash over.” Bunny says seriously.
	When Madam Moore sees the way Bunny says it, she happily walks over, sits beside him, and asks, “Then does Bunny like daddy or mommy more?”
	This time Bunny answers without any hesitation, “Like mommy the most!”
	Daddy’s not around anyway and won’t be able to spank his backside.
	“What did you say?” a deep voice comes over threateningly.
	Bunny feels a chill running down his spine and his bum starting to ache. He immediately replies, “I love daddy the most! The most handsome daddy is the idol in my eyes!”
	“Hey!” Jamie couldn’t endure any further. The speed at which Bunny changes his words is so adorable and funny!
	Mr. and Madam Moore also laugh while looking at Bunny’s adorable eyes.
	Dan walks over and stretches out his hand to rub Bunny’s head firmly, he irresistibly laughs, “Little rascal, don’t you think that I heard?”
	Bunny smiles awkwardly and frowns while looking as cute as he can at Dan.
Chapter 340: Bullying Jamie Again?
	Bunny’s manner immediately catches the attention of the grandparents. Madam Moore is afraid that Dan will spank Bunny and snatches him over, “Dan, you need to control your temper, you shouldn’t use force on kids.”
	Dan is speechless, if the servant didn’t call him to inform him that his parents are at his house, he will not know that they are there. He had told them that Jamie is free tomorrow and will take her and Bunny to visit them tomorrow.
	Who knows that they are unable to wait and come over today.
	“Why are you here today?” Dan takes off his thin jacket, hands it to the servant, and sits beside Jamie.
	Mr. Moore looks at Dan in discontent, “If we don’t come over, when are you going to let us see Bunny?”
	“Tomorrow.” Dan answers while looking at them with the expression that they didn’t mean what they say.
	“Mom and dad are most welcome to come over whenever you want to see Bunny.” Jamie reaches out and pulls Dan’s clothes while glaring at him.
	Dan hears her calling his parents mom and dad and immediately turns and looks at her tenderly.
	He lowers his head and says softly into her ears, “They didn’t bully you?”
	This man is so calculative. Jamie wanted to give him a good beating.
	“No, they are treating me very well. They even said that they’ll support me if you ever mistreat me.” Jamie laughs happily.
	Dan huffs softly and turns his head slightly, the view is obscured by Jamie’s hair and he gently nibbles her earlobe and says, “What if I bully you this way?”
	Jamie’s body trembles and she immediately straightens her clothes, bites down on her lower lips and blushes immediately.
	“Dan, are you bullying Jamie?” She hears Bunny telling her softly and immediately demands.
	Dan sits up straight and looks innocently at Madam Moore.
	“The kid is around, behave yourself, don’t think that we don’t know that you just bullied Jamie.” Madam Moore lectures Dan sternly.
	Dan purses his lips and nods helplessly.
	Jamie finds his defeated looks amusing and what Madam Moore says about him bullying her is so heartwarming.
	Dan turns and looks at her, shrugs his shoulders with the meaning that he does not have any speaking rights in front of his parents.
	“Sir, Madam, lunch is ready.” The servant walks over and says.
	“Let’s go, Bunny, grandma feed you, alright?” Madam Moore carries Bunny, stands up, and walks to the dining room.
	“But Bunny knows how to eat by myself. But if grandma wants, then Bunny will accept.” Bunny frowns and thereafter sweetly accepts.
	“Bunny is such a good boy!” Madam Moore laughs and pinches Bunny’s cheek.
	After lunch with Mr. and Madam Moore, they take Bunny out and tonight Bunny will spend the night at their place.
	Mr. and Madam Moore love Bunny and want to give the best to him. That’s why Jamie isn’t worried at all. She goes back to her room to take a nap after lunch and Dan goes back to the office.
	But after lying down for no more than ten minutes, the cell phone begins to ring. Jamie had programmed her phone not to accept any calls from unknown numbers from then till five in the afternoon. Only those in her contacts will get through to her.
	That’s why she immediately accepts the call when it rings.
	“You’re finally together with your prince, is that exciting? Hey, I’m trying to sleep.” Jamie uses her hand to block her eyes and says in a soft and muffled voice.
	“Sleep? Do you know what time it is? My engagement with Eddie was ruined. Now both parents intend to make it up. This time it should be the actual marriage.” Though Wendy’s voice was hurried, it was sweet. Looks like they had made up.
	“And so? Get to the point!” Jamie interrupts her in frustration. Someone who wants to sleep can be easily agitated.
	Wendy remembers the actual reason she calls Jamie. She speaks softly to Jamie, “You are aware, our family and the Fields family are partners. In recent years, Duke’s father seems to be ready to hand over the family business to Duke. So, my father invited them over and they should be arriving soon.”
	The fields!
	Jamie immediately sits up on the bed and anxiously asks, “Thereafter?”
	“What’s worse is my father wants me to entertain him and I’m afraid that if Eddie finds out, he’ll misunderstand, so…”
	“So, you want me to go over to accompany you, right?” Jamie is gnashing her teeth as she speaks.
	…
	Base on limited memories, Jamie finally finds the Wales residence. She only came a few times but she has a deep impression of the location.
	The deep impression is due to Mr. and Madam Wales.
	Mr. and Madam Wales are not the typical rich family who are strict and indulgent to their only daughter. They are very pragmatic and will not force Wendy to do what she doesn’t like. That’s why from young, Wendy has been very outgoing and optimistic.
	Since she is the only daughter, the family business will eventually go to Wendy’s husband. Jamie feels that Mr. and Madam Wales are much better at picking a man for Wendy.
	Do they prefer trash?
	When the marriage between the Fields and Swifts were canceled, the Fields are very anxious to get a good wife for Duke and yet want someone who matches him in terms of status and wealth.
	At A city, someone of status and wealth and age, the only suitable candidate is Wendy.
	Perhaps this is the intention of the Fields when they want to join up with the Wales in marriage.
	“Are you as slow as the turtle?” Wendy runs over to Jamie as soon as she sees her. “He is already here and they are in the living room.”
	“Wendy, you must be mentally prepared, I’m afraid the Fields are here for your juicy flesh.” Jamie sighs softly.
	It’s so difficult to be blissful in marriage.
	Wendy is unafraid, she feels that she is the strongest warrior. She pulls her hand and walks towards the villa, “How can that be, I’ll soon be engaged with Eddie. You’re overthinking this.”
	Jamie rolls her eyes and keeps quiet. She doesn’t know why but she has a bad feeling about this.
	Is she overthinking this?
	When they enter the living room, Jamie sees Mr. and Madam Wales sitting across from Duke Field. He is in a black suit with a tie and speaks politely with Mr. and Madam Wales, very different from his usual self.
	But Jamie feels that black color doesn’t suit Duke. Grey looks more of his color to suit his personality.
Chapter 341: Cold and Trashy Personality
	Cold and trashy personality
	Jamie and Wendy exchange looks and immediately understands the other, they smiled sinisterly.
	“Dad, mom, this is Jamie. Do you still remember her? We wore the same trousers.” Wendy pulls Jamie to the sofa next to her parents, a distance from Duke.
	Who wore a pair of trousers with you? Jamie spits out a clot while smiling and politely greets, “Uncle and Auntie, how do you do. It has been a long time since we last met. Somehow you look even younger than before!”
	Mr. and Madam Wales love to be praised for looking young, particularly Madam Wales.
	“Of course I remember, this is Jamie, wow, how you’ve grown and your mouth has become sweeter.” Madam Wales replies with a smile while seeing Jamie nodding.
	“How can we forget Wendy’s good friend? Jamie, treat this as your home and don’t stand on ceremony.” Mr. Wales says and gets the servant to serve them a glass of juice.
	Duke casually looks at Jamie and Wendy, without any changes to his mood.
	“Ms. Wales, Missus, how do you do.” Duke gently nods and politely greets Wendy and Jamie.
	Jamie finds it amusing. She is younger than Duke and for him to address her as Missus, is rather interesting.
	“Good day, Mr. Field.” Wendy simply replies Duke’s greeting. Now when she sees Duke, she doesn’t get excited but is calm as a pool of dead water.
	“Wendy, Jamie and Duke were from the same high school, weren’t you? You knew each other well, don’t you?” Madam Wales says as she remembers, without any motives.
	Jamie and Wendy are taken aback with surprise! Can it be that Madam Wales detects something?
	“That was so long ago, mom, I’ve long forgotten about it.” Wendy sticks out her tongue at her mother, acting spoiled.
	Madam Wales pushes her forehead with her finger, seemingly despising her for not behaving like a lady.
	“Don’t forget, previously you took a stab for…”
	“Mom, you are talking too much today.” Wendy worries that her mother will bring up the incident in which she took a stab for Duke and cause unnecessary misunderstandings. She quickly interrupts her mother.
	Madam Wales looks at Wendy, “This child, how dare you interrupt your mother in front of so many people?”
	The bantering between mother and daughter makes Jamie think of her mother. They used to do this too. But that can never happen again, she isn’t as fortunate as Wendy.
	“This is not bad. If it goes on smoothly, in the coming year our profits will increase by approximately 30%.” Mr. Wales looks at the document brought by Duke and praises him.
	“If there aren’t any problems, please sign on the document.” Duke smiles and takes a sip from the cup of tea.
	Mr. Wales nods and practically agrees but he doesn’t have a pen with him, he looks around, “Where’s the pen?”
	“I have one.” Duke places the cup down and reaches into his suit for a pen. The pen accidentally hooks onto a necklace and drags it out which drops on to the table.
	Mr. Wales wipes his glasses, he picks up the necklace and inspects it in detail.
	“It’s only a small thing.” Painful memories flash before Duke’s eyes but he pretends not to be affected.
	Jamie and Wendy were talking to each other and did not notice what was happening here.
	“Isn’t this Wendy’s precious Star of the sea necklace? Why is it with you?” Madam Wales says faster than Mr. Wales when she sees the necklace.
	Duke is surprised to see the expression on Mr. and Madam Wales. It is as if they had just seen a long lost precious treasure.
	“Uncle and Auntie, you’ve seen this necklace?” He asks softly with curiosity.
	Joey once told him that the Star of the Sea was given to her by her mother as a birthday present. She never shows it to anyone. Then why has Mr. and Mrs. Wales seen it? And they appear to be so familiar with it?
	The answer is about to be revealed.
	“There was this birthday of Wendy and we wanted to give her a present. This child wants a totally one of a kind gift.” Madam Wales takes the Star of the Sea necklace from Mr. Wales and reminisces.
	“Yes, there was only one Star of the Sea, even the pattern on it was designed by my wife and I. Furthermore, you can see in the middle, there is a grain of rice with Wendy’s name.”
	As Mr. Wales says, he lifts the Star of the Sea towards the light and puts it in front of Duke for him to take a look.
	Duke looks at the Star of the Sea. From the reflection of the ray of light, he can see the unique snowflake pattern, and, in the middle, there is a little grain of rice. On it, there is a name, Wendy.
	This explains it all. This Star of the Sea was a present given by the Wales to Wendy and was not from Joey’s mother to her!
	Then Joey…
	Duke suddenly stands up and says to Mr. and Mrs. Wales “Sorry, I have to take my leave” and walks briskly to the door.
	The Wales didn’t bother with Duke and shows the Star of the Sea to Wendy.
	Wendy stares at the Star of the Sea with her wide-open eyes. Isn’t the Star of the Sea with Duke and returned to Joey as an engagement present? How did it end up in her parent’s hands?
	Jamie is also in shock while looking at the Star of the Sea in the Wales’ hands. She turns and looks towards where Duke was sitting and realizes that Duke had left without them knowing.
	Wrapped within the Star of the Sea are the secrets of Wendy saving Duke; Eddie saving Wendy but Duke had mistaken her identity and Wendy almost losing Eddie. This is the one item that will unravel all the misunderstandings and secrets.
	Wendy does not owe Duke and it is Duke who owes her. Eddie does not owe Wendy but it is Wendy who owes him a lot, a lot.
	If the secret is resolved, the person who will suffer the most will be Duke. Wendy and Eddie would be the victor with all the bliss.
	Jamie sighs and she worries what would Duke do if he realizes his mistake.
	“You child, didn’t you say that it was lost? How come it is with Duke?” Madam Wales flicked Wendy’s forehead and gently gives the Star of the Sea to Wendy, “This time take good care of it.”
	Wendy is speechless, “Mom, it was really lost. If I had given it to anyone, why did I cry for that long?”
	“It doesn’t appear that Duke knew that the Star of the Sea belongs to Wendy and how could Wendy give something like this to him?” It was Mr. Gale who is logical and clear in his thoughts.
	“Still it’s father who is the most intelligent.” Wendy says to her mother and walks over to hug her father’s arm.
	Jamie shakes her head and looks out the window with apprehension.
Chapter 342: The Cracks Deepen
	…
	Duke goes to the courtyard and gives a call to Joey. He has to get the facts of this matter.
	Who was the one who took a stab for him!
	Joey quickly answers the call and for her to compose herself, she pinches down hard on her thigh, “Duke, you finally called…”
	Duke takes a while to calm himself down and says, “Joey, you once said that the Star of the Sea was given to you by your mother, correct?”
	Joey’s heart skips a beat and suppresses her guilt and replies, “Yes, yes, why?”
	“I just found out that on the Star of the Sea, there is a tree ring pattern. Did your mother engrave this to make it more unique?” His voice is cold and concealing his accusations and cannot be detected by the listener.
	“Yes, my mother loves me very much.” Joey sighs a breath of relief, thinking that he has discovered. But why hasn’t she heard of Wendy ever mention that there was a pattern of any kind?
	Duke raises the corner of his mouth, “Really? I even found a grain of rice with your name engraved on it. Your mother really loves you!”
	“Of course my mother loves me, that’s why she prepared such a gift for me… Hello? Duke? Are you listening?”
	Joey is still talking when the line is cut. And Duke’s phone is in pieces.
	…
	The lost and found of the Star of the Sea has adversely affected Wendy. She will never put it on ever again. Duke had it on him every day and even used it to propose to Joey. She detests it now.
	Mr. and Mrs. Wales also did not force her to put it on, thinking that it has been missing for so long and she has lost any attachment towards it. In any case, there are so many beautiful precious stones on earth and they’ll just have another one made especially for her.
	“Didn’t you miss your Star of the Sea? Why don’t you want it now?” Jamie picks up the glass of juice for a sip. This is absolutely one of a kind on earth, it will be amazing if it can be suitably paired with an evening gown. But it had been on Duke for so long and it’s understandable for Wendy to detest it now.
	Wendy is about to answer when she sees Duke entering the living room. He walks directly towards her and grasps her hand and pulls her out.
	Mr. and Mrs. Wales look at Jamie, thinking that she knows what is happening.
	Jamie apologizes and laughs, “I’ll go and take a look.” She places down the glass and walks out.
	Duke forcibly drags Wendy out of the villa and she has no chance of breaking free. Though Wendy knows some Judo, it won’t work on Duke.
	“Duke, what do you want?” Wendy is getting upset.
	Duke acts as if he didn’t hear her and pulls her towards the car park. He opens the car door and pushes her into it and closes the door. He sits in the driver seat, turns on the engine, and left the Wales residence.
	“What the fuck, is this kidnapping?” Jamie quickly gets into her car and follows behind.
	To prevent Duke from doing anything to Wendy, Jamie feels that she should call someone over.
	It’s most suitable to call Eddie, after all, he is Wendy’s fiancé.
	Jamie calls Eddie as she follows Duke’s car.
	Duke’s car is moving very quickly along the road. It’s a good thing that the traffic is light at this time of the day and Jamie can stay on his tail.
	After about ten plus minutes, Duke turns into a business street and Jamie follows closely.
	The place where he comes to is the place where Wendy took a stab for him.
	Jamie looks at the small entrance to the alley and the memories flood back. To think that a fight would change the lives of three people.
	Duke’s cold expression softens as he looks at the place. Wendy gets out of the car and pats her chest, relieved that Duke did not dump her body in the wilderness after finding out.
	But this place… She turns and looks and feels that it is very familiar.
	Oh right, it was here that she took a stab for Duke.
	Why did he bring her here?
	“That time, the person who took a stab for me, was that you?” Duke turns and asks Wendy.
	“No.” Wendy answers without any hesitation.
	If it is possible, she would rather that all these didn’t happen and perhaps they will all be very blissful and happy.
	When she was young, she would do things without thinking twice. Once she feels like it, she will act on it.
	“You are lying!” Duke grabs on tightly to Wendy’s shoulder and forces her to look in his eyes. “If The Star of the Sea is yours, then who else can it be?”
	Wendy’s expression is very calm throughout without a ripple, “It’s Joey, haven’t you been thinking that it was her?”
	Her voice is very soft but it causes Duke to frown deeply in pain. That’s right, it is exactly why he always thought it was Joey and never suspected the truth. He always thought that the Star of the Sea belongs to Joey and that’s why Joey is the person he needs to find.
	The Star of the Sea is correct but he is wrong about the owner of the necklace. He was wrong for so many years and was lied to by Joey like a fool.
	But now, the truth is, the actual owner of the Star of the Sea is Wendy, the person who he wronged and sent to the Police Station!
	Duke is clearly in pain and closes his eyes.
	When Jamie looks at this scene, her heart softens and her hate towards Duke diminishes.
	She hates Duke because he once hurt Wendy but now, what Duke had done seems to slap him across his face.
	He is the one who mistook the person’s identity. He has no one to blame except himself.
	Duke has never allowed anyone to get close to him. When something happens, he will be very calm and collected. Although he is fraught with an internal struggle, outwardly he still looks composed.
	“I’m sorry.” He says after a while.
	Wendy stares at him, she is surprised that Duke will apologize to her.
	“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have mistaken Joey for you.” Duke’s voice is full of guilt and appears to be begging Wendy for forgiveness.
	Man, once the truth comes out, he will think about all that has happened, those things that he didn’t care about, all becomes a critical wound.
	The extent to which he loved the person who took a stab for him, is how much he feels guilty now. But all these are not reasons for him to be forgiven.
	“I’m sorry that I harmed you previously.”
	“I’m sorry, Wendy.”
	This is the first time in so many years that he called Wendy’s name.
Chapter 343: I don’t Accept Your Apology
	But Wendy no longer gets excited with her heart racing for him, it is never the same, simply because she does not like him anymore.
	“I don’t accept your apologies.” Wendy softly says as she looks calmly at Duke. She is not as enthusiastic as before.
	“Since you are wrong, then continue to be wrong.”
	Duke feels chills running down his spine and trembles. He holds on to her shoulder with an expression of hurt.
	He brings Wendy into his embrace and holds onto her tightly.
	“Do you know that I have never thought that I can regret so much today.” Duke closes his eyes and says with a voice full of regret and pain.
	He realizes that he has wasted so many years.
	Jamie worries that Duke will do something to Wendy and quickly gets out of the car. She then sees Eddie coming out of another car.
	Jamie turns and looks at Duke and Wendy. She instantly bites down on her lips and realizes that things are going to get out of hand.
	Eddie’s hand was still on the car door and sees the two of them embracing. He didn’t go over and he didn’t make a sound. He just looks on quietly.
	“Ahem ahem ahem.” Jamie could not resist and clears her throat to signal to Wendy while trying desperately to get her attention.
	When she was pulled into Duke’s embrace, Wendy thought that she was imagining. But when she hears Jamie’s calls, she comes to her senses and pushes Duke away.
	She looks at Duke and says to him sternly, “If you really feel guilty and regret, then please forget about this and never appear in my life ever again.”
	She tries to walk away after she finishes but Duke holds her onto her, not allowing her to move an inch.
	“What do you think you are doing?” Wendy is angry. She already stated very clearly, what doesn’t he understand?
	“Release her, Duke.” Eddie walks to Wendy’s side and holds onto her other hand. He stares at Duke coldly and emotionlessly but with a poise saying that he will not take no for an answer.
	“Eddie…” Wendy remarks softly. Did he see that scene? Is there a misunderstanding?
	Duke refuses to release his grip, stubborn as he has been and stares back at Eddie.
	“Aren’t you clear by now that Wendy does not accept you? If you really regret it, then continue to regret it. My Wendy doesn’t need your guilt.” Eddie says with a smirk. He forcibly pulls Wendy over and wraps the other hand around her waist to support her.
	Duke’s hands tense up but after a while, he puts them down but continues to clench his fists.
	Thereafter he puts his hands into his trousers, “Your Wendy?”
	“Don’t you know that Wendy is my fiancée?” Eddie says in return with a smirk.
	Wendy blushes and leans on to Eddie and like a vulnerable little girl. Jamie looks on from the side, feeling slightly dizzy.
	“Your engagement ceremony did not complete and Wendy cannot be considered as your fiancée.”
	“Duke, enough.” Wendy couldn’t listen to it any further. Duke is just refusing to accept the reality. Even though she and Eddie haven’t gone through the engagement ceremony, the issue is as good as done. Even if she is not with Eddie, she will not like him again.
	“Even if we are not, you will not have a single chance, Duke.” Eddie is calm and says to Duke, “A sinner will not be able to return to the past even when he is forgiven.”
	His words were cruel. Jamie could see from his expression of loneliness. Not only did Duke mistake the identity of a person, so did Wendy.
	A sinner cannot return to the past even when he is forgiven.
	Eddie, you forgave Wendy’s mistake and they returned to the past. This is because you love her. You can deceive Duke but you can’t deceive yourself.
	Jamie purses her lips and gets back into the car. She starts the car without hesitation and drives away from that place. Wendy has her protector and it is pointless for her to remain there.
	It is almost six in the evening, the winter nights start particularly early and gets dark quickly.
	Jamie drives the car home and she should still be able to make it in time for dinner. She hums a tune and taps her fingers on the steering wheel waiting for the red light to turn green.
	She looks around and then fixates in a direction.
	Ryan is in the car beside hers. She wants to greet him and stops herself when she sees the person beside him. It was Jozo!
	How does Ryan know Jozo?
	Jamie looks at them and hopes to find out what is happening. The lights turn green and the cars behind her start to blare their horns. She has no choice but to drive away.
	…
	Ryan looks sullen at the road and is talking via the Bluetooth earpiece.
	At his side, Jozo maintains a slight smile and waits patiently for him to finish his call. She then asks, “How is it?”
	“As you wished.” Ryan takes off his earpiece and throws it aside in frustration.
	Jozo’s smile deepens, “Think about the person you love most. Don’t waste your efforts on a person who you cannot get.”
	Ryan did not answer and let off a chilly sensation.
	“Thereafter you just help me publicize this and you will have your chances. Are you happy? My friend?” Jozo takes out a file from her bag and says with confidence.
	Ryan looks at the file and asks, “What’s this?”
	“You don’t have to bother, just listen to me from now on.”
	“Ah, you’ve got this all reversed.” Ryan laughs coldly, not bothering about what she says. “Don’t forget that I can easily terminate our partnership. I will gladly dump a useless partner such as you.”
	Jozo looks at Ryan’s arrogance and while gnashing her teeth, she knows that she is still dependent on him and cannot antagonize him.
	“Okay, I’ll tell you…”
	…
	Jamie is as usual in the courtyard looking at comics and drawing, then in the warm room eating ice cream looking out the window in case Dan comes back and captures her in his embrace.
	It’s tantalizing to eat ice cream during winter but in consideration of her stomach, she only does so occasionally.
	“Mommy, Bunny wants to sleep with mommy tonight.” Bunny pushes open the door and dragging a rabbit as he walks in.
	Had it been last time, Jamie would immediately nod in agreement but now that she is carrying Dan’s daughter, she starts to distance away from Bunny.
Chapter 344: Shameless Boy
	"Give me a break. You are older than to sleep with mommy. You shameless boy." Jamie Moore doesn't look away from the cartoon and waves at him.
	Ian Moore's cute expression immediately disappears. He looks at Jamie Moore's ice cream and says, "Mommy！I'll tell Daddy you're eating ice cream!"
	"How dare you！” she immediately hides the ice cream with a pillow and stares at Ian Moore.
	This little boy is increasingly naughty. He threats his mother!
	Ian Moore raises his chin, and he seemingly says I am not afraid of it. Then he goes to Jamie Moore and asks her, "Mommy, it's more than nine o'clock now. Usually, daddy should have come back at this time. Does he run away with a beautiful aunt?"
	"Maybe, Mommy will call and ask." Jamie Moore looks at the time, sure enough, it's so late, but Dan William hasn't come back, and she still has ice cream in the evening?!
	Ian Moore is speechless when she looks for her mobile phone in a hurry. In this bright room, whether it's day or night, it's no wonder that mommy forgets the day or the night.
	Thinking with disgust, Ian Moore picks up Jamie Moore's the ice cream, takes a spoon and dugs a big bock into his mouth.
	Jamie Moore gives Dan William a phone call. As usual, he answers it after about five seconds. There comes Dan William's always cold voice, "I'm in the hospital. What's the matter?"
	"Hospital? Are you hurt? " As soon as she hears that he is in the hospital, Jamie Moore's heart breaks and she quickly asks. But Dan William's voice doesn't look like he was injured or ill.
	The next day, Jamie Moore sleeps less than five hours.
	The rest of the time is spent in rolling on the bed, so when she gets up to wash this morning, she doesn't see two obvious dark circles under her eyes in the mirror.
	"Mommy, do you go as a thief last night?" Ian Moore has just packs his schoolbag and is going to school. When he sees Jamie Moore coming down from upstairs, he immediately turns around and faces her. His two little paws subconsciously cover the edge of his schoolbag.
	Jamie Moore rolls her eyes at him, there is no energy to teach him, the indoor drag rubbing the ground comes, issuing a lazy sound.
	She looks around the hall, but she doesn't see Dan William. She frowns, "your father hasn't come back yet?"
	"No. Dad just called and says he would be back later today." Ian Moore steps back a few steps, a little farther from Jamie Moore.
	Jamie Moore doesn't find anything wrong with Ian Moore. Listening to him, she just nods, reaches out and rubs his neck. However, she inadvertently sees the newspaper beside Ian Moore's schoolbag he stuffed there.
	"What do you do with your newspaper when you go to school?" Jamie Moore says, looking at Ian Moore’s little face.
	Ian Moore suddenly drops a cold sweat on the back of his head. He is forced to calm down on his small face. His face is not red and his heart does not jump. He says to Jamie Moore, "because the teacher is going to make us do scissor works today …” Jamie Moore, who is in a bad mood, doesn't go to investigate Ian Moore's eccentricity and sends him to school with a smack on his face.
	Cindy Swift sets the breakfast in front of her, and then steps aside.
	Jamie Moore habitually takes out her mobile phone to brush wechat. And she refreshes and sees today's headlines.
	CR president sends Miss Mystery at night
	When she sees the first two letters, Jamie Moore's eyes stops, and curiosity prompts her to reach in and see what was going on.
	The title is "CR president sends Miss Mystery to the hospital at night. Soon after, two parents of the Li family appear together in the hospital. Is there any crisis for the young lady of the Li family?"
	Young lady? They are talking about me?
	Jamie Moore raises her eyebrows, picks up a sandwich and eats it without soul.
	She knows about it last night and knows that the woman is Jozo, but it is like she is out of favor by the media.
	Jozo is admitted to the hospital only because she had a car accident last night. It is reasonable for Dan William and his parents to visit her, so she has no complaints.
	But she still depresses all night and doesn't sleep well. It seems that she is not so generous.
	After brushing immediately, she almost finishes eating. After putting away her mobile phone, she goes to the kitchen, preparing vegetables and begins to cook soup.
	Cindy Swift is afraid that she should be busy alone, so she also comes to help her.
	—
	Central Hospital, VIP ward 305.
	Unexpectedly, Jamie Moore doesn't meet Dan William or his father and mother here. Only Jozo is here, she is preparing to take a rest.
	"Miss Moore, it's not a coincidence that Dan William has left for the company, and his uncle and aunt have just returned." When Jozo sees Jamie Moore coming, she looks at her in surprise, and then raises a soft smile to look at her.
	"I'm not here for him, I'm here for you." Jamie Moore looks at her, and then put her bottle in her hand on the table beside the bed, "I heard that you lost too much blood last night, so I make you a soup for tonifying blood. Drink it while it is hot."
	Hearing this, Jozo's eyes brightens slightly, looking at the incubator on the table and says, "Thank you."
	Jamie Moore chuckles, and then sets out the bowl of the incubator to make it easier for her. "Here you are. I'll leave if there's nothing wrong with it."
	"All right.” Jozo watches her leave until the door of the ward is closed, and the soft smile on her face gradually disappears.
	"What he said is true." She sniffs, and then looks at the soup in the bowl. Without any hesitation, she takes out a package from her pocket and pours it into the bowl.
	...
	When Jamie Moore comes to the hospital for the second time, it is only about an hour after her previous visit.
	It is said that Jozo has entered the emergency room because she drank the soup she sent this morning.
	But she and Cindy Swift have drunk the soup, and there is no problem. How could Jozo have a problem when she drunk it?
	Jamie Moore's heart is in a mess, tightly staring at the number of the floor she was hurrying to, her heart seems to be uncomfortable.
	Plink——
	The elevator finally reaches the floor, and as soon as Jamie Moore rushes out, she accidentally bumps into a man.
	"Ryan Jack? How could you be here? " Jamie Moore covers her forehead and looks at Ryan Jack, who is standing on one side of the wall. He asks in surprise.
	The smile on Ryan Jack's face is as gentle as ever, "I come to see a friend. How about you? What are you doing in such a hurry? "
	When he asks, Jamie Moore answers, "I don't have time to tell you I'm going first."
Chapter 345: What Happened to Jozo?
	"Wait a minute." Instead of leaving, Ryan Jack follows her to the emergency room.
	The man standing outside the first-aid room is Dan William.
	He changes into a black hand-made suit this morning. It is so new that there is not a single wrinkle on it. His hands falls in his trouser pockets, and his whole body exudes a light.
	He has the bright black light.
	His father and mother are waiting on the bench outside the emergency room. Compared with the anxious mother, his father is calmer.
	"Dan William, how is Jozo?" Jamie Moore runs over, panting slightly, and standing in front of Dan William, she asks quickly.
	Dan William's eyes staring at the light on the top of his head finally draws back, and his eyes falls on her. Then he looks across her and sees Ryan Jack behind her, and his eyebrows suddenly frowns.
	"How do you get together?" He narrows his black eyes, straightening his bent legs, and looks at Ryan Jack with some cool eyes.
	"We meet on the road just now, and we come together." Jamie Moore bites her lower lip, and she always feel that Dan William is a little strange.
	"Jamie Moore, what do you give Jozo to eat? How could she suddenly enter the emergency room?" When his mother sees that Jamie Moore is coming, she immediately comes forward and takes her by the hand.
	"Mom, do you mean that I gave her something bad on purpose, which made her enter the emergency room?"
	She can't believe it. Maybe there is something wrong with the food, or Jozo is allergic to something, and she just ran into it.
	But it would be very hurtful if she is suspected to have done it on purpose.
	His mother doesn't mean to. She feels a little anxious when she is asked by Jamie Moore. After all, if Jozo has an accident, she will feel guilty for a long time.
	"That's not what mom means. I know it won't happen in silence." Mother pats Jamie Moore's hand comfortingly and says to her.
	Jamie Moore droops her eyes and then laughs as if nothing has happened. "It's OK, mom. I know that."
	"You go back first. We can do it here." Dan William's eyes falls on Jamie Moore's eyes, and his eyebrows frowns anxiously.
	He can see that her spirit is not particularly good, last night is estimated to be caused by bad sleeping.
	However, his anxious words at this time are a bit of a rush for the especially sensitive Jamie Moore at the special time, causing her heart to break heart.
	"Then I'll go back first." Jamie Moore's eyes flashes dimly, and her lips shows a slightly bitter smile. After saying goodbye to his father and mother, she leaves in a hurry.
	Dan William hesitates when he looks at Jamie Moore's leaving. He is trying to catch up with her, but the light in the emergency room is dim at this time.
	Jozo is lying on the bed and is pushed out by the doctors and nurses.
	"You are angry, aren't you?" Ryan Jack, standing beside Jamie Moore, looking at the number of elevators going down and asks softly.
	Jamie Moore doesn't answer, but the aggrieved and depressed expression on her face is enough to explain it.
	"You are all the same. When you are not happy, you like to keep it in your heart. You are worried about a lot of people." Ryan Jack looks at Jamie Moore's reflection reflected from the elevator mirror. His eyes are attached and his smile is tender.
	In fact, he wants to say that when she is in a bad mood, he was lucky to be around her.
	"I'm ok. I just can't think of it. Don't worry about me." Jamie Moore smiles at him and says she's OK. Then he lowers her head and goes on thinking.
	In the soup she cooks today, what in the end may cause Jozo allergy?
	After that, there is just silence in the elevator.
	When the elevator reaches the first floor that Ryan Jack says, "Jamie, try not to be alone these days."
	With this endless remark, the elevator door opens and he steps out.
	However, Jamie Moore's face is obviously puzzled. She doesn’t understand what he had just said
	She walks out of the elevator and leaves the hospital with a heavy heart.
	"There she is." A man in black, most of his face blocks by an upright collar, holding a camera and takes a few pictures of Jamie Moore's back.
	"Be careful not to be found." Another man pulls him over. Fortunately, it is a remote corner, so it doesn't attract much attention.
	"We've been following for so many days. When should we start?"
	"Are you stupid? This woman has someone to protect her. If the task is not finished, she may be in a mess! "
	After returning to the manor, Jamie Moore can't wait to ask Cindy Swift to bring her the soup when she left in the morning. After loading, she inquired about the place where Dr. Slater lives, and hurries there.
	She wants to find out what the problem is and she wants to prove that she is innocent!
	With Dr. Slater's sampling investigation, the final result shows that these soup products are very normal. It is just soup.
	It seems only when Dan William comes back and asks about the specific situation.
	Jamie Moore sits in the living room watching TV, her eyes from time to time looking out of the door.as time goes by, her heart becomes colder and colder.
	Ian Moore sees that she is in a bad mood and doesn't disturb her much. After having dinner together, he goes upstairs.
	After Ian Moore goes upstairs, she sits down in front of the computer desktop, pressing on the power supply of the computer, and immediately after standby, she quickly entered the desktop.
	She learns from night 3 and night 5, who has been following Jamie Moore's side to protect her. Today, Jamie Moore goes to the hospital to deliver the soup to the woman named Jozo, but in the end, something goes wrong with the soup. She also went to Slater to verify that the soup is no problem.
	Ian Moore looks at the dazzling data on the screen. He doesn't believe that his mother would poison people in the soup. It is impossible for her to take the medicine to the hospital. Isn't that an idiot?
	Night.5 also says that when she leaves, he sees Jozo pouring a package of things into the soup, but what it is, he does not know.
	It is Jozo who puts something in. Ian Moore enters the hospital system, and then steals the medical records of Jozo to check.
	Unknown drug-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction, coupled with blood loss, leading to some internal bleeding.
	Unknown drugs?
	Ian Moore squints that pair of bright big eyes, even the hospital has not checked out the specific drug name so far, so the item of drug name is blank.
	Even the hospital does not know the things, let alone his mother! A bunch of idiots.
Chapter 346: Hang Himself with a Noodle
	“Night. 7, go to the hospital and see if you can find something.” Ian says to Night. 7 as he’s typing on the keyboard.
	“Okay.” Night. 7 responds and goes to do the work Ian told him to.
	But since it’s made by Jozo, and it’s intended to set his mom up, the possibility of the evidences that left will be small.
	Even though it’s like that, Ian is still not letting go of any clue that he can get, and still they have literally no clue at all right now, just by letting Night. 5 see this will not prove his mom’s innocence.
	But when Night. 7 sneaks into the hospital and checks, she is seen by someone who guards there already.
	Jozo has changed to intensive care unit, Night. 7 easily sneaks into the ward she’s in before, she’s investigating carefully.
	Even Jozo is careful, though Night. 7 still figures something out from a tiny detail.
	The table is spread with powder, even though the volume is not much, but as a member of the five member group, if she can’t even do this small thing right, then Night. 7 will really want to hang himself with a noodle.
	She crouches and carefully swipes the powder in a plastic bag, then carefully ties it up.
	At this moment, a quick sound is aiming her back of her head, when she is about to get hit, Night. 7 who is facing the other way just simple turns her head and easily dodges it.
	Then that thing just goes straight to the glass, *plung* that glass suddenly breaks into pieces.
	“Oh? Nice strength you have there.” Night. 7 is whistling, but then she turns around, no one is behind her.
	Even though the speed of that thing fast, but she sees it clearly, it is a coin.
	Using a coin to break a glass, imagine how much strength and accuracy that guy has.
	“Nice dodge.” Even though the door has no one there, but there’s a low voice talking to her.
	“How pussy you are to hide in the dark, I dare you to fight me, come one.” That’s what she says, but she has no interest to fight this guy at all.
	She keeps the powder safely on her and carefully looking around the ward.
	She’s the only female member in the group, and because her strength is placed on seventh, so her code name is Night. 7, she doesn’t have a name, she can’t remember it even if she does.
	But she is using the name Night. 7 all the time.
	But just because she’s a female, she’s better than man on the other aspects, and she’s more careful.
	Her hiding skills is the best except for including the people who is placing in front of her.
	But this guy caught her, so she’s kinda interested in this guy.
	As far as she knows, except for Ian’s dad’s training camp at city A, there’s no other groups can compete with them anymore, or the table has changed?
	Or there’s another underground organization?
	“You are still as frivolous as before.” That guy says, and his voice is somber, it kinda feels like hard to get if he’s male or a female, just when Night. 7 is shocked by his words, the guy says another shocking word.
	It’s her name, Night. 7.
	She’s shocked, and she carefully looks at the door, she walks towards it and walks out of the door.
	The aisle is empty, and Night. 7 has to be careful, this guy not only can silently get close to her, and he can leave in a blink of an eye, he’s not bad.
	And the main thing is, this guy knows her.
	She can assure that except for the leader of Gilberts and the ten members group, no one knows her name.
	She thinks for a while and looks at the aisle, hide herself and leaves.
	After backing to the resort, she says everything to Ian, it is much more different than the cold face she has before at the hospital, she even makes some body movement to explain her situation.
	“So that’s why I ask you guys before, are you sure the group has only five of you left?” Ian heard that and he’s not surprising, because he did assume this before, and he asks Night. 1 about this too.
	But they are so sure about this, so he doesn’t ask future more about this.
	But now, that’s obviously not it.
	But what if that guy is from the ten members group? Then why does he attack Night. 7?
	Night. 7 gets back to normal, and she’s recalling her memories.
	“Oh, right!” Night. 7 opens her eyes widely, she crouches and looks at Ian, says to him seriously, “When Gilberts are being killed, someone leaves us and goes with your grandma by order.”
	“Who’s that?” Ian is surprised, he asks.
	“Night. 9.” Night. 7 is dignified, “He’s the only one that’s not with us that day, but when the four of them are killed, we thought he and Miss Gilbert can’t escape too.”
	“But my grandma is still alive after that, and she married Jack, then Night. 9 must be alive isn’t it?” Ian follows her thought.
	At that time for Gilberts’ underground’s power and wealth, the ten members group is supposed to take five of them to fight with Gilberts, but Night. 9 takes an order from the leader of Gilberts, and Miss Gilbert, who’s Jamie’s mom Ian’s grandma leaves.
	That time in the ten members group, four of them are older, and six of them, saying there are in the group is too much, they are more like training to be the heir, they are too young, so the sacrifice is mostly by the older ones.
	This is almost for the future, Night. 1 waited for the five of them to survive, and secretly taking care of Gilberts’ property and power, waiting for the master of the Myth ring.
	Waiting for these many for years, and finally he welcomed Ian Moore——not any other guy—— he has the Gilberts’ blood, and he’s a male, he’s the most qualified person.
	Night. 7 nods her head, she’s not looking good, since Night. 9 is still alive, why doesn’t he meet with her, but even attacked her.
	Does he change since so many years have passed by?
	Ian thinks for a while, and his mind flashes a light, he quickly catches the light, and asks Night. 7, “Night. 7, do you know how Jack is now?”
	“I know, he becomes low-key after that time his house explodes, Moore enterprise is barely standing because of you and your dad, but.” Night. 7 wrinkles and continues, “But Jake is not going back to help Moore enterprise, and he’s rarely appears.”
	“That’s weird, Jake’s most important thing is his company’s property, then why is he so calm when the Moore enterprise is almost fallen, not finding my mom and not doing anything?”
	Ian put his arm on his chair, his hand is holding his chin, he seems like he’s not that care, but his eyes betrays him.
Chapter 347: Let Night. 1 Come Back
	To get the mysterious ring from his grandma and poisons her, controls his grandma and uses his mom’s life to threaten his grandma, making grandpa and uncle not dare to act rashly, Ian doesn’t believe Jack will look at his company falls.
	Also, that time Night. 9 follows his grandma and gets in Moore’s house, is there any possibility that the owner of Night. 9 is Jack?
	Even though he doesn’t know how Jack makes Night. 9 to help him, but there’s one thing for sure, Night. 9 is not with them.
	Night. 7 thinks and understands what Ian means, she nods, “I know what to do now.”
	“You have to be careful too, Night. 9 is also from the group, he must have holding a part of Gilberts’ property or power, quickly make a research, we’ll discuss this later.” Ian says to Night. 7 clearly, his mind is clear and long-term.
	He looks like a child no matter how you look at, but in Night. 7’s perspective at that moment, Ian’s small figure is becoming bigger.
	“Yes!” Night. 7 answers.
	“Right, let Night. 1 comes back few days later.” Ian sees Night. 7 is about to leave and says.
	Night. 7 stops for a second and nods, then she leaves happily.
	…
	Eleven in the night, the television is playing some ads, Jamie is cuddling her pillow and can’t help yawning on the couch.
	Then she finally can’t hold anymore and sleeps.
	Not for long, outside of the resort has a sound of the car turning off, Dan is walking in the resort.
	He is about to go upstairs, but then he sees a cute small face on the couch, he stops and walks towards it.
	Of course, it’s Jamie, his tired face shines some gentle light, and his eyes are so sweet that can drown a person.
	Jamie is deeply asleep, maybe she’s really tired, her breath is even and long, some of her hair naturally falls on her face, it makes her gorgeous face more beautiful, her cheeks have some healthy pink, it looks more natural than blush.
	Dan doesn’t wake her up, but he Night. 1ds down, gently lifts her up and walks upstairs.
	He walks carefully, as if he’s carrying a glass, so caring and cherished.
	He puts her on the bed in the bedroom, covers her with blanket and sits beside her, his finger gently touches her side of the eye, she wrinkles.
	He wants her to come back to have some rest, it seems like she maybe sitting on the couch for the whole time: was she waiting for him?
	Dan doesn’t know if he has to be angry or happy, he gently rubs her hair, then he bends down and kisses her.
	He’s very gently, no other movement.
	But when he opens his eyes, a pair of confusing eyes are staring at him.
	“You…” Jamie wants to talk, but her lips are locked by Dan.
	“Why don’t you keep sleeping?” Dan finally let her go and pinches her cheek.
	Nonsense, what will happen to me if I keep sleeping? Jamie thinks angrily.
	She thought about this morning when he let her go by himself and feels guilty, but even his mom has some misunderstanding in that situation, not to mention her.
	Jamie bites her lips and pushes him, she asks, “How’s Jozo?”
	Dan sees her small move there, but he doesn’t get pushed away, instead he lies beside her and pulls the blanket to cover both of them, he pulls her into his arms closely.
	“……” Jamie’s face is on his chest, she blushes a little, she’s thinking about getting far away from him, but now it’s just too close!
	“She’s fine, but still unconscious.” Dan says and looks at Jamie, her face is saying she ‘s guilty, she’s holding back, biting her lips.
	Dan wrinkles and reaches out a hand to loosen her lips, “I know you just want to give her the soup, it’s not because of you, don’t be guilty.”
	“But you kick me away today.” Jamie lowers her head and says.
	Dan smiles, when does he kick her away? Is it because this morning when he tells her to come back and rest, but he’s upset about Ryan, so he talks a little too harsh on her?
	“Dumb.” He says and kisses her again, he bites her lips.
	Jamie feels pain and wants to push him away, but then he hugs her even harder, not for long, she’s not resisting anymore and leans on his chest.
	In there, the beautiful scenery rotates and blurs.
	-
	The news about Jamie’s falling status is faded after a few days.
	Because the other media captures Dan brings Jamie and Ian to a restaurant happily, after this news, the news before no longer holds.
	But this thing is not doing it by purpose, it’s because that day they went to attend an appointment from Dan’s parent.
	And Jamie, because of this gathering, meets Amelia since they haven’t met for a long time.
	Amelia is still the same as before, perfectly make up, fashion clothing, and she looks good.
	After those things, Amelia doesn’t say or do anything bad to Jamie in front of Dan anymore.
	She suffers a lot in front of Jamie before, so she finally learns.
	After lunch, Dan’s parent suggests going to the hot spring, Williams never go out and play together before, don’t even think about hot spring, and it is December’s weather, so hot spring is the perfect choice.
	The hot spring there is separating male and female, so Jamie is with Dan’s mom and Amelia.
	There’s Dan’s mom here, Jamie feels relief, because at least she doesn’t have to listen to Amelia’s sarcasms, she wants to relax too.
	But then suddenly, Dan’s mom is going to the toilet, so she leaves, there’s only her and Amelia left in the hot spring.
	The atmosphere suddenly becomes quiet and weird, so Jamie closes her eyes, free her mind and assume there’s no one here…
	But Amelia may not let her does this, looking at Jamie closing her eyes, she sneers, “Making Jozo becomes like this and still have the mood to come here? People who have no conscience are like you, right?”
Chapter 348: Is She Mad?
	She knew it. Jamie acts like she doesn’t hear anything and continue closing her eyes.
	“What’s good about woman like you except for lying man? Who’s gonna look up to you except for my brother?” Amelia sees her ignorance and ridicules her even harder.
	She sees taunting Jamie as her fun since that thing happen, taunting her every time she sees her is making her feels good.
	Jamie will kill her if she knows she has this kind of abnormal psychology.
	What a crazy woman.
	“You think a person like you can be a part of our Williams’ family? HAHA!”
	Then, Amelia suddenly smiles, she gets closer to Jamie, “You thought I really want to say that to you?”
	This is like a miracle, she’s criticizing Jamie literally one second before, then she’s smiling to her now…?
	Jamie can’t help looking up to the sky, wondering if she has got mad today.
	“Then what do you want to say?”
	“I wanna say that, since I can’t fight with you, why don’t we make peace? Because fighting makes me tired too.” Amelie says and her face is rarely gentle today.
	Oh my, is the sun coming up from west and going down to the east?
	Jamie is shocked and she’s aware, “What do you want?”
	Amelia blinks her innocent eyes, “Don’t you wanna make peace with me? I’m for real right now.”
	She sees Jamie isn’t answering, then she continues, “We have to live together since you are marrying my brother afterwards, fighting you is no good for me, and will cost my lovely brother, what do you think?”
	Amelia has her reason, fighting with her and making the relationship with Dan bad, she doesn’t want that.
	The reason that Amelia will change may be that Dan is not caring her recently, so she’s worrying.
	“Are you for real?” Jamie is thinking about it.
	“Of course, let go of the things that happens before, I will not fight you anymore.”
	The things that happens before…
	Jamie’s heart trembles for a second, this thing is still her biggest guilt.
	She looks at Amelia and nods seriously, “Okay, peace.” Then she reaches her hand out to shake.
	Amelia also reaches her hand out, they shake hand.
	Amelia’s corners of her lips evoke a cold arc and it’s hard to see, then it turns back to normal quickly, looking at Jamie.
	Jamie doesn’t think that much, she just feels like these many years have passes by, Amelia hates her for so long, and they can finally make peace, it feels not bad.
	So, she eats more than before on the dinner…
	After dinner, Amelia pulls Jamie to the observation deck to see the night view, her move makes Dan and Ian shock, even Dan’s parent is shocked.
	Amelia changes?
	After seeing the night view, Jamie’s phone rings.
	She’s wearing a white winter coat, and her pocket is small, so she puts her phone to her bag.
	She’s looking for her phone and finally finds it at the pocket in her bag.
	Amelia is looking at her when she’s finding her phone, Amelia is a little impatient when she’s finding but then she stops when she sees a thing in Jamie’s bag, and she snatches it.
	“Eh? Isn’t this Jozo’s thing? Why is it here?” Amelia looks at the thing in her hand and says, that’s why it’s so familiar.
	She has seen this thing in Jozo’s bag before, she thinks that’s beautiful and wants to take from Jozo, but Jozo says this is a important thing to her and can’t give it to her, even though she’s not happy, but she never takes things that someone loves, so she doesn’t bother.
	But she doesn’t think she will see this at Jamie, but why does Jamie have a thing from Jozo?
	Jamie checks her phone and realizes it’s just a message about bills, she deletes it and shuts off her phone, she sees Amelia is holding her clan emblem and takes it over without thinking, “This is from my family.”
	“Your family?” Amelia is confused, “But I do see Jozo has one too, does your family gives her too?”
	Her words make Jamie’s eyes shine, she can’t help grabbing the clan emblem tighter, “You said, Jozo has one too?”
	This is Lockwood’s clan emblem, nobody from the outside will get this, her brother Chris once said, his crew at City C has one too!
	“Yeah.”
	“Jozo… does she comes from France? Is she French?” Jamie can’t hold her excitement, she keeps asking.
	Amelia feels weird of her excitement, but now she has to use her to recover the relationship between her and her family, so she doesn’t get angry, she answers, “I don’t know that, but she is coming from France.”
	That’s right, from France, and the clan emblem too, Jozo is the one that her brother sends to help her.
	But…
	Jamie wrinkles, she feels something is wrong, because before this, July said to her, she’s the one that her brother sends, and she did say her brother’s name, but she doesn’t have the clan emblem.
	But then Jozo… Even though she has the emblem, but she doesn’t seem like who her brother sends.
	Since Jozo is born, she seems like she’s to get closer to Dan, but if she’s the one her brother sends, why is she not helping her and instead she’s making it worse?
	It’s so confusing…
	Jamie is distressed and shakes her head, under Amelia’s confusing eyes, she asks, “Amelia, is Jozo still in the hospital?”
	“No, she’s taking a rest at home, do you want to meet her?” Amelia feels even more confused, even though Dan proves that Jamie is not the one that put things in Jozo’s soup, but doesn’t Jamie feel wronged and mad?
	And she even wants to see Jozo?
	What a merciful holy virgin, boo.
	Amelia is sneering in her mind, but her face is still friendly.
	“Can you help me?” Jamie asks.
	“Of course, we are friends now.” Amelia laughs and hit Jamie’s shoulder, I don’t bother to help you, I’m just scare of you wary of me.
	Jamie feels relieved, she can know the answer only if she meets Jozo, so she just has to wait till tomorrow.
	Before she sleeps, she runs in Ian’s room with a sneaky face, she closes the door and lifts Ian from the computer desk and puts him down on the floor.
Chapter 349: To Maintain Secrecy
	In Bunny’s room, there is a blue soft carpet lying on the floor, which is clean and warm.
	“Mum, do not often pick and hang up your sweetheart.” Bunny casts a glance at his mum with a little dissatisfaction. At that moment, the video game is still on.
	“Ok, ok. I will not.” It’s a rare chance that Jamie doesn’t call him the little rabbit. Then she sits down and seems that she wants to say something，“My sweety, let’s talk something over.”
	Then she talks about what happened today with Bunny. Because this thing has some connection with the family Lockwood, she can’t tell Dan but ask some advice from the smart Bunny.
	Bunny listens carefully and then says, “Mum, Jozo is unreliable. It seems that she is not appointed and sent here by uncle, but by Jack Moore…”
	“Can you help me find some relevant information about Jozo?” Without hesitation, Jamie takes the laptop and puts it in front of Bunny
	Bunny quits the game and tries to find out something about Jozo.
	Soon, all about Jozo are found out, but most shows nothing.
	“It’s so weird. Why such little information…” Jamie feels a little worried and now dares not to say Jozo is someone sent here by her brother.
	“Maybe uncle washes up her history in order to maintain secrecy. But mum, if not so, what should we do?”
	Let’s see. There must be someone doing so on purpose, but it’s uncertain whether it is Chris Lockwood.
	“Why not call uncle, mum?”
	Jamie’s eyes light up but get faded very soon. “I can’t. I have made several calls, but they are not in service, so I don’t know where your uncle is.”
	“It’s OK, mum. You can go and size up the situation to see whether it is true. I’m on the duty to contact uncle. I will tell you as soon as I get some information.” Bunny comforts his mum with a warm and healing smile on his face.
	“You are the most reliable baby for me, so do not marry any other girl in case you don’t care your mum any more. What would I do without you?” Immediately, overwhelmed with Bunny’s cuteness, Jamie says as she squeezes Bunny’s little face.
	Bunny silently glances at someone who is somehow standing behind his mum and pretends to be confused, “How about my dad?”
	“Don’t care about him. He can survive on his own. But I need you…Ah, what’ the hell?” Jamie didn’t mean what she said, but now she is just saying in high spirit when she has been lifted up on one’s shoulder.
	When she looks down, she finds he is Dan William.
	Ah… so he has heard what she said just now?
	With a grimace, seeing him laughing secretly, Jamie glares at Bunny and shows a spanking pose. The little rabbit dare play trick on me. He is asking for the trouble!
	“Dan, Dan, you are so strong so that it’s useful to take regular exercise. Are you tired carrying me? Let me give you a massage…”
	Hearing the sound of her mum begging for mercy fade away gradually, Bunny can’t help rolling in the aisles.
	Obviously, the little handsome boy did this on purpose. Because he will see his little sister sooner as long as his dad is being jealous.
	Bunny hopes his little sister will look like his mum so that she will be very cute!
	Imagining the beautiful blueprint of future, Bunny’s smile is getting more warm and cute.
	As planned yesterday, Jamie has got Jozo’s address from Amelia, and has found the villa where Jozo lives now.
	From Amelia, Jamie heard that this villa is one of Dan’s possessions. Here in Country C, Jozo has no friends or relatives. Out of worry for her, Dan William arranged her to live here.
	Amelia’s deliberately inciting words didn’t discomfort Jamie, because now she just want to know Jozo’s identity .
	She begins to ring the doorbell, and then Alma comes.
	Seeing Jamie, Alma is a bit surprised and opens the door to let Jamie in.
	“Hello, sister Alma. I want to see Jozo.” Jamie looks at Alma with a friendly smile on her face. She still remembers that in her childhood, she often played with Alma and Derek. Alma didn’t like smiling but she knew Alma was very kind.
	“Hello.” Alma replies, and then leads her to the room of Jozo. Standing outside the door, Alma knocks on it.
	Jozo should have been in hospital, but she hates the smell of disinfection in the hospital, so she asked Dan William to let her leave there. And now there won’t be any problem as long as Alma and the medical team dispatched by Dan are on her side.
	It was a pity that the car accident has caused Jozo’s paralyzed legs more serious. Dan felt so guilty that he punished Alma for the reason that she didn’t take good care of Jozo.
	“My lady Jamie, come in please.” Alma stands beside the door, making a sign of invitation.
	Jamie nods her head, but seeing the clear whip scar left on Alma’s neck, she feels slightly terrified. There is only one person who can punish Alma— Dan William.
	Alma has always been strong-minded. It will be worse if Jamie shows concern about her.
	Jamie draws back her sight on Alma. She pushes the door open and walks into it.
	Jozo is reaching out to take the book on the desk beside her bed when Jamie comes in. Seeing this, Jozo pulls back her hands, smiling to Jamie.
	Jamie slightly winks her watery eyes for seemly seeing something strange, but it has gone instantly.
	Jamie can’t tell why and she looks around but still finds nothing, so she gives up and goes up to the front, facing Jozo.
	“Hello, miss Jozo. I’m sorry to bother you without any invitation.” Jamie says with a faint smile.
	Seeing Jozo, She is still a little unhappy.
	“It doesn’t matter. I’m happy to see you.” Jozo says with a tender and sweet smile and her sound can seemly soften one’s bones.
	“Why Miss Jamie comes to see me? Is there anything important?”
	“Yes.” Jamie nods.
	“Please be seated.” Jozo signals Jamie to sit in the sofa by the side.
	Jamie looks at ease, and she pulls a stool and sits down. Then let’s see what she will say next.
	“From Amelia, I heard that you have a pendant. Is that true?” Jamie didn’t make it clear that it was a family badge. Now she takes it out and put in front of Jozo and says, “Do you know this?”
	Jozo looks so surprised, like questioning why she has this. Jozo replies,” This a family badge. It belongs to the family Lockwood.
	Jamie is shocked at her answer.
	Jozo knows this badge and even knows who it belongs to. So she must be the one sent by her brother.
	“Can you let me see your badge?” Still with some wariness, Jamie dare not easily to believe. After all, this matter is of great importance.
	Unexpectedly, Jozo is the one sent by Jamie’s brother. This news makes her feel heartbroken.
	My big brother, why the one you sent here takes a fancy to Dan? How distressed Jamie is now!
Chapter 350: The One I Need to Protect
	Without any hesitation, Jozo takes out her wallet, and hands it to Jamie.
	The badge hanging on it is the same with Jamie’s. It is true.
	The badge of the family Lockwood can’t be fake.
	“Who give this to you? Do you know who I am?” Jamie asks.
	With a tender smile, Jozo looks at Jamie knowing clearly what Jamie means, “You are the little sister of Chris, the one I need to protect.”
	Sure enough right now.
	Jamie doesn’t know why she is not happy but feel a little disappointed.
	“Seeing what you have done, it doesn’t seem to protect me.” This makes Jamie feel most confused.
	It seems that Jozo is not to protect her, but to do her harm.
	“If I do it obviously, my identity will be exposed. I know you mind me getting close to Dan William, but really there is only friendship between us. And if I didn’t get close to him, how can I be close to you?” Jozo explains so clearly that it’s hard not to believe.
	Jamie nods her head. It’s reasonable, but she still feels something wrong.
	Is she too sensitive?
	If all Jozo has said is true, why July Summer can know something about her brother?
	“By the way, when did you get married with Dan? I haven’t heard of that from your brother before.” Jozo appears to ask unconsciously. “Many are saying you two got married 5 years ago, why are you two still apart?
	Jamie frowns, wondering if this is what other people are saying?” No, this is just an announcement the public but it isn’t the real truth.
	The reason why Jamie said so was that on the first night of getting married, Dan told Jamie that she couldn’t tell the truth to anyone except the one you can trust.
	Jamie didn’t know what he was going to do, but now Jozo still isn’t the one she can trust enough.
	Jozo nods her head and looks a little relaxed.
	“Take care of yourself, I will pay another visit later.” After making sure the identity of Jozo, Jamie stands up and says.
	“Thanks. Take care.” Jozo nods with a smile on her face.
	Jamie has to say, Jozo behavior showed just now is really almost the one who comes to protect her.
	Jamie is still a little confused after leaving. She can't get in touch with her brother now, and she doesn't know who she can trust.
	But now she has to believe it.
	There is enough evidence so that Jamie has to do so.
	“Ah… Still there is something strange.” Jamie suddenly stops and cocks her head to think. She recalls when she went into Jozo’s room, she saw Jozo was about to take a book. And at that time, she was a little strange, but she didn’t figure out that.
	Now she thinks it twice. It should be the legs of Jozo.
	When she just went in, she saw Jozo bending her legs in the quilt, but her legs should have been paralyzed, so it is impossible to make the movement of bending the legs.
	Is she wrong?
	She feels something wrong but she can’t say why.
	Jamie finally decides not to think about it and drives to leave.
	Soon after Jamie leaving, Jozo takes out a phone under the quilt. Looking at the phone still recording the voice, she shows a smug smile, then turns off the record and sends it to someone.
	Since the last winter fashion show, Jamie’s status has been elevated to the point. Country C is no smaller than the UK, so after her fans knowing she is Miss R, they spend almost every day waiting outside the CR building to see her. The fans are almost as crazy as that of the stars.
	But Jamie has been taking a break these days and hasn’t been to the office for a week. Her Secretary Zhang told her that the company was bursting with calls from people who wanted to make an appointment with her.
	However, Jamie underestimated her fans, and she hasn’t imagined that the fans are so strong-willed that they can spend several days sitting outside the building and finally are driven away, but those fans choose to be waiting nearby the building, not getting close.
	Now Dan William is standing in front of the full-height glass windows, looking down like a king with nobleness and elegance. Only seeing his back, you can feel his charm.
	“My honey Jamie has been spirit away because of you, so you should make up for this! Do you know after Jamie leaving, our company’s business has dropped like a stone?” A sexy British English vocal sound goes from the computer behind Dan. The words seem to imply another meaning.
	Hearing Katt John’s complaints, a smile lifts the corner of Dan’s mouth. He turns around, sits in his office chair and looks at Katt’s annoyed expression, saying with pride, “I can’t help it. I’m so charming.”
	“Just you wait! Now I will rush to country C to bring Jamie back!” Katt gnashed his teeth waiting for Dan’s reply. Although Katt is unconvinced but he has to admit Dan has the charm that can make people surrender.
	Katt also looks handsome, but why Jamie has no interest for him?
	Katt feels so frustrated.
	Dan frowns slightly, feels unhappy to hear Katt calling “honey Jamie”, but he doesn’t expose his feeling and says,” Welcome anytime if you are sure she will follow you back away.”
	At once, Katt looks distressed. It’s true. Jamie will go with him only if she is willing to.
	It’s only his own wishful thinking.
	However, Katt still doesn’t want to give up. Since Jamie joined FS, he has been watching at her, seeing her being stronger to conquer drawbacks, and finally became the top designer of FS.
	Katt can help her remove barriers, but the key is she has the ability to make it.
	Katt had had many lovers and changed girlfriends like changing clothes before he met Jamie. He was too demanding on women and he wouldn’t show his favor if the woman wasn’t qualified. Indeed, he has the capital to do so.
	But Katt never thought he would be defeated by the foxy girl— Jamie.
	“Don’t be so proud. I will keep watching at you. Only if there is a chance, I will bring my honey back!” Katt says with much confidence and elegance, which makes him charming and shining.
	“Waiting for your coming.” Dan glances at Katt, answering casually. And then he turns off the video conversation, paying no attention to Katt anymore, only leaving him stunned on the other side. 
Chapter 351: Simply the Scum of Society
	To Katt’s astonishment, Dan just ignored his declaration of war between two real men.
	Katt feels so angry now, and the situation will turn out to be worse.
	After thinking a while, a good idea suddenly occurs to him, and an insidious and foxy expression climbs up on his face.
	Noticing an overseas e-mail sent via the internet, Dan frowns, and then opens it but instantly his perfect face turns somber.
	Because in that e-mail are all photos of Jamie, including photos of her in sexy dress, photos of her back or full face from the front. From the point of view, these photos are captured secretly, but they all look good.
	Dan can’t believe Jamie would wear so few clothes and to be exposed to many other men.
	Staring at the screen, Dan looks more somber and threatening. He copies all photos in a document folder, adds a password protection, and finally deletes that e-mail.
	Then boss Dan takes an action.
	He hacks the FS system, plants a few viruses by the way, and hacks Ethan's computer, bringing up the large scale photos of Katt and his lovers he had saved on his computer.
	He then packages the pictures into a compressed file and sends it directly to Secretary Zhang, asking her to contact a well-known British newspaper, and to send the file to it.
	After finishing this, boss Dan looks a little better. He starts to continue his work leisurely.
	Since Dan gave Jamie a car, it has been more convenient for Jamie to get around, and she had no need to bother Cindy.
	Bunny needs to go to school from Monday to Friday, so during the time it is Jamie and the servants who take care of Kiki.
	There is no canned food for Kiki to eat, so Jamie decides to go out to buy some canned food.
	Although Kiki looks cute and difficult to keep, in fact, it is very easy to keep. It is not particular about food. All the canned food Dan bought before are introduced in English, but Jamie still remembers some of them.
	"Oh, my god. Simply a dog can is almost worth the money for my one-week snacks." Jamie is surprised at the price of the can, and her smiling face immediately becomes frozen.
	In this world, dogs lives better than people...
	Jamie reluctantly takes a few cans from the shelf, and then takes some from another location.
	Jamie estimates that her purse will be flat after she pays for it.
	Just as Jamie sighs, a heavy cardboard box above her head is teetering on the edge because it has been placed much near to the edge and is too heavy.
	At that moment, Jamie is still looking at the dog cans and making comparisons. She tries to recall the brand that Kiki has been eating. It takes her a while to think it over, and she recalls some brands finally.
	“That's it then..." She looks at the English on the can, nods, and put the other one back.
	“Look out! There is a loud scream, and Jamie looks back with the can in her hand, seeing a figure coming toward her, and before she recovers her senses, she has been brought to the ground.
	Bump! Bump!
	The cardboard box on the top of the container falls to the ground with a dull thud and it is full of red wine. If it hit Jamie, it would be terrible.
	The saleswoman comes up at once after hearing the sound. She looks livid when she notices the red wine spread over the floor, but when she finds Jamie fall down, she suddenly realizes it has been a big trouble.
	Jamie has been brought to the ground by a man, who holds the back of her head in his palms to keep it from hitting the ground. Now she slightly opens her eyes, seeing a familiar and handsome face.
	“Brother... brother Chris?" Jamie looks at Chris, a flash of surprise appears in her eyes.
	Chris, wearing a burgundy cap and matching scarf, holds his forefinger to his lips in a gesture of silence, and then stands up with a graceful turn and pulls Jamie up.
	"Did you break all the wine on purpose?" Coming to her senses, the saleswoman shouts at Jamie and Chris, and angrily approaches.
	Goods in this section are all imported. Although there are only six bottles, the price of each bottle is worth several-month salary of the salesgirl. She cannot afford to pay for it even at the cost of selling herself.
	So she made a quick decision and put all the blame on Jamie and Chris. Since no one else had seen it, nobody knew the truth that it was a mistake and it almost injured someone.
	Now Chris looks at the woman with his amber eyes, and though he shows an elegant smile, he still makes the woman feel cold from the bottom of her heart. "Miss., are you sure we broke it?"
	After that, he puts his hand under the girl's chin with a little frivolousness, though. Simply seeing that handsome face, any woman would be tempted.
	A red blush shows on the woman’s face and she doesn’t dare to look Chris directly in the eyes, but at the thought of the high compensation, she still thinks that money is more important.
	“You can go only if you pay for it according to the price."
	“Pardon?" Chris deepens his smile. "Are you sure we broke it?"
	“This is such a big shopping mall, so there must be surveillance video. Since you say we broke it, we will know the truth as long as we go to check the video. I believe we not only don’t need to compensate, but also we will get the compensation. Jamie stares at the woman with cold eyes, feeling a little dissatisfied with her.
	The saleswoman didn't show her pity for what have happened just now but she tried to put all the blame on them. Are the goods more important than the lives of the customers? This kind of person is simply the scum of society.
	The woman's face turns pale now and she looks at Jamie and Chris in horror.
	“What do you think we should do, dear?" Chris catches Jamie by her shoulder and leans close to her face, as intimate as a couple.
	Jamie's remains the same expression, but only casts a funny glance at Chris who has not changed at all. “let’s compound in private." Jamie replies.
	Finally, the manager of the shopping mall fired the clerk, and apologized solemnly to Jamie and Chris, and promised to pay them for their emotional distress, but Jamie refused it.
	“My darling, when you stopped being greedy? Aren't you supposed to smile and take the money and then happily count it?" Chris puts his arm around Jamie’s shoulder and leaves together with a shopping bag in his one hand.
	"Is your sister so greedy? Please watch your language!" Threatening Chris with a sweet smile, Jamie gives him a hard pinch on his waist. 
Chapter 352: A Conscience Stir
	Jamie just thought that there was nothing wrong with her, and that she would’ve had a conscience stir if she had taken the money.
	“That's necessary, otherwise I will be cold-shouldered by you and bunny every day." Chris laughs, bright and seductive, attracting passersby’s attention.
	"Let’s go. Go to your own brother’s home. It’s not safe, here." Chris says, leading Jamie to his car, a black commercial vehicle.
	Jamie looks around casually, and she doesn't see anything. Since Chris has said so, there are indeed hidden dangers around.
	So they makes several turns on the Youzi Street and then several turns on the Mugua Street, making sure no one is following them before heading to the correct direction.
	"Brother, why do you suddenly come to Country C? Aren't you worried you'll be found out by Jack?" Jamie asks, looking curiously at Chris, who is sitting nearby.
	"You look down on me. Since I’m here now, it turns out that I haven’t been found." Chris looks at her complacently, shaking his forefinger, and stretching out his hand to pat the snow off from her hair, his amber eyes sparkling with spoiled love.
	Chris touches Jamie's cold-striken red nose. Then he takes his scarf off his neck and puts it around Jamie’s neck softly and gently. "Why not wear a scarf on such a cold day?"
	Jamie sticks out her tongue and let Chris help her wear the scarf, shyly, "I forget it."
	Though Chris and Jamie met late, it was said that he has always been watching her. Jamie just didn’t know it. Jamie and Chris are pigeon twins, and Chris was born only a few minutes earlier than her. They look alike, but Chris is more appealing like Anthony and Jamie is more like Adele.
	Blood is thicker than water, and for the first time they met each other, Jamie showed affection toward Chris, only to learn later that he was her own brother.
	They separated from each other at different places, all felt like intimate families at first sight and didn’t feel strange at all, which was better off than living together all the time. Chris has always been treating Jamie very well.
	Otherwise he would not have come to Country C and kept it a secret from Anthony.
	"Maris, turn up the heating." Chris says to his assistant who is driving the car. Then he takes out a small bottle from the side of the compartment, and sprays it in the car, “It smells like mint, and I have made the designer modulate it carefully. So it is refreshing and will not make you feel uncomfortable."
	"My brother, I am allergic to perfume, and it will cause skin rash." Jamie's watery eyes are wide open in an instant, and she looks in horror at the bottle in Chris's hands.
	“It doesn’t matter, this is modulated just according to your condition, so take it easy, and you absolutely will not be allergic." Chris frowns a little. It’s no wonder that Jamie has never used perfume and felt disgusted with its smell. That's the reason.
	Fortunately, he doesn’t have the habit of using perfume.
	"Thanks, my brother." Jamie smiles softly at Chris just like a little lovely girl.
	From an early age Jamie asked her mother why she did not have a brother, and if she had one, she would have had someone to play with.
	And if she was bullied, she should have been very proud and arrogant to tell that person that she would ask her elder brother to come to protect her!
	Looking at Chris, Jamie feels delighted because it can be seen the proof that her childhood dream has come true.
	People must have a dream. What if it comes true?
	"Silly girl, I am your brother, so you don’t need to say thanks." Chris smiles gently and reaches out to rub Jamie's hair.
	The time to chat with his brother is always short. Jamie keeps talking until night and still feels not enough, but if now Chris doesn’t hurry back home for dinner, he will be late.
	After leaving the secret place where Chris lives now, Jamie asks Chris to take her back to shopping mall where she bought the canned food for dogs, and finally she drives her own car back home.
	It is 6:30 am when she comes back. Dan and bunny is sitting at the table waiting for her.
	“I’m so sorry that I’m late.” Seeing the father and the little son, she apologizes. Then she hands the shopping bag to Cindy and says, “This is for Kiki.”
	“Ok, Mrs. William.” Cindy takes it with a smile, and leaves the kitchen.
	Mrs. William?
	Jamie suddenly feels a little tranced, and possibly hasn’t adapted to this appellation. From Miss. to Mrs., she seems to feels like she is aging faster…
	Dan has been watching Jamie since she walked in. Seeing the scarf around her neck that is obviously not for girls, he is shocked.
	“Where did you go?” Dan asks, gracefully taking the fork to enjoy the dinner.
	“I went to the store to buy some canned food for Kiki.” After washing hands, looking at the dishes, Jamie feels a little hungry right now.
	Bunny silently looks at the face of his dad, and then at his mum. Seemingly he has known what is happening now. Daddy doesn’t like to talk too much, and mommy is dull.
	Just as Jamie wants to eat, she feels discomfort around her neck. Then she realizes that she is still wearing Chris's scarf, so she takes it off, folds it carefully, and puts it away.
	Bunny wants to cover his face, and dares not see his daddy’s more dangerous look as if dad would eat someone at any time. Bunny pretends not to notice that.
	'Whose scarf is it? The knife and fork in Dan's hands fall to the plate with a clang. As soon as he reaches out his hand, he grabs the scarf placed behind Jamie, which carries a faint smell of men's shampoo that can’t have come from Jamie's.
	Dan doesn’t have a scarf in that color, so today she stayed with a man, and...Very close? 
Chapter 353: It’s Ryan’s
	Dan stares at Jamie with his black eyes getting more threatening, waiting for her explanation.
	Jamie is about to say it’s Chris’s when she remembers that before Chris left, he had told her not to tell anyone that he was in Country C, including bunny. Chris would have not turned up today if Jamie hadn't suddenly been in danger.
	Chris must have his reasons for saying so, and now the situation is an extraordinary one, so she can’t tell Dan...
	Jamie feels tangled but immediately says, "It's Ryan's.”
	She feels sorry about Ryan, thinking, “now I can only take you as a shield. Please don't blame me…”
	The reason why Jamie says so is that Ryan happens to have such a wine-red scarf.
	When she finishes, Dan stares at her for a few seconds. Feeling guilty that she just lied, Jamie doesn’t dare to look directly into his eyes.
	Dan compresses his thin lips and says nothing. He just puts the scarf back and his eyes looks frosty. Finally he just says, "Eat."
	Jamie bites her lips and looks carefully up at Dan. She can see nothing but Dan’s pale face.
	Now the atmosphere is also getting cold. The sudden change makes Jamie sniff. Is the heating out of order?
	Dan doesn’t say a word to Jamie until he goes to sleep at night. After bathing, he takes a book and sits on the bed, reading it.
	Jamie feels depressed and doesn't understand what’s wrong with Dan. Is it because she just said she stayed with Ryan, which makes him angry?
	But now she looks at Dan, who is cold and aloof sitting by the side of the bed. There is no expression on his face, no sign of anger, as if he is not angry.
	Jamie feels increasingly confused.
	Jamie goes gloomily into the bathroom, pouting her lips.
	After coming out, Dan is still reading in the same position as before. She goes to the water dispenser and pours a glass of water to drink. She can’t help glancing at the book in Dan’s hands, and immediately she is shocked.
	She's been in the bathroom for twenty minutes. How come he's still on the same page?
	After thinking a while, she puts the glass of water on the table next to her. Then she tiptoes around to the other side of the bed, lifts the quilt and worms towards Dan. She winks at him with her eyes.
	Her smile is ingratiating and soft, with a touch of coyness. “Dan?"
	Dan doesn’t watch her at all, and then turns to another page.
	“Dan? Why you pay no attention to your baby Jamie?” Jamie is upset with her lips puckering up. Since the time we had dinner, he haven’t say a word to her. She knows she is wrong because she just lied to him. But she has her own reasons not to tell him.
	My God! Did he find that?
	Mentioning “baby Jamie”, Jamie feels a little awkward. But Dan has said that those are close to her all call her Jamie, so he worked out this nickname. Although it is a name more likely to call a child, Jamie still feels it is so sweet like honey.
	Hearing “baby Jamie” Dan finally turns to look at Jamie, but just a glance, and then he looks back again without saying a word.
	Did she experience his conversational chill?
	Baby Jamie’s heart is suffering pains and grievance.
	Jamie sniffs, continues to rub close to Dan, and finally almost sticks to his body. She hugs around Dan’s strong waist, sticks her face to him, rubbing his chest, and says, “I’m so cute and lovely. Why you pay no attention to me?”
	Dan feels a little speechless. Generally, to flatter an angry man, she should keep praising him. But why she keeps saying how lovely she is?
	Thinking she lied to him today, Dan thinks he should temporarily neglect her so that she can realize she has done something wrong.
	He puts down the book, throws it away, then puts her hands away from his waist, and finally lies down, only showing his back to Jamie without saying anything.
	Bad man! She can’t believe she has been ignored.
	Jamie tugs at the corner of the quilt and peers piteously at Dan’s back, emitting a steady stream of resentment.
	But after then, Jamie still gives in. She has done something wrong, so she has to admit it.
	Then she sticks up to Dan again, rubbing tightly close to him.
	Dan easily pushed her aside without any hesitation, to show that he refuses to get close to her.
	How can she give up!
	Jamie’s desire to win is stimulated by Dan’s behavior. As soon as Dan retracts his hands, she immediately rubs close to him once more. Then they repeat it again and again…
	This goes on for several times until Jamie is about to be exhausted and finally feels depressed. She tucks a corner of the quilt, pouting her lips.
	Then she glares at Dan’s back for quite a while, and turns around with anger just like what Dan is doing now.
	You ignore me. I will do the same to you.
	Jamie thinks about it naively just like a child, and finally closes her eyes with anger.
	Closing her eyes, for a while she feels her head in the clouds and quickly drowsiness sweeps over her. When she becomes dizzy and sleepy, she gets a big hug, and a faint flavor of man lingers around her.
	Jamie can still feel it with some consciousness. Knowing that who is hugging her, she intends to laugh but holds it back. Doesn't he talk to me? Why now he gets so close to me?
	Gradually, Jamie falls asleep with relief.
	The next morning, Jamie is getting unhappier.
	Now she can still feel the warmth on his quilt, but he has gone.
	Today she got up early at about 7:30 am. Usually at that time, Dan should have lain by her side, but today...
	Jamie feels a little strange. After washing and rinsing, she goes down the stairs.
	Cindy sees her walking down and quickly arranges the breakfast, saying, "Good morning, Mrs. William. Today you get up early."
	"Good morning Cindy." Jamie smiles to her and takes a look at the kitchen, but she doesn't find Dan. She instantly feels upset, "Cindy, does Dan go to work?"
	"Yes. Mr. William has gone to work at 7:00 am." Cindy replies. And then she seems to think of something, adding,"Mr. William doesn't look very well, so is there something wrong ...."
	She suddenly realizes that it is getting worse, and she knows that Dan hates the one who keeps a secret from him, let alone if she lies to him.
	How can she not realize it until now? She feels so stupid.
	After knowing what is going on now, she has no hesitation in leaving for the garage and drives to the company.
	She needs to make it clear to Dan that she has no intention to lie to him. There is a reason for it.
	But when she arrives at Dan’s office, from secretary Zhang she knows that Dan has flown to America, and he won’t get back until at least tomorrow.
Chapter 354: Not to her Heart’s Content
	Jamie Moore wants to leave, but since she didn't come to work these days, all the work has piled up; with no other alternative, she stays at work.
	Sitting in her office, she anxiously draws up the next year’s spring design, finding it not to her heart’s content anyway.
	As she looks at the clothes on the screen that are obviously not in proportion, she feels a headache. Although she is usually very negligent, she can sometimes also be impatient and anxious. If there is an important matter to solve, it must be done quickly or the heart will not be content. After staring at the screen, Jamie Moore throws away the mouse and takes a sketchbook and her favorite log pencil from the small bookshelf, and begins to draw on paper.
	Except for working, she usually draws directly by hand, liking the feeling that inspiration is born from the tip of her pencil. In this way, Jamie Moore is absorbed in her work and no longer worried about how to give Dan William an explanation. After finishing the second body model, Jamie Moore puts down her pencil and stares blankly at the naked body model.
	Dan William will get angry at her as if that has not happened in a long time.
	Jamie Moore pouted in depression. Even though she deceived him, he wouldn’t go so far as to treat her coldly. After thinking about it, she called Wendy to ask for her opinion.
	“Have you been living your life foolishly?”
	Wendy’s voice quickly rose, helpless and blame. How much did she really dislike about this? Jamie Moore swallows her saliva, not speaking a word. “If the roles were reversed, wouldn’t you be angry if he was being intimate with another woman?”
	Wendy’s words leave Jamie Moore speechless. “That man is……is my best friend, and nothing else.” Jamie Moore explains in a low voice, which Wendy perceives as her being guilty.
	“What if that woman is also a good female friend of Dan William? Can you guarantee that you will not be petty and angry?”
	“……I can’t”. Jamie Moore answers as she bites her lower lip. If it was her, she would be more straightforward than Dan William. She wouldn’t eat and would probably sleep in a separate room. But last night, though angry, he – just like in the past – had held her in his arms as she fell asleep, which proves that he was just angry. This man, seemingly proud and charming, cannot let her go even while angry. “Then isn’t it done? What are you upset about? You want to make me so cut up about being single, aren’t you? Wendy rapped indignantly on her desk.
	“Finding a man who loves you unconditionally is not easy. Because of such small matters, don’t……I ought not to say. Jamie Moore was feeling depressed and torn up by her words. She realizes that she is not a rigid fool and that since she was wrong, she should admit her mistake! Wendy’s words had a lot of meaning.
	“Girl, you and Eddie Charlies will soon be engaged. If you’re single, then what about those who don’t even know where their partner is?” In a much better mood, Jamie Moore couldn’t help but tease her, only to receive silence in return. It can’t be……did something happen between Wendy and Eddie Charlies?
	“Girl…”
	“Duke Field, I suppose, was kicked on the head by a donkey. He constantly comes to my house to look for me, and even though I made it very clear to him, he just won’t listen. It makes me really embarrassed in front of my parents.” Wendy sounded distressed, somewhat mad, and helpless. “Duke Field? Going to your house to pester you? Damn, the sun must have risen under your ass today”, Jamie said surprised while sorting out the sketchbooks on her desk. Did she hear it wrong?
	Between Dan William, Bruce Hill, and Duke Field, Dan William is meager and cold, but not as much as Duke Field. He never cares about anything. Even when his mother died, he did not shed a tear. Jamie’s impression of him included three things: Coldhearted, desolate and also proud and arrogant. Dan William is also much more adorable than he is; cold but proud and charming.
	“Yes, god knows what he’s up to. A few days ago, I was making a snowman, and he actually stole a kiss from me! I was seen by my family, and then…...” Jamie could almost downright hear Wendy’s teeth grind together in anger, making her want to strangle Duke Field to death. Jamie let out an easy smile, making her eyes fill with gratification.
	“Girl, since this seems like a misunderstanding, explain it clearly. What are you still depressed about? You like Eddie Charlies, and he likes you. Isn’t that enough?”
	Duke Field was just feeling guilt and regret towards her. Since it was Wendy who blocked the knife and acknowledges her mistake of Joey Lan who had fallen for her. It was obvious that he would regret it now. But now that he shattered the love between Wendy and Eddie Charlies, she despised it. Wendy was silent for a few seconds, before she said, “In that case, what were you upset about just now?”
	Jamie Moore was rendered speechless. She had no more words in her heart, feeling as if she shouldn’t comfort this conscienceless and heartless woman, but stop her with words. “I understand. I’ll go search for him now……but, when I went to look for him at his house, he didn’t open the door for me. When I went to his company, I was held back outside.
	When he later exited the company, he still ignored me, and turned off his phone”. Wendy couldn’t help but start to prattle, each word an accusation and grievance towards Eddie Charlies, even though Jamie Moore feel that there was a certain sweetness to it. In the first place, there are complaints, which are unclearly mixed with sweetness. Jamie Moore let out a soft sigh.
	She wanted to tell her that it was Eddie Charlies who saved her in the first place, but before she could do that, there was a knock on her door. Wendy must have heard the knocking, and knowing Jamie was probably busy, she said, “Go, do your thing. I’ll go……pick some flowers”.
	“Okay.” Jamie Moore couldn’t help laughing. She knew exactly what Wendy was going to do. The woman has great difficulties in choosing. Whenever she encounters a tangled problem, she tries to solve it by picking petals from flowers and murmuring: “go to him, don’t go to him”.
	“Come in”.
	The Vice Minister of the design department came in with a stack of documents, dropping them it in front of her on her desk. “Director Moore, this is the market research report; also in it is next year’s spring clothing report”.
Chapter 355: Fly to America to Find Him?
	Wait for a while?
	Director Moore?
	Meaning who?
	Jamie Moore was stunned for a few seconds. She then fixed her uncertain gaze on the Deputy Director, and softly asks, “Isn’t Shawn Hall the director of the design department? Me?” Seeing her puzzled, the Deputy Director remembered her absence in the company the past few days, so he explained, “Shawn Hall left the company about a month ago. President William officially promoted you as the new Director of the Design Department. Didn’t he tell you?”
	Tell her? When Jamie Moore thought of Dan William’s cold look, she felt a bit resentful. More than that, he didn’t tell her anything, didn’t mention it at all. She thought that becoming CR’s top designer would be the end of her career. It turns out that she can be promoted, even if the promotion was so direct. Shouldn’t she worry about the opinions of others?
	The fact is that she thinks too much. Since after the Winter Fashion Show, Dan William was going to promote her. Who would question her ability in the industry; an ability that is obvious to all. But, since she’s been promoted, shouldn’t she get a salary raise too? At the thought of this, Jamie Moore wanted to secretly smile. However, seeing the Deputy Director in front of her made her put up a confused and puzzled expression; in her eyes, the question was clear to read.
	“Are the President and his wife at odds with each other?”
	She immediately righted her face, and said to herself, “I said what I said, it’s just that I fell asleep and didn’t hear clearly”. The Deputy Director understood right away, his gaze was on Jamie Moore, his eyes clear and ambiguous. It seems like the relationship between the president and his wife is very good. Jamie Moore carelessly glanced at the Deputy Director, knowing that she believed it.
	It made her feel a bit sullen. This kind of thing will make others say that she should have known. It made her upset, knowing that she should have questioned if Dan William’s feelings were not a problem. Even though this was just a temporary problem, if they know about it, then it’s probable that the whole company will know about it today, and tomorrow eventually the whole country.
	She suddenly felt that referring her office to the same floor as his, was the correct thing to do. The Staff of CR was no less than that of FS. If she were to be in the design department below, she feared she would land herself in the same kind of intrigue again.
	“I will read these reports. You can go back.” Jamie Moore said as she grabs the materials in front of her and starts reading.
	“Alright, I won’t disturb you then”. The Deputy Director said before politely leaving Jamie Moore’s office. Staring at the reports, Jamie Moore finds herself unable to read the contents. She rubs her sore eyes, feeling worried creep up on her. Should she book a ticket and fly to America to find him?
	……..Forget it. He’ll be back tomorrow. She’ll just wait then.
	---
	The following day, Jamie Moore shows up at the airport on time. She learned from Secretary Sam that his flight would be today at ten in the morning. At nine o’clock she was already there, looking forward to waiting for him.
	But after half an hour of waiting, Jamie Moore was still waiting for Dan William. Feeling a bit anxious, she calls Secretary Sam to ask if he made a mistake in the itinerary.
	"I'm sorry Madam, but President William changed his flight to eight-thirty this morning.” Secretary Sam said. To half-past eight……Jamie Moore felt her mouth twitch badly. "Is he at the company?"
	“No, I haven’t received any news from President William. If I receive any news, I will inform you immediately.” Looking at the page on the computer, and as expected, he didn’t receive an email from President William. When Dan William goes abroad on business, he always takes Derek William or someone else with him.
	Like every other time, Secretary Sam receives the latest news only after their return to Country C, followed by good preparation. But today is strange, it’s already been an hour and he hasn’t received any news. Secretary Sam doesn’t want to let Jamie Moore think too much, so this is all that he can tell her.
	“Well, thank you”. Jamie Moore as she bit her lip, a ray of loss clear in her eyes.
	“You are welcome. That’s what I do.”
	After hanging up the phone, Jamie Moore exits the airport gate. She looks at the sky in a daze, not sure what to think. She……didn’t have any breakfast this morning, and was feeling very hungry. “What are you thinking about, dear?” A clear voice said, and before Jamie Moore could recover from dreaming about food, a gray scarf was being wrapped around her neck, blocking out the cold. She looked, surprised, at the face before her.
	Even though he was wearing a hat and sunglasses, she could still tell that it was Chris Lockwood. “I’m thinking about what to have for breakfast today. I’m hungry.” Jamie Moore said before smacking her lips shut while rubbing her belly. Since she was really hungry, her face became a litter bitter. “Come on, Darling. I’ll take you to some delicious food”.
	Chris Lockwood said as he put his hands on her shoulder, leading her to his town car. Unbeknownst to them, the whole scene had been witnessed by a man sitting in a black Maybach car. His deep and bright eyes narrowed dangerously. “Young Master, do you want to keep up with the lady?” Derek William asked from the front seat as he looked at his master’s gloomy face in the rearview mirror. Dan William’s pursed his thin lips as his eyes became dim. “No, let’s go”.
	Derek William turns his head, not daring to look Dan William in his dangerous eyes. It was clear that his master was making him go, why would he stare at him now. Young Master, if you would like to follow to see what the lady and the man are up to, don’t stare. As they went for breakfast together, even Chris Lockwood could see that she was in a bad mood. So he took her to relax a bit.
	His French features, however, were too clear, so he could not brazenly go for a walk. After asking Maris's opinion, he takes Jamie Moore out. Bungee jumping, as well as the famous fox sliding rope in City A. Jamie Moore, is afraid of heights, something that won't ever change. She, however, doesn't have any conflicts when it comes to bungee jumping.
	Maybe it's because she isn't feeling well. Ignoring the factors of fear, she happily jumps down from the high platform. However, after her one jump, her happy mood is quickly replaced by a breakdown. As she holds Chris Lockwood, her stomach rolls as if wanting to vomit. But even after not vomiting anything, she still felt uncomfortable. Chris Lockwood commits this to his memory. Jamie Moore was afraid of heights, so he couldn’t bring to the next activity he had planned. In the end, Jamie Moore was too upset, and Chris Lockwood didn’t take her to the slide. Instead, he took her to lunch.
Chapter 356: Come for Your Darling Husband?
	After a short silence, Chris Lockwood spoke. “If something worries you, don’t hold it in your heart.”
	Reaching out, he rubs Jamie's hair as his eyes dote on her.
	“Older brother, I’m okay. It was only the bungee jumping that made me a bit unwell. Jamie Moore lets out a smile, but it wasn’t pretty. Her face was so pale, people would think she was heartbroken and in pain. Chris Lockwood sighs softly as he caresses her hair more gently for fear that he would tear it off.
	If he had to guess, this was all related to the person she likes the most; the man named Dan William. When he found her a few years ago, she looked exactly like she does now. It seemed as if his sister was doomed to forever be a part of that man’s life. Chris Lockwood narrowed his eyes, his thoughts becoming complicated. The sudden ring of a phone distracts Jamie Moore, drawing her back into reality, “Hello?”
	“Madam, I have received news from President William. Tonight, on the ninth floor of the Star theatre, President William will be hosting a party for his friends and acquaintances. I am to enquire if Madam would like to attend the party”. Secretary Sam says over the phone. His words momentarily brought back the illness she had just been feeling. Her eyes shone brightly, and she quickly replied.
	"Tell me the time, and I will be there tonight". After hanging up the phone, Jamie is full of fighting spirit. Although still pale, her drive was returning to her eyes. As long as she knew where Dan William was, she had a way of explaining everything clearly. "Isn't there someplace to be? Let's go. I'll escort you".
	Chris Lockwood must have heard some of what was said on the phone. He gently smiled, giving her encouragement. “Brother, you’re the best”. Jamie Moore happily threw herself into his arms and hugged him. It was nice to have a brother.
	“Silly girl”. Chris Lockwood let out a helpless smile. “You are like my sister. If I’m not good to you, who will be?”
	On the other side, Derek William was watching the two as they hugged in the restaurant, wondering if he should tell the young master about what he was seeing. But at the thought of Dan William’s cold command that time, he decided to report anyways. The night scene is like ink. At about seven o’clock, Jamie Moore arrives at Star Theatre. With a VIP card, she smoothly enters the ninth floor. The party should already be in full swing.
	Standing in front of the door, she hesitates. Should she go in or not? What should she say if she went in? At that time, a waiter passes by her, carrying a vase with flowers. Her eyes flash, and she reaches out and pulls a flower from the vase. “Excuse me, I apologize, I would like to borrow this flower”. She says to the waiter with a smile. The waiter frowns and is just about to say something when he notices that even though Jamie’s clothing was simple, it was the year’s famous winter brand and that on her wrist she was wearing a limited edition Chanel bracelet.
	Without saying anything, the waiter smiles and leaves. Jamie hadn’t noticed the waiter's expression and reaches for the petals of the flower. Wendy does it every time, plucking petals; go in, don’t go in. Leaning against the wall of the box, she reaches for one petal and pulls it. But before she could start counting, a shadow appears in front of her. “Little Jamie Moore? Why are you standing here? Did you come to see your husband?” Jamie Moore subconsciously looked up and saw Bruce Hill's smiling face.
	“Yes”. She snorted as she threw the petals in his face. “But why are you standing here? Are you coming in with me?” Bruce Hill didn't care about her behavior, because since young when Jamie Moore was in a bad mood, she would squat down to grab some mud to throw it at his face. She throws the flowers at him, and he surprisingly gets an impulse to cry out for such merciful kindness. Right after, Bruce Hill grabs Jamie Moore’s hand, and pulls her towards the private room, allowing no explanation.
	“Hey, it’s not.…...I’m not ready yet!”
	She can’t help it anyway, and she’s not ready to go in. Before she can get herself ready, she finds herself in the private room that is bustling with people and full of laughter. As Bruce Hill goes in, the eyes of a few people fall on him. They start teasing him, saying that he is late for the fine wine, while also letting him go to sit quickly.
	With one glance, Jamie Moore sees Dan William sitting on a sofa, casually holding a glass of wine. The rotating lights in the private room occasionally fall on him, making his facial features even more profound and charming. Anyone would be able to feel the air of keeping-every-creature-away coming out of him. Dan William seems to feel her eyes on him and moves his gaze to where she is standing. He then dimly moves his gaze away, as if he has not seen her standing there at all.
	Jamie Moore knows that he is in a bad mood. As soon as she finishes that thought, she feels shivers all over her body. She looks back and doesn't notice the man who is staring at her right hand. “Oh, the girlfriend has been changed again. Today, this girl is even more beautiful than model stars. Where did you find her? When will you give her to me for some fun time?” The person who was talking was Colton Lewis, a typical playboy.
	Most of the people in the private room were men, and now their greedy eyes were on Jamie Moore. I have to say, this woman is exceedingly beautiful. Although the white dress she is wearing is quite simple, the unique design makes it seem as if the dress was made only for her. The upper body quality is just perfect. The color white suits her and makes her look even more beautiful.
	It makes people want to look at her, while at the same time making her worry that they will offend her. Without a trace of shyness, she starts to chat with others before raising her chin and indifferently treading the waters. After hearing everything, Bruce Hill lets out a hiss. He looks in Dan William's direction, and even though he couldn't see his expression, he knew him. They grew up together, and he was sure that the cold and dangerous air was coming from him.
	Immediately letting go of Jamie Moore’s hand, he glares at Colton Lewis. “She is not my girlfriend”.
	"No? then I have a chance, beauty. How much for one night?" Colton Lewis whistles, his eyes full of hot desire, making her feel disgusted.
	Jamie Moore frowns. She was so very uncomfortable, and if she could, she would smash a glass on the table. But no, she came to admit her mistake today, not to make a scene.
Chapter 357: The Taste is so Low
	It was like being watched by a pig! Others might not have, but Jamie Moore tolerates it. Bruce Hills face sinks at the sight of Dan William’s facial expression. There were faint cracks in his glass wine, and the thought that it was over, hit him. Before Bruce Hill could comprehend what is happening, Dan William was grabbing a bottle and smashing it on Colton Lewis’s leg. He had moved so fast, that everyone stood shocked and dumbfounded.
	Colton Lewis, in particular, was beyond shocked. “Young master William, you are…”.
	Bruce Hill rolls his eyes at his stupidity. “Colton Lewis, do you even know who she is that you dare to spew such nonsense?”
	In his heart, Colton Lewis has a bad feeling. “Who…is she?”
	“Brother, you decide how to deal with this. Whatever you say, I’ll do it.” Bruce Hill pays no attention to Colton Lewis, instead, his eyes are on Dan William. Besides immediate punishment, he requires nothing else. Dan William's eyes find Bruce Hill's. His eyes don’t show much emotion, but the coldness in them makes Bruce Hill shiver. "It was too easy just now". He said, referring to the previous moment when he smashed the bottle on Colton Lewis 's leg.
	Bruce Hill's playful expression was returning to his face but was stopped with one look from Dan William. “Colton Lewis, right?” Dan William asks as he slowly walks over to him. He doesn’t pause when he walks pass Jamie Moore. Colton Lewis looks up at Dan William in astonishment. He quickly stands up and looks at Dan William with excitement on his face.
	“Yes, Yes Young Master William. I’m Colton Lewis”. He had not expected that Dan William would talk to him. In his mind, being at the party was enough to honor him. This could be the turning point. Dan William lifts his lips, his gaze stern and piercingly cold. His body seems to send forth a noble momentum that makes people want to surrender.
	His eyes landed on the people in the private room. “When did you all get such low taste?” With just one word, it felt like everyone’s heart was suddenly deposited on a cliff. It was very obvious what he had meant. “We didn’t invite him. It was him who followed us”, the man sitting next to Colton Lewis explains.
	With his hand resting on his eyebrow, Dan William's eyes become colder. As he looks into Colton Lewis 's eyes, he raises his leg and steps on his feet. With little effort, Colton Lewis’s face drains of color, almost making him look like a pig’s liver.
	“Derek William, pull him up and cripple his hands. Then expel him”.
	As soon as the words leave his mouth, the faces of everyone present changes as if they had just eaten a handful of flies. A coldness of some sort rose in the air. “No, Young Master William. I’m sorry, I will never again dare. Please, young Master William, give me another chance”.
	Colton Lewis was so scared that he almost felt paralyzed. He wanted to rush towards Dan William's legs but was kicked away by Derek William. After being dragged away by him, people could see a wet stain on the high-grade cashmere carpet. Jamie Moore pursed her lips and wanted to laugh. He peed his pants; does that still make him a man?
	She turns her gaze towards Dan William, who was already sitting on the sofa. A sense of joy fills her heart. The reason behind Dan William punishing Colton Lewis, was her? On the surface, it looks like he doesn’t want her. But his body was very honest. A small chuckle spills from her mouth. But upon realizing the dangerous gaze on her, her smile disappears.
	After Colton Lewis’s scene just now, people’s attentions were occupied somewhere else. Everyone present was familiar with Dan William, and the previous scene was the fault of Colton Lewis. Now, everyone was just having fun. Looking at the rose in her hand, Jamie Moore wants to walk towards Dan William. At this time, someone kindly reminds her, “Beautiful little sister, there are people over there that you probably shouldn’t provoke.
	Don’t overdo it. How about having a drink with a brother?” Bruce Hill takes a puff from his cigarette. It turns out that people still don’t know why Dan William lost his temper, and go as far as running into the muzzle of a gun? The people don’t realize that Dan William was angry because Colton Lewis had been too vulgar. Who would have thought that the girl who looks like a college student, was actually the wife of Dan William? The light in the private room was a bit dim, so it was no wonder.
	Besides, the dress she was wearing today was quite different than the one she had worn at Wendy's birthday party. She was young, and it would be difficult for anyone to see the woman in the small white dress as someone who bears an elegant family name. Jamie Moore looked at the seats in the private room.
	It seems like Duke Field hadn't come to the party. Duke Field might be busy pestering Wendy, which was probably why he hadn't come. “Oh? How do you know he will refuse me? I’m just going to see how he is, how about that?”
	Jamie Moore could see that there was still a great distance between where she was and Dan William’s position. There was music playing in the private room, making unworried about finding her way to him. He seems to have never thought she would say something like this. Raising his head, he carefully looks at her. One side of her was shadowed, while the other was beautifully outlined.
	But who was Dan William? Who doesn't realize that he already has a wife and that the affection between them still existed? He dotes on his wife, so how could he take a liking to other women? Even more, the woman can’t help herself being arrogant. “This woman, this young master is kind enough to advise you.
	Why don’t you know what’s good and bad? Do you want to claim connections to Dan William? He doesn’t think it’s worth it.” Jamie Moore was silent for a few seconds, before giving him a look. Bruce Hill smiled bitterly. How could he be pulled again by this female devil? “If it is going to be like this, do you want to make a bet with me?” Jamie asked, her eyebrows raised, and eyes filled with confidence.
	“Tell me.”
	“If I can get close to him, I win. If not, then you win. How about that?”
	“What kind of bet is this?” he thought, before immediately rejecting the bet.
	But then Bruce Hill came over while pretending to be interested. “How about you two add some bargaining chips? That will be fun”. For a moment, the man seems to be in deep thought, but then something flashes in his eyes. “Are you sure you want to make to bet with me?" he asks Jamie Moore as he looks at her. Jamie Moore nodded. “Well, then increase the bargaining chip.
	If you can get close to Dan William and kiss him, then you win. If you fail, then you lose. If you lose…,” the man said before pausing for a moment. He looked again at Jamie Moore, “I don’t think you have any money. So, if you lose, you will spend the night with me, how about that?”
Chapter 358: Involving the Irrelative
	How dare he say such things! Bruce Hills' eyes fall on the man. Jamie Moore’s plan was almost finished, so he should maybe take a step back, so he doesn’t involve the irrelative.
	Jamie Moore’s look is tangled as she bites her lip. Unease and hesitation fill her eyes. The man sees this, which makes Jamie Moore timidly shrink back. Finally, with hesitation marring her face, Jamie Moore decides to press her luck. “If I win, what bargaining chip will you give me?”
	“Yes, you can take out the equivalent, and make the bargaining chip. I’ll be a witness”.
	Under Jamie Moore’s threatening glance, Bruce Hill is forced to step forward and help her speak. He immediately bows his head until it is on the same level as the man’s ear. “This girl is good, if your bargaining chip is low, we will despise you”. The people around them are in high spirits as they watch the girl make a bet with him.
	Since they were in full view of everyone present, the man could not back down. He finally takes out his card and puts it on the table. "There are two million on this card. If you win, the two million is yours". Jamie’s lips twitch. Her purpose had been achieved. It was like catching a white wolf with bare hands. As long as she gets close to Dan William without any efforts, she will get the two million.
	“Alright, deal”. At this moment, there is a sudden trace of fear and hesitation on her face. She purses her pink lips and calmly walks towards Dan William. That person lets out a scornful laugh as if he is waiting for her to die. Should she go so far as to approach Dan William? Looking at Jamie Moore’s graceful back, the man can’t help the itch he feels. Deep inside, he has already decided that Jamie Moore will lose.
	Even though the place where Dan William was sitting is still a bit far, she can hear the words that were being spoken. From the moment she had come in, his eyes followed her carelessly. Even though he was angry at her for deceiving him, he still didn’t let her be insulted and slandered by others. Thinking of what Colton Lewis had said, Dan William still thought that crippling his hands had been a light punishment. For a moment, Jamie Moore hesitates, but then she walks towards Dan William.
	She had come to admit her mistake, and fleeing was not her style. As she stands in front of Dan William, she bites her lip before handing the rose in her hand to him. She looks at him with a pair of watery eyes, her voice soft and full of flatter.
	“Dan William, my name is Jamie Moore. I’m a girl of twenty-three, and my interest is you. I don’t have any bad habits; do want to consider accepting me?”
	As soon as the words came out, everyone present was petrified except Dan William. She was a girl, and her interest was Dan William? Girl, are you sure about that? With her words, and the brightness in her eyes, all the anger surrounding Dan William slowly dissipated and was followed by a smile. Seeing him smile, Jamie Moore realized that it wasn’t because he was in a bad mood.
	Relieved, she hands the rose to him. And then some more startling happens. Instead of kicking her away, Dan William stretches out his hand and accepts the rose. The eyes of the man who had made a bet with Jamie Moore widened as if he had just witnessed a terrible thing. How could this happen? Isn't Dan William supposed to push this woman away and then kick her out? How, how is this possible?
	The man tries to comfort himself by thinking that it didn’t matter. Dan William may look at her like this, but if she dared to kiss him, he would certainly punish her! For five years, Dan William had lived a clean and honest life. How could he leave his beloved at home and kiss an unknown girl?
	These people thought that Jamie Moore’s winning face wasn’t great, but they were looking forward to the mentality of watching the good play unfold. When Jamie Moore hands him the flowers, her fingertips accidentally brush his, sending an electric shock through her and making her blush.
	Dan William seems to notice the embarrassment on her face. He doesn’t take back his hand immediately. Instead, he takes the flower and rubs it gently on her tender and greasy hands. Jamie Moore’s blush deepens and she immediately pulls back her hand. She keeps scolding himself for being so immature. He only touched her hand and she was already blushing. What would happen next?
	She suddenly regretted the bet she made with that person. If she lost, she would lose face. In her heart, she kept cheering herself thus becoming even redder. Her eyes fall on Dan William’s pale pink thin lips, and she swallows down her saliva.
	She……what if she wants to nip at them? But, she wasn’t that kind of girl! Dan William didn’t know what the girl with the dense eyes and shallow smile was thinking, but he wouldn’t expose her. The man could see that Jamie Moore was still hesitating and sneered. He wanted to talk about ending the bet. But then he saw her sit on Dan William’s leg before putting her hands around his neck and her lips together.
	The man: ….….Girl, you really don’t want to live. Because this is Dan William. Jamie Moore was going to risk everything. She knew she had already reached the point of no return. That she would have to give the kiss of death to Dan William or spend the night with that playboy.
	This girl doesn't want to admit the effect this was taking on her heart. She wanted to have a taste of Dan William. Putting her arm around Dan William's neck, she pulled his down a little so that she could reach his lips.
	After gently kissing him on his lips, Jamie Moore knew she had won the bet. Feeling happy, she tried to stop the kiss. Dan William's black eyes narrow slightly. It is obvious that he is satisfied with how Jamie Moore had thrown herself in his arms. But she hadn't been here long and was already leaving.
	Does she want to leave? You wish!
	Not about to let her leave as she wanted, he stretches out his hand to hold her waist before pulling her closer to him. The lips that she was about to leave behind, were now tightly pressed on her own. Stunned, Jamie Moore opens her eyes and looks at the handsome man. She wants to say something, but no words leave her mouth.
	She puts her hand against Dan William’s chest and tries to push him away, but the man doesn’t move a bit. She was powerless against him. He could see that her attention was elsewhere, and his eyes flash. He punitively bites her lips, forcing her to open her mouth before attacking it.
Chapter 359: This is not Real!
	Those in the private room are now telling the truth. Some are red in the face…
	The person who bets with Jamie pinches himself in the leg and realizes that he did not make a mistake. That woman kissed Master William and not only did Master William not push her away, he….
	They directly hug and kiss?
	He is dizzy and wants to faint. Please tell him it isn’t real!
	Dan knows that she is shy and didn’t go a step further to tease her. He releases her and she buries her head into his chest. Her coy manner is simply too eye-catching.
	He looks around and sees them looking at the woman in his embrace.
	They could feel Dan’s bone-chilling stare and they turn away their gaze and act as if they didn’t see anything.
	Along with Dan’s stare, he gives off a soft humph, who dares to look at his woman?
	He looks down at the little girl, cute as an apple, in his embrace. His Adam’s apple shifts up and down. Then he carries her, stands up, and leaves.
	“Bro, Bro, this is Jamie’s winning chips.” When Bruce sees Dan about to leave with Jamie, he quickly takes up Jamie’s chips from the table to show Bruce.
	Dan calmly looks at the chips and then at them for a few seconds. Thereafter he looks at Jamie and asks, “Do you want them?”
	They were shocked. Master William asked for the woman’s opinion… It was clear that he dotes her but this is the first time they met, how could it…
	“Of course I want.” These are hard-earned by her. She almost died from not kissing Dan but that Dan would’ve kissed her to death. It is so embarrassing to let them see their public show of affection.
	When they are out of the private room, Dan places Jamie down. Those black and sparkling eyes are looking at her as if he is expecting something.
	When Jamie sees him looking at her, she starts to get anxious, bites her lower lip, and asks, “What do you want to say?”
	“Aren’t you the one who should say something to me?” Dan smirks and smiles at her.
	Jamie’s heart skips a beat. He knows… that she was lying that day?
	What now?
	The only way is to explain clearly.
	“I… the other day I didn’t lie to you intentionally.” Jamie’s voice is weak and says to him. She sees that his expression didn’t change and picks up her courage and continues, “The person who was with me wasn’t Ryan. I lied because that person was…”
	She looks around cautiously to check that no one is around, leans to his ear, and says her brother’s name. She believes him but she cannot brazenly tell him.
	Dan is shocked when he hears the name. The person who made her lie was her brother?
	Very soon, he understands where the problem is. Chris came to C country secretly and no one could know that. That is why Jamie is so careful to conceal it.
	“Then who was that man today?” His expression is much better compared to that a moment ago.
	“Which man?” Jamie didn’t understand and asks in return.
	“The man who had his arms around your shoulders at the airport.” Dan asks directly without hesitation.
	The man who had his arms around her shoulders?
	Jamie squints her eyes and pause for a second and thinks of a person, her brother!
	“That’s him!” Jamie looks into his eyes indicating that the person was Chris.
	Dan is surprised and uneasy, he clears his throat and says, “So what if he’s your brother, how can he be so intimate with you? What if others see you both?”
	Isn’t it normal for a brother to hug his sister?
	Jamie doesn’t want to explain any further but then she feels that something is not right.
	“Didn’t you take this morning’s eight-thirty flight? Then how do you know about his putting his arms on my shoulder?” Jamie looks at him. Secretary Sam told her that it was the eight-thirty flight. How did he see her and her brother?
	Unless… he didn’t leave and was there all along!
	No wonder these few days he was so cold towards her. He was actually jealous of her brother.
	Dan lowers his glance and says with an innocent face, “Let’s go.” And walks off.
	“Can’t you admit that you’re jealous?” Jamie says softly and the skips along towards him.
	The black Maybach moves steadily along the road. Jamie and Dan are at the rear passenger seats. There is a glass panel that separates the front and back compartments. The front cannot hear what happens behind.
	“Why is he here?” Dan asks suddenly.
	Jamie looks out of the window at the scenery when he asked, “Ah?” before she realizes, “Apparently Jack has something planned, he was worried and came over.”
	Hang on…
	It seems like she forgot something important. What is it?
	“Have you found that thing?” Dan looks over at Jamie. Jamie seems troubled, occasionally biting her lips, she looks so adorable.
	He means the thing that Jamie is searching for, the Myth Ring.
	Jamie shakes her head, “Not yet. But I keep feeling that that thing is near to me but no matter how I search I am unable to find it.”
	Dan’s eyes light up and laugh, “You have never suspected the person beside you?”
	“Person beside me? But no one else knows about this.” Jamie still didn’t understand what he means. Apart from her, Bunny and Dan, no one else knows about it.
	So how can she susp…
	Hang on, Bunny?
	Can it be that Bunny already found it?
	Jamie suddenly remembers. The people who appeared around Bunny were the Nights. As far as she knew, her grandfather adopted a name and the ring represents the authority of the Gilbert family. When they were in England, she didn’t see these people with Bunny and how is it that now when they are back in the country, these people have suddenly appeared.
Chapter 360: Actually Keeping it from Her!
	One possibility is, the ring was already found by Bunny and Night. 1 and others are the powers of the ring!
	This rascal has been keeping such an important incident from her?
	If Dan didn’t remind her, she wouldn’t have suspected Night. 1 and Night. 7. The last time she did wonder why their last name was Night but who knew that they were actually from the Gilbert family.
	She is simply too careless.
	When he sees Jamie gnashing her teeth and squirming restlessly, Dan laughs even heartier. He stretches out to rub her hair, “Why, have you figured it out?”
	Jamie turns her head slowly and looks at Dan’s gentle smile, she tests by asking, “Dan, have you known this all along?”
	She finally realizes. They all knew except her!
	Jamie bites her teeth and dives onto Dan. She bites down on his neck violently like a vicious cat, “You knew all along! Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
	She was needlessly worried for how long?!
	Dan gently sighs, he didn’t know that she can be so vicious to dive over and bite him. She is as good as an angry cat.
	His chin is on the top of her head. Although it doesn’t hurt when she bites his neck, this kind of seduction is testing Dan’s self-control.
	“You have yourself to blame for being stupid. It’s so obvious and you only figure it out now.” Dan’s voice was mellow and sexy.
	Jamie purses her lips and reluctantly lets go of his neck. When she sees the deep imprint of the teeth marks, she feels guilty and asks, “Was it painful?”
	Dan pulls her into his embrace, her cheeks slammed onto his chest, Jamie clenches her teeth.
	“Do you want to try?” Dan hooks his smile and says into her ear.
	As soon as she says, Jamie feels her neck being bitten, though it wasn’t painful, it was ticklish.
	“Are you a dog?” She blushes and her face turns red.
	“I was infected because of you.”
	“…”
	—
	Chris left after sending Jamie to the Star. He drives the company car to a place and stops. The interior of the car was dark.
	After a while, the door opens and a person gets into the car.
	“Chris.” A woman's voice says with much restrain. The woman sits beside Chris.
	Chris turns his head in and looks over. “It’s been so long, it must be difficult for you.” Chris’s voice was calm and collected.
	“It’s better that you bring me back.” Her voice was playful, sweet. Although he couldn’t see her face properly, he already guessed their expression.
	“Soon, I promise you. Once this issue is resolved, I’ll take you back. “ Chris promised.
	Those words were tender and reassuring.
	The woman looks at the man, her heart is conflicted. She wants to get nearer but she didn’t dare.
	She must be contented that she can look at him that way.
	How can she expect that he likes her?
	With one sentence from him, she feels that all the years of perseverance was worth it.
	“Oh yes, thank you.” Chris removes his sunglasses, turns, and looks at her. She wasn’t sure if she was mistaken but she could sense a hint of tenderness.
	“July.”
	The lights from the passing cars shone on the car windows and lighted the flawless complexion of the woman. Though the lights are brief, it was enough to see the entire face.
	She was the CR group’s most famous model, July Summers.
	July has never felt this way before. It’s like a feather gently gliding over her skin, ticklish and itchy.
	Sweeping away all her struggle of years for CR trying to get close to Dan and the others.
	With his single thanks, she gets so contend.
	July’s hands tighten. She calms down and takes a deep breath and starts to report to Chris, “Till now, only one person finds that my identity is doubtful. But thankfully she was not able to find out anything. Coupled with I don’t appear often and do things in a low profile manner. No one discovered me.”
	“Who?” Chris looks at her curiously. The changes to July’s identity were done by him, who else could detect it?
	He is now even more curious.
	July purses her lips and says, “Dan, Jamie’s husband.”
	What July couldn’t understand was he obviously found out about her identity and did nothing. No questioning, he didn’t send anyone to follow her. As if everything were in his control.
	This type of person is the most frightening.
	Good thing is that they are their people and won’t get into a big incident.
	“Him.” Chris raised his eyebrow and laughs, “My sister has good taste.”
	“… your sister has already married, Chris, have you no thoughts about this?”
	“Continue with the report.”
	Chris interrupted her and his gaze wandered off.
	July was shocked but continues to report, “I once told Jamie that I was sent here by you but Jamie wouldn’t believe.”
	“Why?” Chris frowns. With the family insignia as evidence, Jamie should believe July.
	That thing represents the identity of the Lockwood family.
Chapter 361: What’s the Matter?
	The reason was July has…
	July lowers her head, and says with guilt and apologetically, “The clan insignia… I lost it accidentally…”
	The car was quiet for a moment.
	Chris didn’t speak, his sheer beauty and smile is hiden so deep that it’s difficult to read.
	“Lost it?” He asks surprisingly.
	July understands that he is angry. She grew up with him and is fully aware of his mood changes.
	“I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose…” She quickly explains but is cut off by Chris.
	“Get out.”
	“Chris…” July looks at him in surprise and hurt but it was dark in the car and Chris didn’t notice.
	The atmosphere is thick, July bites her lips and laughs bitterly, she knows that he will not easily take back what he said. She didn’t say anything else, picks up her bag, “Then… I’ll leave now.”
	She opens the door and steps out.
	When the car door closed, July hears Chris’ voice.
	“Drive.”
	The car drives away leaving a shape that disappears into the night.
	“Chris you idiot! Idiot!” July stomps on the ground angrily as she sees the car driving away from that place. She removes her gloves and throws them away.
	The gloves are light and didn’t get far. They drop onto the ground near her.
	She feels better after scolding him, it is rather remote here. She took a taxi there and her car is still in the parking garage at CR.
	As soon as she received his call, she postponed an advertisement which she was scheduled to produce. It’s only an insignia, why is he so upset?
	The family insignia is just a token of the family identity but why must Chris get so angry…
	She is upset and squats down and stares at the ground in a daze.
	Don’t you know that I’ve liked you for so long? She waits for a passing car.
	She is losing her body heat rapidly, what she is wearing is supposed to be for the advertisement recording and is thin and unable to keep out the cold winds.
	A person loses confidence easily when he is depressed. That is what July is feeling now.
	She buries her head between her knees and feels dead within her.
	Just at this moment, the car that drove away turns around and stops next to July, the headlights shining onto her.
	She lifts her head to look and it was as if fireworks are going off in her heart. She is flustered.
	“Miss Summer, please get in the car.” Maris sticks out his head and says.
	July walks to the car without any hesitation but Chris was not in the car.
	“Maris, where is he?” July enters the warm car, her cold body trembles uncontrollably.
	“Chris drove away in another car.” Maris explains but didn’t say any more.
	July didn’t ask further, she feels warm and happy inside.
	At least he… isn’t that heartless towards her.
	…
	Jamie didn’t expect July to look for her after the last time they spoke.
	At this moment, Jamie realizes that she had forgotten something.
	She forgot to ask Chris who did he send over to help her…
	They sat at the café below CR and Jamie had a note pad with her.
	Inspiration comes from life and Jamie is frustrated when there isn’t any.
	“What do you want with me?” Jamie sits opposite to July as she removes her sunglasses which reveal her tired eyes and heavy makeup to cover the eyebags.
	“You… did you rob a bank last night?” Jamie smirks and sips her juice.
	July looks as if she had a difficult night. Jamie has never seen her in this haggard state.
	Every time she sees July, she would be in a very elegant gown, delicate makeup, and Chanel No.5 perfume, but today…
	She is wearing casual attire, didn’t wear perfume. Although she had heavy makeup on, it was far from her elegant image.
	“Yes, I was so busy these few days that I hardly slept…” July rubbed her eyebrows tiredly. She was so haggard that it’s hardly recognizable that she is that famous model, July.
	“I’m here to ask you that these few days can you contact…” July used French to say the name and Jamie hear it very clearly.
Chapter 362: My Dearest Cousin
	Jamie squints her eyes and looks at the haggard July with the meaning, “What do you mean?”
	She pretended not to understand.
	Because now the insignia is with Jozo, and July actually knows her brother’s name.
	Now she doesn’t believe either woman unless her brother tells her. Before that, she will not believe anyone.
	“You don’t have to be so defensive. I just met him the other day.” July sighs softly and helplessly.
	But since then, Chris has not contacted her. She can’t get through to his cell phone and can’t find him. She knows it’s because of the insignia.
	“Oh.” Jamie says as she bites on the straw and looks at her.
	“… All I did was accidentally losing the insignia, can’t you believe me for once?” July leans forward and begs Jamie, her eyes waiting for a reaction.
	“All you did was losing the insignia?” Jamie places her glass down. She coldly repeats with a chilly stare, “Let’s say it was you, is that the way you regard the insignia? In your eyes, it is an insignificant thing?”
	July purses her lips and curiously looks at her, “Isn’t it?”
	“I can’t help you if you think of it that way.” Jamie laughs coldly, her attitude suddenly changes. Even her eyes show how upset she is.
	She doesn’t like it when others treat it that way. Even if July was sent by her brother.
	Only the direct members of the Lockwood family can receive the family insignia to represent their identity and status. She, Bunny and Chris have it. If they get married or marry anyone, that person will also become a part of the Lockwood family and receive the insignia.
	It also represents acceptance into the family.
	If July has the insignia, then is also a sign that she has been accepted by the Lockwood family. How could she even say those words?
	“I can tell you that if you lose that thing, it means that you are no longer accepted by the Lockwood family, and not part of the family.” Jamie couldn’t bear to see her hurt and calmly explains.
	The Lockwood family insignia was handed down from a long time ago. The significance is extraordinary, especially for the Patriarch of the family who highly regards anyone with the insignia.
	What?
	July’s eyes open widely and look at Jamie in disbelief.
	The insignia… actually has these meanings?
	At that time when Patriarch Lockwood gave her the insignia, was that a sign that she had been accepted into the family?
	But she always thought that it was something which represented the Lockwood family and enable Jamie to believe her identity.
	No wonder Chris was so upset when he knew about her losing the insignia.
	“I’ve other things to attend to and need to leave.” Jamie has said what she needed to. She can’t tell July where Chris is. She stands up and left.
	When she walks outside the Café, Jamie turns her head and looks at July who is still at the table. She looks disappointed and remorseful and holds tightly to her cup of coffee.
	Jamie purses her lips and inexplicably starts to believe that July is that person.
	Then how did Jozo get hold of the insignia?
	Since she can’t figure it out, she decides not to think about it for now. Jamie holds on to her note pad and walks into the building towards the lift.
	Just at the corner, Jamie glances down to adjust her grip on her notepad and as soon as she raises her head, she bumps into a person.
	“Ah! Are you blind? You dare to walk into me!” A sharp voice yells and Jamie took a few steps back to stabilize herself.
	She rubs her ear due to the shrill voice and looks at the person.
	That person is Lisa, why is she here?
	When Lisa balances herself, she stares at Jamie angrily, seeing that Jamie was surprised, she continues.
	She coldly remarks and despises her. It was unlike the previous two times and she no longer tries to know her and doesn’t bother about her. She arrogantly lifts her head.
	“I was wondering who is the blind bat. It’s actually my beloved cousin.” Lisa brushes her clothes to clear off the imaginary dust.
	Jamie detects the sarcasm and slight and disregards it. She didn’t take it to heart.
	“I remembered that I once said that we don’t know each other well. Don’t have to address me as your cousin as if we are that close. You are beyond human, I’m not so out of the league.” She smirks and countered. Her watery eyes easily attract passersby.
	Beyond human?
	Lisa can speak the language of C country but doesn’t know much. She turns and asks her assistant, “What did she mean by beyond human?”
	The assistant is in an awkward spot. She sees Lisa’s questioning eyes and softly explains, “That means that you are a non-human creature, for example… a pig.”
	Pig?
	Lisa like to eat roast pig but she has never heard about using a pig to scold someone. But she knows that if Jamie says “Pig” at her, then it certainly isn’t a compliment.
	“I greeted you ‘cousin’ out of respect. Someone whose origins weren’t clear. Who knows if you are after the Lockwood family fortunes and impersonate as the youngest daughter? Lisa can’t match Jamie in scolding but she can certainly be sarcastic, thanks to her mother’s training.
	“Lisa, I’m not interested in your family fortune!” Jamie rolls her eyes, she doesn’t bother about how she looks and intends to walk towards the lift after finishing.
	“Has her head been crushed by the lift doors? Is she scolding me?” Lisa frowns and blocks Jamie’s path.
	Her strong smell of perfume chokes Jamie and she takes a few steps backward. She waves the air in front of her and pinches her nose.
	Does this Lisa know how to apply perfume? It seems like she poured the entire bottle of perfume on herself.
	Lisa sees her actions and smells her own odor. This is the hottest perfume sold at Moon and very difficult to get a hold of. Why does she seem to hate its smell?
	Unless…
	Lisa’s expression is sinister and she walks towards Jamie. True enough as she gets near to her, Jamie couldn’t resist and backs off while pinching her nose.
Chapter 363: Jamie is Allergic to Perfume
	Jamie’s complexion is fair and tender. In addition to being allergic to perfume, whenever she smells a concentrated smell of perfume, she will have an allergic response. For example the other time at Moon’s perfume R&D facility. She was barely inside for fifteen minutes and she broke out in rashes.
	The perfume on Lisa’s body wasn’t that concentrated and is diffused by the wind. But it started to cause Jamie’s hands to break out in red spots.
	Lisa started to smile: Jamie is allergic to perfume.
	No wonder in the two times that they met, she didn’t detect any perfume on her.
	Very quickly she has a thought. Lisa didn’t back off but suddenly rushes forward to hug Jamie. Jamie is pinching her nose and couldn’t react in time. She releases her hand and the perfume fumes rush into her nose.
	The smell is so intense that she almost faints.
	The assistant by her side is shocked to see what just happened. Wasn’t she despising Jamie a moment ago? Why is Lisa hugging her now?
	“Cousin, I’m here all alone and don’t know anyone else. I’m so happy to see you!” Lisa hugs Jamie tightly and says as CR’s staff walk by.
	Jamie didn’t expect Lisa to be so shameless to hug her! The smell on her body is killing her!
	“Get off me!” Jamie shouts angrily, she can detect the thick fumes of the perfume and pinches her nose again. She frowns deeply.
	The red spots are forming on her exposed skin.
	“Sister, what did you say? I can’t hear!” Lisa continues to hug her, she is laughing inside and wants to ruin her cheeks. He doesn’t believe that Dan will still want her when that happens.
	“Didn’t you hear her asking you to release your grip?” A familiar voice roars out. Jamie turns and sees Dan walking towards her.
	Dan is stern and cold, staring at Lisa who continues to hug Jamie. He grabs Lisa’s hand and forcibly pulls it off Jamie.
	Crackle.
	The sound of bones cracking filled the quiet walkway.
	“Ah…Argh…” Lisa's hand was in pain and releases Jamie. She bends over and screams in pain.
	Dan smiles and appears a gentleman but his moves are deadly and ruthless.
	Not only did he not let go of her hand, but he also continues to bend her fingers backward with increasing force. Lisa’s fingers appear like they’ll break off at any moment.
	The assistant is shocked and stands helplessly on one side, not daring to interfere. Lisa looks at him seeking help and he can’t pretend that he didn’t see her.
	Furthermore, Lisa is the daughter of their Vice President. If anything happens to her, the person who will be punished will be a lowly worker like him.
	“Sir, can you please, please release your hand. We are here today to discuss how we will collaborate. What you are doing will harm the two companies and the …” The assistant musters all his courage to complete the sentence but he didn’t dare to look at Dan directly in his eyes.
	“Collaborate?” Dan says calmly, “From today onwards, CR and Moon will cease all forms of cooperation, present, and future.”
	What? The assistant was stunned. He didn’t expect things to turn out this way. They had already signed the contract, if the contract is not honored, then the compensation…
	“I will have someone transfer the compensation amount to your company’s account. Now, please leave CR.” Dan’s expression changes and he releases Lisa’s hand. Then he takes out a napkin from his suit and cleans his fingers.
	Lisa’s expression goes completely pale. Her hand was practically broken and throbs painfully. The pain shoots directly to the heart.
	The assistant didn’t dare to stay a minute longer and was afraid that Dan’s fury will turn onto him. He holds tightly to Lisa and leads her out of CR towers.
	Jamie continues to scratch the red spots on her hands, neck, and face. But she knows enough not to scratch her face too forcefully.
	“Don’t scratch.” Dan grabs both of her hands and they walk towards the lift.
	The lift reaches the Director’s level and they exit the lift.
	“Dan, release my hands, I won’t scratch.” Jamie’s entire body is starting to itch like a million bugs crawling all over her. She wants to scratch but she can’t move her hands because Dan is holding on tightly to them.
	She couldn’t endure any longer and presses her face onto Dan’s chest trying to ease the itch.
	But it isn’t a good solution.
	Dan sighs and didn’t release his grasp. When in his office, he makes her sit on the bed.
	“Don’t move, I’ll go and get the medicine.” He softly says. Thereafter he went to the medicine cabinet to look for a suitable ointment.
	After he saw Jamie’s allergic reaction to perfume, he prepared these medicine and kept them in the car and the office. Even if he had forbidden the CR staff to wear perfume, some still do. In anticipation of such events, he prepared a lot of medicine and ointment.
	Once Jamie sees him turn around, she started scratching. It was so itchy that she wanted to tear her skin right off.
	Every second was torture and her scratching is getting more and more forceful. Her skin is starting to have bloody marks.
	“Brother, where are you?” Suddenly someone opens the door and comes into the room. He didn’t find Dan and walks towards the bedroom without hesitation.
	“Brother! What happened to the cooperation with Moon…” The voice suddenly stops, Jamie looks up in frustration and sees Bruce at the door.
	Dan walks over with the ointment and looks at Bruce calmly. Then he walks over to Jamie and frowns. He grabs Jamie’s hands and sees blood marks all over her hands.
Chapter 364: Take off the Clothes
	"Do you want to die?" Dan scolds coldly and gives her a hard flick on her forehead.
	Jamie cries in pain, pouts, and looks anxiously at the red marks on her hands.
	"Brother, what is going on?" Bruce asks incredulously as he moves over to see the red spots and blood on Jamie's hands and face.
	"If you are here to ask why I cancel the contract with Moon, this is the answer." As Dan sits down with his legs bent and rolls up Jamie's sleeve, he sees that her fair skin is covered with red spots, so is her other arm.
	Bruce nods and asks no more questions, because compared with Jamie, no matter how insignificant the matter is, it would become trivial.
	He leaves the lounge and closes the door for them.
	"Dan, I feel bad." Jamie frowns, looking at the red dots on it. The skin where there were no problems suddenly feels itchy.
	"Go and wash it, and then apply ointment." Dan looks at the red dots on her arm and face for a moment, then picks her up and walks to the bathroom.
	The place where he has spent most of the time in for the past five years is the company.
	Because only by devoting himself to his work can he temporarily forget her and not think about her.
	The lounge here is connected to his office. Sometimes, when he works late, he will not go back to the manor, but to rest here. Therefore, there is not only a bathroom in his lounge, but also a small kitchen.
	He has never used the kitchen. If he is hungry, he usually asks his secretary to buy takeout.
	The bathroom is clean and tidy with bright lights.
	Dan puts her in the bathtub, takes the shower above, presses the switch and adjusts the temperature and then says to her, "Take off your clothes."
	Jamie is scratching her arms secretly. When she hears his words, she looks up at him and swallows her saliva subconsciously.
	"What... what did you say?"
	Dan frowns slightly and repeats again under her puzzled eyes, "Take off your clothes."
	Take off... the clothes?!
	Would you mind not saying these words in such a pure, noble and decent way? It will make her think she's impure.
	Jamie immediately grabs her collar tightly, looking at Dan’s eyes a little shy and her face turns reddish, "You are insane!"
	What? Insane?
	Hearing that, Dan chuckles at her, looking at her with a soft smile in his eyes, "Where haven't I kissed you? Why so shy?"
	Jamie's little face suddenly becomes as red as blood. Her lips tremble slightly, and she doesn't know what to say.
	She is totally defeated by his shamelessness!
	"I am not teasing you. Take it off quickly; otherwise how to wash it?" Dan says to her, puts down the shower in his hand, and then stretches out his hand to pull her clothes.
	"Wait a minute! I... I'll do it myself..." Jamie immediately grabs her clothes more tightly, and her little face is flushed. How could he not feel embarrassed? Can he feel bashful?
	"Do it yourself?" Dan stares at her, thinks for a moment while staring at the red dots on her face for a few seconds. Finally, he gives in. "I'll wait for you outside."
	Then he puts the shower on the place where she can get. And then he goes out of the bathroom.
	When did he become so kind?
	Jamie is relieved when she sees him go out and close the door. Even though she has already been seen by him, she still feels shameless. If she is stared at by him so bluntly, she is afraid that her face would get burned...
	After running the hot water and putting off her clothes on a nearby hanger, Jamie steps into the tub. Looking at the red spots on her body, she manages to look away. The water is hot and she slips into the tub, leaving only her head above the water.
	The hot water seems to comfort the discomfort on her skin. Jamie actually feels better.
	After washing, Jamie feels that it is just a psychological effect, because it is still itchy, but the hot water eases the pain.
	There are clean bathrobes on the hanger. Jamie looks at the bathrobes and takes one to put it on, because wearing a bathrobe will make it easier to wipe the medicine.
	After she dresses up, Dan is sitting by the bed staring at the screen of the mobile phone. When she comes out, he pats the position in front of him and motions her to take a seat.
	Jamie touches her tied hair. The end of her hair got wet. She puts her hand behind her neck and scratches it.
	She goes over to sit down and looks at Dan piteously.
	Dan gives her a helpless look, puts down his cell phone, takes the ointment next to him, smears it on his finger, picks up her hand, and spreads it over the red dots.
	The ointment is added with mint essence, which feels cool, and sooths Jamie’s discomfort feeling.
	As Jamie watches him apply the ointment on her body, she couldn't help reminding him that he has missed some places.
	However, Dr. Jim's medicine is very useful. All the places where the ointment has been smeared don't itch anymore. It's cool and feels very comfortable.
	Dan plasters all the missing places as she says. He pays special attention to the scratched places, softening the force a lot, and blowing on it as he puts it on, so that she doesn't feel so painful.
	Jamie bites her lips as she looks down at him who is plastering medicine for her. His pink lips tilt uncontrollably, soft and sweet, as if they have been sweetened with honey.
	He is very focused and gently applies the ointment on her bogy. The drooping eyes look attentive, but the obvious softness of his face shows that he is very tender to her.
	The unique mint fragrance from him fills the room. Jamie feels calm when she smells it.
	The lounge is very quiet, the afterglow of the sunset is cast on the French windows. The golden color is like the honey.
	Jamie suddenly feels peaceful.
	However, the next second, she is keenly aware that the sleeve of the bathrobe has been pulled to the shoulder by Dan.
	Maybe because it is too difficult to apply the medicine, he simply pulls down the clothes on her shoulders, revealing her large shoulder skin.
	Fortunately, the central air-conditioning in the lounge is well heated, so Jamie doesn't feel cold, but she has some doubts about his behavior. She immediately puts her clothes up and looks at him with shame and annoyance.
	"What... what are you going to do?" Jamie's voice is stuttering. Looking at her serious face, he doesn't know what to say.
	"Take the medicine. Do you think I can do anything to you now?" His look is very calm, and he just glances at her like a gentleman. 
Chapter 365: I Warn You, Don't Touch Her
	This makes Jamie feel that what she thinks is impure. He is kind enough to put medicine for her, but she is still thinking too much about him.
	Jamie, it’s enough. Keep calm.
	"I... I can do it myself..." Jamie feels somewhat unnatural, and the calmer and more serious his eyes are, the more Jamie feels that her thoughts are impure, so it is difficult for her to calm down.
	"What are you nervous about?" Dan peers at her, then moves closer to her, breathing warm air on her face, and looking at her with his eyebrows raised.
	"Nervous? Who is nervous? I have hands, and I can do it myself." Jamie immediately denies what he says and stutters. She couldn't help despising herself in her heart. What the hell is she ashamed of?
	Keep calm! Keep calm! Keep calm!
	The more she thinks, the less Jamie can calm down.
	A smile passes in Dan's eyes, and his eyes become more and more treacherous.
	He steps back and hands her the ointment without saying anything. "Well, there you go."
	It's the second time he’s been so accommodating...
	Jamie sighs in her heart, and always feels that something is wrong. In the old days, Dan would have just stripped her down and applies the ointment. How can he be so nice today?
	Did the sun rise in a west?
	Jamie immediately takes the ointment, for fear that he would go back on his word. She stretches out her hand and puts some ointment on her shoulder.
	Dan leans against the wall and looks at her slowly applying the ointment.
	When she is done with her shoulders Jamie will go down.
	But...
	Jamie is blushing again. She just stops and not knowing whether she should apply the medicine down her shoulders. "Could you mind turning around?"
	Dan raises his eyebrows and looks at her with some displeasure. "I'll help you if you talk more nonsense."
	Jamie purses her pink lips, blinks her eyes, then unexpectedly turns her back on Dan to apply the medicine.
	Dan looks at the little woman with her back to him in amazement, hooks his lips and smiles. She is smart, instead of letting him turn around, she turns around herself.
	After finishing the abdomen, Jamie stops again.
	She finds that she is wearing bathrobe. If she wants to apply her legs and other places, she has to...
	Can she do this in the bathroom?
	Jamie turns around and watches Dan with watery eyes, only to find that a trace of pride flashes his face, so fast that she thinks it’s her illusion.
	Because his expression clearly means "I'll rip you off if you don't hurry up". If she dares to let him turn around or let him go out, she won't get out of this place today...
	"You look at me like this... so do you want me to apply the medicine for you?" Dan hooks his lips and shows his enchanting smile. His big hand takes the ointment from her hand, throws it precisely into the trash bin, and then takes a new one.
	"I..." Jamie is in a daze. When did she say she wants him to apply the medicine for her?
	"Well, I have met your wishes, but you don't have to look at me so gratefully." Dan smiles deeper and pulls her clothes down.
	Hey! She is not grateful.
	Jamie is pushed down, staring at him with a pair of water eyes, feeling angry but she doesn’t how to vent her anger.
	Dan, can he be more shameless?
	After coming out of CR, Lisa is taken to the hospital by her assistant, and she is getting her bones set and cast. The doctor suggests that she should be hospitalized.
	Lisa has always lived with her mother, Iriya, and her father is the live-in son-in-law of the Lockwood family, so she takes her mother's last name. Her father died shortly after she was born, so Lisa has little knowledge of her father.
	Lisa has been living with Iriya, and she is favored in the Lockwood family. She has been pampered and willful since she was a child, and she has never suffered anything, let alone her wrist is broken like this.
	When setting the bones, she passes out with pain directly, and she hasn't woken up yet.
	The corridor outside the VIP ward is quiet and clean, and almost no one passes by.
	"That man is really bold and dares to beat my daughter." with her arms folded in front of her chest, Iriya stands in front of a huge glass window, looking at Lisa lying on the bed inside. Her eyes, which look like Lisa's, are full of anger.
	Ryan leans against the wall and doesn’t agree with Iriya. "I advise you not to underestimate him, at least in country C, no one dares to move him."
	His voice is very light, but with a touch of coldness.
	Iriya looks at Ryan. There is no trace of the years left on the face that has been maintained all the year round, but it has the charm of a mature woman. "I believe that Mr. Ryan definitely has this ability to deal with him."
	"Of course, but the premise is that he is not in country C." Ryan doesn't deny it.
	"So, as long as he is not in country C, you can get back at him for my daughter?"
	"It’s kidding, even if he isn’t in country C, it is still impossible." Ryan says lightly, looking at Iriya with some ridicule.
	If it is so easy to kill Dan, someone would have done it already.
	Iriya doesn't take his ridicule to heart. Her finger with red nail polish scratches across the window, leaving no trace. "I heard that he loves his wife very much, doesn't he?"
	Ryan's eyes get cold at once, and he shots a fierce glance at Iriya. "What do you want to do?"
	"What do you think?"
	"I warn you, don't touch her’ otherwise don't blame me for interrupting the cooperation."
	For a moment the atmosphere gets intense and silent. The four eyes stare at each other, bursting with fierce sparks.
	After a while, Ryan's eyes are too cold and sharp, and Iriya takes the lead in compromising. "Mr. Ryan, you are so excited. I will mistake your relationship."
	Ryan snorts, with his eyes still sharp.
	Iriya doesn't mention it again, but she couldn't suppress her anger in her heart. It is very uncomfortable to hold it in her heart.
	She takes out a USB from her handbag and hands it to Ryan. "The old man has already planned to pass on the family to Anthony. Mother wants to know your plan."
	"It’s not ready." Ryan takes the USB and looks at it, then holds it in his hand.
	"It’s not ready? When will you get ready?" Iriya is a bit angry and anxious.
	He is always not ready. Iriya has been tired of this!
	If they drag on, the whole Lockwood family will fall into Anthony’s hands sooner or later!
	"If you don't want to wait, you can interrupt the cooperation. I didn't force you." Ryan is getting impatient, and it seems that he doesn't want to continue talking. 
Chapter 366: Help Me
	Iriya is too angry to answer him back, so she says, "Don't forget that it’s you who came to us. When the Lockwood family falls into someone else's hands, you're not going to get anything!"
	"I see, just take your time."
	"It's best to do it as soon as possible." Iriya snorts, then pushes open the door of the ward and goes in.
	Ryan stares at the person in the ward for a moment, then turns and leaves.
	The mobile phone in his pocket suddenly vibrates a few times. He takes it out of his pocket and answers, "Hello?"
	"Oh, I feel so bad. It’s so bad, help... help me..." The familiar voice makes Ryan's pupil contract suddenly.
	He holds tightly the phone and trembles uncontrollably. It is a long time before he comes back to earth.
	"I know you are listening. What do you want to do?" He tries to calm himself down and asks calmly.
	The painful voice for help gradually drifts away, and a vicious voice rings on the other end of the phone.
	"You haven't made any progress for so long. Have you forgotten your identity?"
	"No, I always keep that in mind." He says word by word, he holds tighter the mobile phone. The sunshine and warmth in his eyes fade a little, leaving only endless gloom.
	"It’s best if you remember. I will give you another week, if you still don’t make any progress, well..."
	The last sound is especially highlighted, and harsh, with menace and sinister.
	Then the phone hangs up.
	Ryan doesn't look at the call screen. With a hard wrist, the phone is snapped by half. The fragment of the screen splinters into his palm, and the blood flows out.
	After a long time, he doesn't loosen the broken cell phone in his hand, but holds it tighter before leaving this place.
	It takes Jamie two days for the red spots to completely fade away, and finally she doesn't have to be pushed down by a certain shameless person to apply the medicine.
	However, Jamie still hasn't gotten in touch with Chris these days. He took her to the place where he lives now last time. At that time, the car deliberately made several turns in order to get rid of the people behind it, and it is night, so she didn't pay attention to the route.
	As a result, no one can find him unless he comes to her himself.
	July is looking for her very diligently but Jozo doesn't take any actions, as if she doesn't know Chris once came here at all.
	Jamie has already had some ideas in her heart. Maybe, just as July says, she lost her national emblem and Jozo happened to get it.
	Jamie is still puzzled by Jozo's ambiguous words that day.
	Who should she trust?
	She asks Dan about this question, but Dan says that July is more suspicious, but when she asks him why, he doesn't tell her, just let her guess herself.
	How can she guess?
	Jamie, who has been troubled by this problem, doesn’t want to think about it anymore and goes to "CR Street" with the research report given to her by the Vice Minister of Design Department last time.
	As the name implies, it is a street full of CR stores.
	Originally, she was going to ask Wendy to accompany her, but Wendy is busy dealing with the matter of Eddie, so she doesn't bother her.
	Jamie has completely forgotten Ryan's reminder that day and devotes herself to the clothing investigation of CR.
	She walks into the trade building and looks around, curious about it.
	This is her first time to come here, and she is curious about it.
	It is said that this street is built after Dan takes office, at the same time as CR changes its name.
	CR's former name is the William Group, and Dan changes its name as soon as he takes office. At that time, he was opposed by the company's top staff. What's more, some criticized that he doesn't focus on how to improve the company's performance, but to do some superficial things.
	But Dan is not crushed by these voices. Instead, he insists on changing its name. After that, as everyone can see, CR thrives. In the previous days, CR is mainly involved in the clothing industry.
	Since Dan takes office, the scope of CR has become wider. Although it is still mainly involved in clothing, it is engaged in jewelry, tourism, catering, tobacco and other industries. All these happened in just a few years.
	But these are created by Dan alone. He uses his own ability to change most of the industries in country C into his own properties, and becomes the legend of business circle.
	CR...
	Jamie looks at the "CR" sign in front of the counter at the main entrance on the first floor of the trade building. It’s shining with blue light with golden edge, restrained but noble, which makes people unable to forget it at first glance.
	Jamie has heard the words CR many times. Occasionally, she has seen these two words in the planning book or project case, but she has never been as touched as she is at the moment.
	She ponders on these two letters carefully, but it seems familiar to her.
	Suddenly, her eyes light up.
	She looks at the sign, and a touch of tenderness gradually emerges in her eyes. An indescribable warmth and touch sweep her.
	She seems to know what it means.
	She takes out her mobile phone, turns on her camera, and takes a picture of the sign.
	Looking at the picture, Jamie smiles with satisfaction. Then she finds out the contact person, edits the content, and sends the picture to Dan.
	After sending it out, her eyebrow eyes seem to be soaked with honey, sweet and soft.
	"Jamie, why are you here?" A soft voice sounds from behind Jamie. She turns around and sees Jozo in a wheelchair coming towards her.
	People around her cast curious and sympathetic looks at her, but she seems to be unaware of it. She comes to Jamie with gentle and face and very calm.
	Before she knows the truth, Jamie believes Jozo. When Jozo comes over, Jamie looks behind her, but she doesn't see Alma.
	"Are you alone? Where's Alma?"
	"Alma goes to buy me a drink. I don't want to go there, so I just wait for her here." Jozo says. Her eyes are friendly and kind, and there is no trace of guilty conscience.
	It is precisely because of this that Jamie is so entangled. It can only say that Jozo’s acting is too good.
	"How about we go and sit over there?" Jozo sees her staring at herself, without showing an impatient look, and points to a dessert shop not far away.
	There are many couples sitting in the dessert shop. Jamie and Jozo go in and find a window seat.
	Jamie doesn't speak, because there are so few topics between her and Jozo that she couldn't be stupid enough to test her with her brother's whereabouts, so she keeps silent.
	Jozo, as if she doesn't mind Jamie being unfamiliar with herself, orders a juice and then asks Jamie what to drink.
	"Just lemonade." Jamie says.
	"A cup of hot cocoa and a cup of lemon juice, thank you." Jozo says to the waiter, then turns to look at Jamie, "How can you go shopping alone? Where’s Dan?"
Chapter 367: It is Best Not to See Each Other Again
	"Well, there are some things to deal with, and he is busy today." Jamie is a little unaccustomed to her kind tone. She feels normal if Jozo is disagreeable.
	She doesn't lie. Dan is very busy today. He has an important meeting in the morning and has to pick up a foreign customer for dinner in the afternoon, so she comes here by herself.
	Jozo nods, not talking.
	The waiter comes over with the drinks they have just ordered. When he is about to put down the juice on the tray, somehow the waiter suddenly falls over Jamie.
	Fortunately, the waiter acts in time and turns his elbow, so only some of the juice is spilled on Jamie's clothes.
	Jamie is wearing a white double-breasted windbreaker today. It is fine if it is splashed with lemon juice, but it is ruined by the cup of hot cocoa.
	"I'm sorry, miss. Haven't been burned? Have you?" The waiter turns pale and quickly puts down his tray to see Jamie.
	Fortunately, Jamie is wearing thick clothes today, and has not been burned. It's just the marks on this dress are ugly.
	"What’s the matter with you? What if you burn her?" Jozo raises her eyebrows, pretends to scold the waiter, and then hands Jamie the paper on the table. "Deal with the stain."
	The waiter is wronged. The floor here is not slippery or flat. Just now, she didn't know what happened and she seemed to have been tripped by something and fell down, and then she spilled juice on Jamie.
	But there is no stone or raised place on the ground. How could she get tripped?
	Jamie frowns at her clothes dyed with hot cocoa color. She doesn't get burned, but it is a pity that her clothes get dirty. This dress is her favorite white dress.
	She smiles and shakes her head at the waiter's concerned and embarrassing eyes. "I didn't get burned. I just need to change a dress."
	"Yes, change it. There are clothing stores everywhere. Let's just buy one." Jozo breathes a sigh of relief, and then rolls her wheelchair to leave.
	Jamie doesn't refuse her. After all, this dress is really ugly with stain.
	"I will pay for your drinks. I am really sorry." Seeing that they don't blame him, the waiter bends down to apologize and takes the responsibility.
	Anyone who has been in the commercial building for a long time can know that Jamie's dress is a famous brand, and if Jamie asks for compensation, the waiter cannot afford it.
	Jamie and Jozo walk into a store with a strong style. Jamie walks around the store for several times and sees a long white trench coat which is very similar to the style with hers, so she has it taken down and changes it in the fitting room.
	"Give me your clothes, I'll hold them for you. Just try the new one." Jozo smiles at her and says.
	Without doubt, Jamie hands Jozo the clothes, and then carries her handbag into the fitting room.
	After she goes in, Jozo reaches into her clothes, and soon finds the bulge inside her clothes. She smiles proudly, and then takes it out and puts it in her handbag.
	It's Jamie's cell phone.
	After a while, Jamie comes out of the fitting room, wearing the long white windbreaker. Today, she is wearing a pair of tight pants with suede knee-length boots. With this windbreaker, she is permeated with the breath of fashion, which makes people cannot move their eyes from her.
	Jozo pretends to be gentle with a flash of jealousy in her eyes, which is quickly suppressed by her and turns into gentleness.
	"It suits you very well, or just take this one?" Jozo praises, but she doesn't mean it.
	Jamie also likes this dress very much. Without hesitation, she takes out a card from her wallet and pays the price. She tells the waiter that she is wearing it away.
	Jozo's eyes stay on the card in her hand for a few seconds before she says casually, "Dan is really good to you. Is there a lot of money in this card?"
	"What?" After pressing the password on the machine, she says, "This is my own card."
	She saves a lot of money in FS over the years, and her salary in CR is high and her commission is large. After a few months, she has her own wealth.
	It's just a dress, she can afford it herself.
	She looks at Jozo funnily, takes a bag from the shop assistant, puts the dirty clothes in it, and throws it into the trash can outside when she leaves the shop.
	Jozo doesn't speak, but her jealousy deepens.
	"Alma hasn't come back yet. Why don't we go around these places first?" Jozo suggests. She looks at the direction Alma has just left, and she feels relieved. Alma doesn't come at the moment, so she should not come for a while.
	She still has time.
	"By the way, he told me today that he would take you to his place, saying that he has something to ask for you. Do you want to go there?" They don't go upstairs. There are many people in the elevator. With Jozo in a wheelchair, they stroll on the first floor.
	Jozo suddenly says this, which surprises Jamie, but it is a surprise to Jamie.
	Jozo gets in touch with her brother?
	Jamie bites her lips. Her doubts get stronger.
	Just go and see if that person is her brother, and then everything can be revealed. What’s more, she can't contact him recently, so it's not a bad thing to see him.
	"When did he come here?" For the sake of safety, Jamie cautiously doesn't reveal the fact that Chris is already in country C, but asks Jozo instead.
	A trace of doubt flashes in Jozo's eyes, which is fleeting away immediately. It turns out that the man is not in country C.
	"Not long ago, don't you know?"
	Jamie shakes her head and looks at her curiously.
	Jozo relaxes her vigilance, and smiles and says, "He said he missed you very much. Maybe he has sent someone here."
	"OK, when?" Jamie nods, thinking what she should ask him when she meets Chris. He doesn't notice Jozo's eyes behind her at all.
	"It will take about 30 minutes. He says he would send someone to pick you up." Jozo says softly, the expression on her face is very natural, and Jamie couldn't see a flaw. "Hey, he doesn't even say he wants to see me, which makes me a little sad."
	Jamie now 50% believes her. After learning that Jozo feels lost, Jamie comforts her, "It doesn't matter. There is much time in the future to see each other."
	Jozo's sadness eases a little, but she couldn't help sneering in her heart. Who wants to spend the future with you? It's best never to meet each other!
	Half an hour later, Jozo tells Jamie that she couldn't stand out, so she takes Jamie to the back door of the trade building and goes out from here.
	Indeed, compared with the main entrance where people come and go, there are few people in the back door. There is also a small garden here, and a small road, where the monitor can’t see. 
Chapter 368: She is Lying to Her
	Soon, a black car drives here and stops in front of them.
	"Miss, please get on the car." The man in the car is a man Jamie has never seen before. He is dressed in a black suit, capable and professional.
	This car is a black Cadillac, with a shiny body and a low-key look in black.
	Jamie hesitates for a moment, then opens the door and gets in.
	"Say hello to him for me." Jozo smiles softly at her, and her eyes are sad, but not obvious.
	It just gives Jamie a loss that she can’t see her brother. Jamie doesn’t doubt her. She nods and then closes the car door.
	The car drives away.
	Jozo's gentle eyes darken in an instant. Looking at the car leaving, she laughs scornfully.
	Jamie, you have never expected to fall into my hands one day. I want to see how lucky you can be.
	At this time, the cell phone rings suddenly. Jozo opens her handbag and sees that Jamie's cell phone rings, which is a message.
	It’s from Dan.
	Jozo turns up the information and sees the text message Jamie sent to Dan before.
	Jamie, “Dan, look at this sign. I seem to know what it means.”
	The following is a picture of CR logo.
	Jozo doesn't care, and she turns to see Dan's reply.
	Dan, “Hmm? What does it mean?
	Jozo's eyes tighten, then she clicks on the information bar, suppresses her unwillingness and anger, and edits a message to reply him.
	Jozo, “I won't tell you.”
	Because she doesn't know what the sign means at all. She’s afraid if she answers directly, it will arouse Dan's suspicion.
	Now, Dan must not find Jamie missing. Even if he finds it out, it must take some time.
	After thinking for a while, Jozo sends another message, “I am shopping in the trade building, and I will be home late today.”
	Dan replies quickly, “Fine, you just recover from allergy. Don't be too tired, and come back at once after shopping.”
	Jozo endures the impulse to throw the mobile phone against the wall, and her hands tremble slightly. After a long time, she sends the message out and immediately turns off the mobile phone.
	She's afraid to see Dan's words of concern for Jamie again, and she can't help but wants to smash this mobile phone, but she can't. It’s still useful for her to keep it!
	Dan looks at the text message sent by Jamie on the screen. There are only two words, “Got it.”
	His eyebrows slightly raise, thinking what is going on. Suddenly, his eyebrows jump violently, and then returns to normal.
	Is she in a bad mood today? Generally speaking, when texting with her, her tone should be more playful, and even there will be some emoji.
	Is it because he can't go out with her today, and she is losing her temper?
	Dan rubs his eyebrows, thinking of Jamie's depressed face, then he feels that all the tiredness has eased a lot. After a while, someone knocks on the office door.
	"Come in please." He speaks quietly, locks the screen of his mobile phone, then puts it aside and turns his eyes to the computer.
	Secretary Sam comes in. She puts a stack of documents in front of Dan, and then says, "Mr. Dan, customers from abroad suddenly arrives at the airport one hour in advance. Should we go there now?"
	Dan stops typing the keyboard, and the fatigue just now in his pale brows disappear. "Well, prepare the car."
	"Yes." Secretary Sam nods and goes down at once.
	Dan turns off the computer, then stands up, picks up the mobile phone on the desk and walks out.
	Jamie sits in the back seat of the car, looking at the window, but she can't see the scenery outside, because the window seems to be covered with a film, which makes it impossible to see the outside.
	Jamie doesn't care too much, but today's road seems to be very smooth, and it doesn't always turn around, and the road is also very long.
	"How long will it take?" Jamie sits close to the window and tries to look outside. She doesn't see anything, so she turns to ask the two people sitting in the front.
	"It will arrive soon. Please don't worry, miss." The man who answers her is sitting in the driver's seat. He is wearing sunglasses, and she can’t see his face clearly.
	His words are respectful and polite, and Jamie's doesn’t worry too much.
	Jamie opens her handbag and wants to take out her mobile phone to check the time, but she doesn't see it in her handbag. She touches her clothes pocket and suddenly finds that her previous clothes have been thrown into the trash can.
	She forgets to check if there is a cell phone in her pocket and threw the clothes away!!
	Jamie, you're really stupid!
	The mobile phone should have been thrown away by her at that time, but fortunately, she has two mobile phones, one for the main use and the other for the auxiliary use, and the one thrown away happens to be for auxiliary use.
	This is a habit she developed when she was in England.
	No one knows if his mobile phone will drop or be stolen, and there are often many important things in your mobile phone, so you have to pay attention.
	Especially, she likes to save the design drawings in her mobile phone. If someone takes them away, and accidentally publishes those design styles, it would be terrible.
	Jamie suddenly feels that fortunately she is not so stupid, and she has another phone.
	And fortunately, Jozo doesn't find any useful information in her mobile phone. That hone doesn’t even have the combination.
	The car drives for a long time, so long that Jamie can feel it has taken at least one hour. She gradually feels a bit uneasy and worried.
	Somehow, the atmosphere in the car suddenly becomes tense. Jamie leans against the seat, clutching her handbag tightly with both hands, and doesn’t dare to take deep breath.
	Last time, Chris took her around many corners, but it only took about 40 minutes to get there.
	But this time, it takes so long...
	A strange feeling spreads throughout her, and the unspeakable tension grips her heart tightly like a pair of big hands, which makes her afraid to move.
	Just now, the joy of seeing her brother is overwhelmed by the fear that gradually surges up.
	If he wants to see her, why doesn't her brother pick her up in person? He loves her so much, how can he not even have time to see her?
	Even if he really doesn't have time, his assistant Maris must have time. He can let Maris pick her up. How can he let someone she doesn't know pick her up?
	And Jozo, it is her who was alone with her from beginning to end, and Alma never appeared. She is in a wheelchair. How could she run to such a crowded place just to meet her?
	Would... Jozo be lying to her? Jozo is not the person sent by her brother at all!
Chapter 369: Welcome Home, Daddy
	So these people…….
	Jamie Moore promptly lowers her head, afraid that these people will notice the fear and doubt in her eyes. She clenches her lower lip between her pearly white teeth, while her heart beats as if it will thump out of her throat. She should calm down, and when she finally does, she has no communication tools at her disposal. And even if she did, it would be impossible to call Dan William under the scrutiny of the two pair of eyes. And this car has been driving for so long already, she fears……She really wants to hit herself. How could she believe Jozo?
	No, she has to find a way to get out of the car.
	“Oh, how long will it take to get there? My stomach hurts.” Jamie Moore suddenly cries out as she covers her abdomen before curling up in her seat in agony.
	The two men in the driver’s seat look at each other, and start talking quietly.
	“Do you want to stop so she can go to the bathroom?”
	“Are you stupid? Can you take on the consequences if she is faking it?”
	“It doesn’t look like she is. Besides, she doesn’t know who we are, what’s there to afraid of?”
	“Are you sure? It’s better not to take any risks. We’ll arrive in about ten minutes, then we can let her go”.
	With a nod to each other, they say to Jamie Moore, “I’m sorry Miss, can you hold on for ten more minutes?”
	When she sees that her plan is not working, she doesn’t continue her faking. Instead, she ferociously bites her lip and sits down by the door before breaking off the door light.
	“Stop the car! I’ll jump if you don’t stop!”
	The man in the passenger seat gives the driver a look that clearly says “see, she was faking it”.
	“Miss, stop joking. We’re on the highway, if you jump you’ll probably lose your arms and legs”. The man in the driver’s seat coldly says to her.
	Highway? No wonder they are going so fast.
	But she would rather lose her arms and legs than not know where these men were taking her. With this thought, she starts to open the door. The man in the driver's seat gives her a sharp look, and then turns the car violently. Jamie Moore, who was about to open the door, is then tossed to the side by the sudden sharp turn. With a low curse, she bumps into the other side of the door. Before she can recover, the car is turned again, forcing her to grip the armrest to avoid being thrown out by the man's crazy driving style. As soon as the man steps on the gas pedal, their speed had increases so much that Jamie Moore can’t take in. It is making her stomach churn. Due to the driver’s wild driving style, the ten-minute journey is shortened to four minutes
	The door is opened by two men in black, who pull the backseat cover and then pull the pale Jamie Moore out. As soon as her legs touch the ground, Jamie Moore feels as if she is floating. Her legs feel weak and her stomach is churning. Not being able to hold it in for much longer, she leans on the car before vomiting.
	“They’ve arrived”. One of the men says as he sees someone waiting not far from where they were. After saying those words, he grabs Jamie Moore by the neck. As Jamie Moore straightens up, she sees black spots before losing consciousness. The two men in black do not dare delay, so one of them drags Jamie Moore towards the man. “We’ve brought her.” The two men in black say respectfully as they come up to the man. The man does not look back, and only a sharp breath emanates from his body. Even though he is standing with his back to them, it can still be felt.
	“Mm, the helicopter will arrive in ten minutes. Go get ready”. The man says as he lowers his head and plays with an old ring on his finger.
	“Yes.” The two men in black say as they put Jamie Moore on the ground before retreating. After a while, the man finally turns his head. Wearing sunglasses and a high hat, his appearance can’t be seen clearly.
	His eyes linger on the unconscious Jamie Moore for a moment before he says to the people close to him, “call them and make them hurry up!” With a startle, the man in black next to him respectfully answers, “Yes!” before immediately calling the helicopter pilot and urging him to hurry.
	"Help her up here." The man says as he points to a seat next to him before pointing to Jamie Moore. Although the man in black is puzzled, he does not dare ask questions. He helps Jamie Moore up and puts her on the seat before moving aside.
	With a casual glance at Jamie Moore’s pale face, the man unties his black coat and covers her with it. The corners of the mouths of the men in black confusedly twitch. What are they seeing? A man who has never before been so considerate with a woman? Would anyone believe it?
	--
	After finishing up with his clients, Dan William returns to his manor at about six in the evening. Just as he enters, Bunny comes down the stairs.
	“Welcome home, Daddy.”
	“Darling.” Dan William says as he hugs Bunny’s soft little body and kisses him on his beautiful and soft small face. Bunny’s face turns red, since there are still many servants around and his image can plummet. "Daddy, hasn’t Mommy come back with you?" Bunny asks, finding it very strange that he doesn’t see Jamie Moore. Because when his mommy goes to the company, she always come back with his father after work. So why aren’t they together today?
	“Hasn’t mommy come back yet?” Dan William asks with a frown. Looking at the retro style clock on the wall, he sees that it is already six forty. Usually when it’s so late, and she hasn’t returned, Jamie Moore gives him a call to let him know. And she is always on time for dinner. With this thought, Dan William feels the unease in the bottom of his heart increase. Putting down Bunny, he takes his phone from his pocket to give Jamie Moore a call.
	But it is turned off.
	Jamie Moore……except for an empty battery, his phone wouldn’t have turned off so easily. The space between Dan William’s eyebrows skips a few times before he dials a number. The person he is calling is in charge of the Trade and Commerce building on CR Street. The place where Jamie Moore went shopping today must be there.
	The logo of CR will be blue. The moment the phone call connects, Dan William asks the person in charge to check the surveillance camera videos from two to six o’clock this afternoon and send them to his computer before hanging up. Seeing Dan William, Bunny’s expression is imposing and fierce as he now knows that the situation is very bad. 
Chapter 370: Special Meaning
	Furthermore, it certainly has something to do with Mommy.
	After hanging up the phone, Dan William immediately goes up the stairs, taking three steps at a time which enables him to arrive upstairs more quickly. Bunny follows him, but his pace was a bit slower.
	In the study, with a cold and calm face, Dan William goes to his desk and turns on the computer. Once it has turned on, he opens the surveillance video that was sent to him and looks at it closely. Bunny then comes in to the study, his hair shaggy since he’d been running for a while.
	But he was still cute and handsome to him. He can’t see the video since his head doesn’t reach the desk, so Dan William takes him into his lap. “Daddy, is mommy in trouble?” Bunny asks as he watches the surveillance video. There were people coming and going from every angle. With so many people, finding his mother was like looking for a needle in a haystack.
	“It looks like so.” Dan Williams says, his attention not wavering from the surveillance video. Giving the phone to Bunny, he says, “Call your mother. If her phone’s battery isn’t used up, it should connect.” With a nod, Bunny dials Jamie Moore’s mobile number. He calls several times, but none of the calls connects.
	“Daddy, it’s turned off.” Bunny says as he hangs up and looks at the computer screen. This was expected, so Dan William wasn’t disappointed. Focusing all his attention on the monitor, he realizes that in order to find Jamie Moore he should work quickly and accurately.
	Bunny does not relax, instead he copies the surveillance video in order to watch it on his own computer. The study is quiet and the atmosphere nervous as father and son silently search for her in the video.
	"Young master, look here, isn't it your mother?" Night.7 says from behind Bunny as he points to the figure on the screen that almost looks like Jamie Moore. Even though only one side of her face is visible, Bunny can clearly see that the dress the woman on the screen is in, is the same one his mother was wearing when she went out today.
	Jumping down from the sofa, Bunny goes to his father. As he walks towards him, he sees him watching the next scene of the video. In the video, Jamie Moore slightly raises her head, and her eyes are filled with tenderness and surprise.
	"Daddy, what is Mommy looking at?" Bunny asks curiously, as he moves a small stool closer to the desk before standing on it. He finally reaches the desk, that is at least a head higher than him, and leans his hands on it.
	“The logo of Daddy’s company”. Dan William says as a softness gradually appears in his cold eyes. After staring at Jamie Moore for a few seconds, he sees another person in the video. That person was Jozo.
	Not fully understanding, Bunny nods. Wasn’t CR his Daddy’s company logo? Then why does mommy keep staring?
	Oh right! Aunty Wendy once said that Daddy’s company logo changed after he took over as president. It supposedly has a special meaning. Tilting his head slightly, Bunny thinks about it but is unable to understand the meaning of the two letters. His thoughts are soon interrupted by another person suddenly entering the screen. How did Jozo appear here?
	“Derek William, call Alma and tell her to come here immediately”. Dan William orders at the same time Jozo appears. His eyes are dim as he stares at their movements.
	"Yes, Young Master." Derek William answers with a slight nod, before immediately going out to make the call. Even though Jozo behaves normal, it is still outrageous.
	After a while, Jamie Moore and Jozo can be seen entering the Lockwood Dessert shop. The Trade and Commerce Building had surveillance videos in all of the stores, so he goes back and searches for the video of the desert shop before clicking on it.
	--
	Alma didn’t buy the drink like Jozo said she had. But when she goes to the bathroom, she is trapped and locked inside. Outside, she doesn’t know what is blocking the door, so Alma kicks the door several times but still fails in opening it.
	At this time, Alma understands that in order to get rid of her, Jozo is deliberately locking herself up in the bathroom.
	Alma doesn’t know what Jozo is going to do, but since the second task Dan William gave her is to supervise Jozo, she grows more anxious. Jozo has always been guarded on guard against her.
	The times she goes out, she doesn’t bring her, while the times when she does, she is put aside. Never again would she be shut out like today.
	Alma feels more and more suspicious about Jozo. The bathroom here is a bit remote, and since it's a closed single room, it's impossible to climb out. Alma fears that while she wastes time going down, Jozo will do something she won’t be able to explain once she arrives.
	Not caring whether things get damaged, she kicks open the door. Once she’s done that, she notices an old wooden table that was blocking the door. Looking at the table, Alma’s face instantly feels cold as she kicks it away before leaving there immediately.
Chapter 371: Poisoning Coma
	Worried that Jozo will see her, she tries not to be too blatant. She can only hide her own breath while looking for her slowly. Sure enough, it makes her find not only Jozo, but Jamie Moore too.
	Not knowing where Jozo is bringing Jamie Moore, she quietly follows them while at the same time noticing they are being followed by two men in black. Alma recognizes one as one of Dan William’s subordinates, while the other she doesn’t recognize at all. Since he is following Jamie Moore, she isn’t sure whether he is friend or foe.
	To be on the safe side, she makes the man she recognized confront the one she doesn’t recognize, before following Jamie Moore herself. But what Alma doesn’t know, is that this move that later will lead to many irreparable things, undoubtedly cut of the only chance Jamie Moore has of escaping those people.
	The other person who is also following Jamie Moore, is Night.5, a member of the five-person organization sent by Bunny to protect his Mommy. About to catch up with Jamie Moore, Night.5 is suddenly stopped
	After a fight, he is surprised at the man’s strength that is not inferior to him. Their strength is relative, and there is no victory nor defeat for a while. Night.5 wants to resolve the fight as soon as possible, but is then entangled by the man, which results in him losing sight of Jamie Moore.
	“Who are you?” Night.5 asks in a cold and calm voice as he looks at the person who was wearing the same clothing as him, but still very different. Although Night. 5’s breath is cold and heavy, the anger remains. The man is really cold, as if cold to the bone.
	“You don't have to know.” Mone William coldly whispers, not halting his fight and continuing to greet Night. 5’s fighting style. Mone William and Alma are familiar with each other, so naturally he will not doubt her words that this person is a suspect. He was ordered by Dan William to protect Jamie Moore, so he won’t let anyone take advantage of that.
	But, it seems you and Alma have created great opportunities for the enemy, brother. Li Mo doesn’t realize that he has made a big mistake. He can’t get away from Night.5, and has no way of reporting to Bunny. Moreover, he first has to beat the man.
	As Alma follows Jamie Moore and Jozo out of the building, she sees Jamie Moore get into a car that is parked in front of them. Standing in the same place while deep in thought, she observes Jamie Moore’s behavior. It was as if she knows these people.
	If Alma goes over and asks Jamie Moore to leave with her, it will be without consideration, that will alarm Jozo. These seconds of thinking and being confused, become fatal for Alma. A man silently approaches her, and knocks her out, before dragging her away.
	On the ground, she leaves behind her phone. Once night falls, conspicuously in the dark, the black screen of the phone suddenly lights up. Two words flicker on the screen; Derek William.
	----
	After Derek William calls Alma, and the call doesn’t connect, Dan William sends him to fetch Jozo. It turns out that Jozo is in a coma for some reason, uncertain whether she will live or die. Dan William doesn’t let Derek William bring her to the hospital, but he does let the medical team who had been caring for her, treat her.
	The final result is that her food was poisoned.
	With a sneer, Dan William looks at the last place Jamie Moore appears. His eyes are cold, and the anger floating through his body is even more frightening. Now it's basically certain that Jamie Moore’s disappearance has something to do with her, but since she's still in a coma, it's almost impossible to get an answer.
	If she wakes up……
	Dan William’s pupils constrict next, and his thin lips tightly purse as he represses a cold air. He then calls Bruce Hill and Duke field to come over, and they are accompanied by Wendy and Eddie Charlies.
	From Duke Field she hears that Jamie Moore is missing. Not being able to sit still, and not wanting to be alone with Duke Field, she takes Eddie Charlies along with her.
	“What’s the matter, brother? Have you found Jamie Moore already?” Bruce Hill asks as he enters the room on the second floor and sees Dan William behind the desk. Duke Field also looks his way.
	“How can Jamie Moore be missing? There aren’t many she has offended. Is someone playing tricks?” Wendy asks. Jamie Moore doesn’t get along with many people, so she only knows a limited number of people. If you don’t know many people, how can you offend them?
	“It has been established that it has something to do with this person.” Dan William says as he turns the computer on his desk to them. The video pauses at the scene where Jozo and Jamie Moore go to the back door of the Trade and Commerce building.
	“This woman…isn’t that Jozo?” Wendy asks with a twitch of her mouth. How could Jamie Moore and her be together? Her appearance doesn’t show any unwillingness, and if she was being trapped, she wouldn’t be brought like this.
	“Brother, this woman didn’t kidnap Jamie Moore because she was jealous of her becoming your wife, right?” Bruce Hill asks Dan William. Bruce Hill could still remember the woman who had saved Dan William’s life and was still an admirer of him.
	The jealousy of women was just horrible. In the room, Bruce Hill’s words bring about a silence as they look at Dan William who’s face doesn’t change. After turning the computer to him, he presses a key to speed up the video playback.
	After, he presses pause, “This is where Jozo returns to the Trade and Commerce Building. However, Jamie Moore doesn’t return. It is likely that Jozo has an accomplice.”
	“If it’s like this, then can’t you just grab Jozo and ask her?” Wendy asks hurriedly while being worried about Jamie Moore. “When Derek William found her, she was in a coma due to poisoning.” Dan William says, his voice cold and eyes devoid of joy and anger.
	“Poisoning?” Wendy says, feeling as if her heart is breaking into a thousand pieces. “Then give her the antidote. Jamie Moore is missing, what if something happens to her?”
	Eddie Charlies eyes relax as he sees look at Wendy's eyes tinged with softness. Going over to her, he takes her hand and comforts her, “Don’t worry, we still have Dan against them, right?” His words were like a reassurance, and Winnie's restless heart gradually settled down.
	Duke Field’s hand which was already midair stiffened, and he slowly pulls it back. Acting as if nothing has just happened, he doesn’t know where to look. Bruce Hill helplessly sighs at the actions of the three people.
	Compared to Eddie Charlies, his relationship with Duke Field was better. But he knows very well that it isn’t unreasonable for Wendy to choose Eddie Charlies. Even though Bruce Hill feels sorry for Duke Field, he still feels that it is better that Duke Field puts his hand down.
	“Don’t be anxious, Aunty Wendy. The poison isn’t a common poison, and is not easy to cure” Bunny says, his face cute and handsome and voice cold while he looks at the data on Dan William’s computer.
Chapter 372: Do You Have a Suspect?
	Furthermore, the poison that was used on Jozo is similar to the one that his grandmother had been poisoned with. So in other words, it comes from the same place.
	“Have there been any changes in City A recently?” Dan William asks with a pale face as he moves his eyes away from the data on the screen.
	“It doesn’t seem so…” Bruce Hill says as he thoughtfully touches his chin. “If yes, then it should be people who are not City A citizens that have entered the city recently. I’ve send people to check it out, they are just ordinary workers.”
	Dan William’s eyes flash a bit, “Send some people to look for them, to see if they are still there.”
	Thinking of the same thing, Bruce Hill nods before moving to the side to make a phone call. A few minutes later, the calm on his face is replaced with anxiety. As he looks at Dan William, his eyes are somewhat complex, “Brother, those people have disappeared overnight”.
	He really is careless.
	If they are just ordinary workers, why did they come to City A? It is known that these cities in Country C are not far from each other, so generally few will give up their locality for another place. Furthermore, Country C is located near the coast. Since many of the cities are far, some have to travel by water.
	But whatever he says now, will be useless. At this moment, Bruce Hill deeply realizes the pain of a single slip that will cause everlasting sorrow.
	“Go and check. If they are in a certain place, there will be traces”. Dan William says with a glance, not surprised at the outcome as if he had been expecting it. Upset, Bruce Hill lowers his head before nodding and immediately going down to send people to search.
	“Duke, you will send someone to block and check all the airports, train stations and the docks in City A. Especially the docks, those people will likely try to leave from the docks” Dan William says as he leans back. He doesn’t seem to be in a hurry, and gently turns the cufflinks on his shirt.
	Duke Field nods as his eyes are fixed on the cufflinks. This is a display of the consistent suppression of his thoughts, and an act to ease his inner anxiety.
	“What about us? What can we do?” Wendy says as she watches Bruce Hill and Duke Field both be assigned their tasks. They can’t just do nothing. Dan William turns his eyes towards Eddie Charlies “I know your company specializes in communication and network.”
	Without asking, Eddie Charlies understands his meaning and nods. Wendy doesn’t understand what she has just heard, but since Dan William and Eddie Charlies don’t explain, she has to endure her curiosity and leaves with Eddie Charlies. After they leave, Bunny jumps onto the bench and looks at his father with big shining eyes “Daddy, baby can do a lot of things”.
	“It’s time to check your achievements” Dan Williams says as he points to the laptop not far from them. Daddy will give you half an hour to arrange the information of all underground organizations in Country C”.
	“Daddy, you are pressuring your child.” Bunny says while displaying a miserable look. But in his heart, he is bursting with joy. This is his specialty, so it won’t be a problem for him. Immediately jumping down from the bench, Bunny takes the laptop and goes to work on the sofa.
	Dan William’s smile gradually fades and his gaze suddenly tightens as he touches the photo frame on his desk. Soon after, he takes out a military green colored laptop with an aggressive looking logo on it from the dark case under his desk. One can clearly see that the symbol is that of an unfamiliar bird species, that is not only domineering, but also awe inspiring.
	This is the symbol of the training camp.
	Happy New Year, my dears. I wish you all happiness and health. This is a special computer for training camp. The secret orders or documents sent out by this computer cannot be detected nor intercepted by any machine.
	Dan William quickly draws up a secret order before marking an S below it which will confirm that this task is very urgent. A progress frame pops up and then the secret order is sent directly to the camp headquarters. It will take about 20 minutes to execute this order.
	At this time, Bunny has also prepared all the information Dan William needs. He walks to Dan William’s side and puts the computer on the desk. “Daddy, there are twenty-four major organizations. There are some third rate ones, which are also included”.
	Bunny has directly sneaked into those people's interior, taking the information before leaving. It was very easy for him to copy the information within the specified time. In addition, the information that Dan William had previously given him, made his computers levels increase somewhat which enabled him to work faster.
	“That’s great, son.” Dan William says as he rewardingly kisses his small face before opening and looking at the data. The materials are in fact available outside the training camp. His asking Bunny to check them, had been a psychology test, to see if reading the materials improved his ability. He has in fact not disappointed him. The information he collected is even more detailed than that of the training camp.
	“Daddy, are you looking for an organization that has recently changed? I've seen them all just now, and they're all normal. There's nothing wrong with them. “Bunny says as he pursed his small mouth.
	“Not necessarily. Making Jamie Moore believe and leave couldn’t have been done by one person. If there weren’t others also involved behind the scene, then it wouldn’t have been so easy”, Dan William explains to Bunny while looking at the data.
	As Bunny supported his chin with one hand, he frowned before turning his head and looking at Night.7, “Seven, you’re familiar with this, do you have a suspect?”
	“Most of the power in Country C is in our hands. We will know if there is any abnormality”. Night 7 replies with a shake of his head.
	“Baby, come somewhere with Daddy.” Dan William says to Bunny as he suddenly stands up and turns of the computer. Without any doubts, Bunny nods before leaving with Dan William.
	--
	It feels like the entire world is shaking.
	Jamie Moore is awakened by a sound and a violent tremor. As she slightly opens her eyes, she sees a wooden floor before slowly looking up. As she sits up, she rubs the sore spot on her neck.
	The strong smell of fish makes her sneeze, and then she observes her surroundings. No matter how she looks at it, it seems she’s in a cabin with wooden boards. She could hear the loud splashing of sea waves that had awoken her just now.
	Is she at sea now?
	Jamie Moore shivers at the thought of this, and stands up before trying to find the exit. But the cabin is dark, since there’s only one dim lamp. Barely able to see the road, she cannot see what lies ahead. 
Chapter 373: He Already Knows the Answer
	Jamie Moore fumbles around the cabin for a while, unable to find the door. She then walks to the oil lamp, to light it up. But then the ship violently shakes as the sound of the sea beating against the wood board becomes harsh.
	As she is about to arrive at the oil lamp, she is flung against the board, resulting in a burst of pain in her back. The shaking lasts for about three minutes, and when Jamie Moore doesn’t feel the shaking of ship anymore, she continues on towards the lamp.
	Unfortunately, the ship’s shaking just now didn’t let the oil lamp fall, since it is fixed in that place. Not able to get it out, Jamie Moore stops trying and sits down. By now, Dan William probably knows that she is missing, but when will he find her?
	It has been some time since she’s disappeared, so will he be able to find her or not. As soon as this idea pops up, she immediately puts it aside. Dan William will find her. He surely will.
	Jamie Moore touches the “world” on her neck, and her heart immediately settles down, making her feel as if Dan William was right next to her. Jamie Moore then realizes that besides her necklace, her watch and handbag are both gone.
	Maybe those people fear her having a tracking device on her. Since the necklace is hidden under her clothes and covered by a scarf, it was not found. She isn’t sure how long after exactly, but the door finally opens, and the brightness of a flashlight shines in her eyes, making her squint at the person.
	The man only puts down the food he is holding before leaving again. Jamie Moore is slightly startled. Are these people so kind as to send her food? Is there any poison in it to kill her? Thinking about her current situation, Jamie Moore finds it impossible.
	These people have locked her up, and can crush her as easily as they would an ant. There was no reason to poison her. Jamie shrugs her shoulders. Since it is dark, she doesn’t know the way to the door. How can she find out where her food is?
	Jamie Moore curls her mouth and yawns before putting down her hand in order to scoot backwards a bit so she was more comfortable. But then she touches something. Her eyes brighten as she sees that the thing she is holding up is in fact a piece of a candle, and her heart immediately surges.
	Unable to wait, she stands up and takes the candle before holding one end close to the flame of the oil lamp. Soon after, the candle lights up the whole cabin. The feeling of being able to see in front of you is so different.
	Fixing the candle to the platform, Jamie Moore looks around the cabin that wasn’t small or simple. It has a simple wooden bed with a white blanket and quilt, and some candles and other items that are scattered around.
	Just now, she had fumbled for so long and had swiped everything past the edges of the bed. With a deep breath, Jamie Moore pushes down her nervousness and uneasiness before sitting down on the bed. As she sits down, the bed makes a severe creaking sound.
	This quality…
	Jamie Moore lets out a puff from the corners of her mouth, and stands up before sitting down again. It probably won’t take long before it makes another creaking sound. Fortunately, the bed sheet and quilt are clean, and not as old as the bed.
	“She isn’t really at sea, right?” Jamie Moore says as she stands up and walks towards the board before putting her ear to it. As she listens, she can hear the sound of the sea beating against the board. Sometimes big, sometimes small, it makes her feel as if she was going to drown.
	She had heard of deep sea phobia before, but going to the sea with Dan William had never scared her. But now, only listening to its sound was making her afraid. She immediately sits back down on the bed, and lifts the quilt before covering herself with it so that the sounds are less clear.
	She doesn’t know whether because of a psychological effect or another reason, but Jamie Moore can really feel the sound gradually decreasing.
	----
	A military green helicopter with the training camp logo is flying towards the sea. At the moment, the weather is not bad, which makes the flight go smoothly. Sitting in the back seat are Dan William and Bunny. In his lap, Dan William is holding a portable platform with an icon displayed on the computer screen that the helicopter uses to search.
	“Daddy, if mommy has a tracking device on her, why did we spend so much time looking for her in the first place?” Bunny asks puzzled. With the locator, his mommy’s position could have been found in minutes. So why then…
	Dan William chuckles as his slender fingers beat fast on the keyboard and the icon draws closer. “If it wasn’t like this, how would those people relax their vigilance?”
	At first, the locator couldn’t find the position since there hadn’t been a signal. It had taken about half an hour for the locator to work again.
	“Who are these people? Are they not the ones who kidnapped mommy?” Bunny asks curiously.
	It can’t be…this isn’t an accidental kidnapping, but a long standing plot?
	“Do you already know what the answer is?” Dan William asks as he reaches out to ruffle Bunny’s hair. Instead of telling him directly, he reminds him to answer the question himself.
	Does he already know the answer?
	Bunny is now even more puzzled. He has always been with his father. Apart from the situation of mommy’s position, it could indicate that…
	Coming to a sudden realization, Bunny’s grape like eyes sparkle. “Does daddy want to confuse Jack Moore’s line of sight?”
	“Well.” Dan William faintly answers before slowly explaining. “For five years I’ve been sending people to watch the Moore family. Jack Moore seems like someone who is brave, with endless resources and ambition which he, as a matter of fact, is not. “He has a very important trump card, which is the main reason why the Moore family has not yet declared bankruptcy.”
	No one knows what the trump card is. Maybe it's a person, maybe it's just a thing. No one except Jack Moore knows. Bunny purses his lips while thinking that he may know what that trump card is.
Chapter 374: You Can’t Escape
	It is possible that when Night. 7 reported the matter to him, the person called Night. 9 is someone in the organization.
	Since he went with Adele to the Moore family, when Adele and Jack divorced and she didn’t take him with her. She might have left him with the Moore family. Didn’t Night. 9 listen to Adele’s orders and went to protect Jamie? Then it must be…
	Night. 9 was used by Jack.
	Then it may be absurd that a person from the ten-member Gilbert family will confront the organization. Is he trying to stir up trouble?
	Thinking about it, Bunny feels that it is an insult.
	But it was only Night. 9 who had the ability to help the Gilbert family and to revive its business. He has the authority and a portion of the Gilbert family business. With that, he could save a hundred of them.
	Night. 1 once said, the ten-men team only recognizes those with the secret ring and they are extremely loyal. They live to serve the Gilbert Family.
	At this point, does it mean that Night. 9 is an exception?
	Furthermore, according to Night. 7, Night. 9’s specialty is not in martial arts, neither is it weapons but his perfect medical expertise.
	Medical drugs is a field and he is an expert in it.
	Night. 7 said that among the ten, only Night. 9 had an aptitude for medicine. But his martial arts and weaponry are just as good.
	He intentionally positions himself as the ninth in the group. Apart from the patriarch of the household, no one else knows his true abilities.
	“This time, it is possible that we’ll see the true colors of the trump card.” Dan softly remarks. There was a cold look in his eyes, like the reflection of the moon over still waters.
	…
	Some time goes by and Jamie is still not asleep and is laying on the simple bed with her eyes closed. She tries hard to block out the external noises and after a long time, she opens her eyes due to the noise.
	She has been trying to block out noise with her hand and after a while, her hand begins to stiffen and cramps up. Any slight movement caused her to wince in pain. Jamie stands up to stretch her body and she feels much better. Her face was pale from being enclosed in the boat’s cabin. She is always claustrophobic and is now very uncomfortable.
	She walks to the door and pushes away the food that was placed earlier. She then reaches for the doorknob though she knew that it could be locked, but…
	Huh?
	She is surprised and slowly opens the door. Then she realizes that she has underestimated them. Since they are out in the open waters, even if the door is open, she can’t escape.
	It is great that she can go out for some fresh air.
	Jamie sticks out her head for a look and there isn’t anyone guarding her. So she walks out of the cabin.
	She climbs up the ladder until she reaches the top deck. She is welcomed by a thick fishy smell and the smell of the ocean. It is winter and the cold and moist air is bone-chilling.
	Jamie starts to shiver in the cold and tightens her jacket, places her hands in the pockets, and covers her neck. It’s really cold.
	It is already late in the night and the sea breeze is not only cold, the water still looks blue as the day time but mixed with black ink.
	It is quiet on the boat, apart from the sound of the wind and the waves, there is no other noise.
	Jamie is not stupid to think that there is no one else on the boat unless it is remotely piloted?
	She walks to the railings and looks at the dark and churning waters. Her heart sinks. Though she doesn’t have a fear of the deep ocean, no matter who it is under such circumstances, the mood will be sullen.
	Those people didn’t need to take any precautions to keep her locked up. Out in the wide ocean, unless she grows a pair of wings, how else can she escape?
	But…
	She can’t just accept the situation.
	“You can’t escape.” A cold voice says sarcastically from behind her.
	Jamie turns to look and sees a man in black with a pair of sunglasses and a black hat. She didn’t know when he walked to her side. His right hand is resting on the railing and calmly looks at the sea. She can’t see his face clearly and even the voice was muffled.
	Jamie is surprised, she quickly places her hands in the pockets and looks at him with vigilance, “Who are you? Why did you capture me?”
	Is it because of money?
	Her status as Dan’s wife is well known for such a long time. It’s reasonable for someone to have ulterior motives but she doesn’t know why she has this feeling that they are not the ordinary kidnappers.
	And Jozo… she was too naïve, how could she believe her? At that time she shouldn’t believe her in the hope of seeing Chris, otherwise, she wouldn’t be in this predicament.
	What are Jozo’s motives? Dan? Or to be his wife?
	That person didn’t answer her directly. He didn’t even bother to answer. It was cold to the bones. Unknowingly, they gradually moved closer to each other.
	This man is exceedingly menacing. Jamie desperately wants to flee from there.
	“Just notice that you can’t escape and don’t waste your energy to plan an escape.” He then turns and orders, “Send her back.”
	Two men emerge from the shadows and stand on either side of Jamie.
	“I can walk on my own.” Jamie purses her pink and tender lips, looks at that man for several seconds, and proceeds to the cabin in resignation.
	She hates this feeling. She doesn’t know why they kidnapped her and now she is helpless.
	That man sees Jamie disappear around the corner. His attitude didn’t warm up, instead, he became colder. This wide sea, unless she grows wings, otherwise there is no chance of escape.
	Just at this moment, something happens…
	The calm sea suddenly become rough like being swept by a hurricane. Fortunately, the boat is well built by them to prevent being blown about. Even then, the boat still started to rock and shake. The roar from the rotors is deafening.
	“Daddy, this must be that boat.” Bunny looks at the white color boat and says. One look at the exterior and the boat is clearly different from regular boats. It is more advanced in every way.
	“Yes.” Dan says and leans outside to see the boat.
	“Captain, fly towards that boat.” Dan orders. He looks at the boat and it is still a distance away.
	“Yes Sir.” The pilot replies and immediately flies towards the boat.
	
Chapter 375: They will Harm Mommy
	At this moment, Jamie just arrives at the entrance to the cabin. She is unwilling to enter but is about to enter when she hears slamming sounds.
	She frowns and turns to look and she is shocked.
	“Ryan?” She looks on when Ryan knocks the two men down and walks towards her. “Why are you here?”
	Why do they like to appear suddenly without notice? Fortunately, she has a strong heart otherwise she’ll get a heart attack.
	Ryan shakes his arm and looks at her in relief and walks in front of her and checks her entire body. “Are you alright? Did they bully you?”
	“I’m … fine. But how did you turn up here?” Jamie is still curious and couldn’t believe that he’s here. She didn’t see any boats around them, how then did Ryan get on board?
	When Ryan hears her ask, he laughs in embarrassment and explains, “Today I went with an important customer to the trade center and I saw that you were taken away. I snuck aboard when they weren’t looking.”
	Jamie was relieved and when she sees him relax a little, “I see, thanks for risking yourself to save me.”
	She always trusts Ryan.
	He helped her countless times in England and saved her once. She owes him more than she had repaid him.
	“Don’t thank me, it’s not over yet. We…” The boat suddenly shakes and both of them are tossed to one side.
	“Careful!” Fortunately, Ryan was fast and grabbed onto Jamie while he slams on to the wall.
	When the shaking stops, the noise becomes increasingly loud. They look at each other and then proceed up the stairs.
	There is a commotion on the deck. The once quiet boat is now full of men in black and the boat significantly speeds up. A helicopter follows closely behind.
	“Daddy, they are speeding up!” Bunny shouts. If this boat didn’t kidnap his mother, he would have shouted “Cool!”.
	They can’t outrun the helicopter but the boat is certainly trying to speed up.
	The pilot continues to skillfully approach the boat without hesitation.
	Dan didn’t speak. His eyes are locked on the boat below. He tightly purses his lips.
	At this speed, it is impossible for anyone to board the boat from above. Furthermore, it appears that the boat was designed to prevent being boarded from the air. There was a half-dome above and if anyone is to jump from above, there is 90% possibility that they would fall into the icy cold sea below.
	At that point, it is unclear where the boat’s destination will be. Suddenly, Dan’s eyes fixate on a part of the boat. Jamie and Ryan are standing on the deck and are discovered by the men in black. But they didn’t do anything.
	Their indifference is insulting to Jamie. From their expressions, it seems like they couldn't escape.
	The wind is very strong and the noise from the helicopter is very loud and impossible for Jamie to miss. She squints and looks at the helicopter while grabbing hold of her jacket and shouts, “Is there someone above in the helicopter?”
	Can it be Dan? Has he already found her?
	Ryan looks at Jamie and shifted his gaze but he notices her joy, “I don’t think so. Just now I heard them saying that it was another group of people who want to take you away but they didn’t agree to it, resulting in this situation.”
	She has become a flag for all to fight over.
	“Who are they… why do they want me? For money?” She is very puzzled and can’t help but asks.
	So many people are so busy because of her. Does she have to thank all of them?
	The boat continues to speed up and Jamie needs to hold onto the wall to stand straight. She wants to stick her head out to look at the helicopter but when Ryan said who they were, she dropped that thought. Those are her enemies, what’s there to look at.
	Jamie is getting depressed. Her hand is getting tired holding onto the wall. But the boat didn’t slow down and is still speeding up. The wind is very cold and strong. She can only cover her neck in an attempt to stay warm, barely exposing her little face.
	Ryan can see her uncomfortable and stands behind her to support her with a hand to prevent her from falling.
	Suddenly, the boat rocks violently. Ryan falls to the ground and Jamie also falls to one side.
	Jamie realizes that at this speed, it’s better for her to just lay on the deck. She was worried that she may be thrown overboard if she wasn’t careful.
	“Careful.” Ryan’s hand presses onto the side of Jamie and as a means of protecting her, he holds her tightly in his arms. To outsiders, it appears that he pushed her onto the deck.
	It happens that Dan saw this scene and his eyes glare in disbelief and disapproval.
	“Daddy, what are you looking …” Bunny leans on his back and tries to see what his dad had been looking at for so long. True enough, he sees his mommy being held down by another man.
	That person is so familiar… even from behind Bunny could recognize it’s Ryan.
	But how was it possible that he is there? And he is on top of mommy. Oh no. Dad’s going to be angry.
	Bunny is about to say something and sees Dan take out a gun. He closes one eye and takes aim and shifted the gun’s position several times.
	“Dad! Don’t be worked up. You may hurt mom by mistake…” Bunny was worried when he sees Dan taking out the gun. Oh Daddy, mom’s safety is more important.
	Bunny couldn’t endure and shouts. He wants so much to kill those men in black with a shot.
	Dan fires a shot at the boat. The pilot maintained the direction very well no matter how the boat maneuvers, making it simpler for Dan to take the shot.
	Bang…
	The crack of the shot is muffled by the noise of the rotors but it is still discernible .
	
Chapter 376: Two Birds with one Stone
	Jamie lifts her head to look, why did they shoot?
	A man in black who stood a distance away from Jamie falls to the deck.
	The bullet hit the man’s heart and he dies immediately. How skilled must the shooter be for him to get a kill shot in such conditions?
	“Why are they shooting? Aren’t they the same group of people?” Jamie asks doubtfully. From what Ryan just said, they are the same group. One party kidnapped her and the other wants a share of it.
	But why did they shoot?
	Ryan begins to be flustered, he starts to ponder what to do next. He was above Jamie and she couldn’t see his expressions.
	The speed of the boat eased slightly as a result of the gunshot. Jamie sits up and leans against the wall. She is beginning to get excited.
	“Perhaps those people in the helicopter are getting angry.” Ryan explains softly, his gaze darts around the boat.
	“This boat has been sailing for so long, they must have left Country C.” His voice is deep. If they were going to another state they need not sail so far. They had been sailing for so long and they must have departed Country C.
	“Departed from Country C?!” Jamie shouts in disbelief. She looks at the sea behind her as if she’ll be lost out at sea. She can’t help but feel a sense of hopelessness creep all over her.
	If that’s the case, then it would be close to impossible for Dan to find her!
	At this moment, Dan is preparing to shoot at the next person. He sees that the person on top of Jamie has moved and Jamie is neither injured nor assaulted. He feels much better.
	True enough, he didn’t dare to shoot in Jamie’s proximity. His shooting skills are fast, accurate, and deadly. But he cannot risk Jamie’s life in such unstable conditions. He will regret for life if he hurts her.
	The only way is to kill some as a warning to the others.
	Dan takes a good look at the person who was pressing down on Jamie and he is Ryan.
	He… why is he here?
	Before he can think further, the men on the boat are furious, take out their guns, and point at the helicopter.
	They are on the boat and have difficulty aiming at the helicopter. The half-dome on the top of the boat can be opened. But before all these, that person ordered them that no matter what happens, they are not to open the half dome. So, none of them dares to open the dome.
	They can only lean out and fire a few shots at the helicopter.
	But how can the helicopter be so easily hit by the bullets? Those bullets didn’t even leave a mark on the helicopter.
	Bunny takes out a megaphone, clears his throat and shouts at the boat below.
	At the same time, Ryan sees Jamie rubbing her ears and asks, “Are your ears painful?”
	Jamie nods, “From the constant blowing of the wind and the noise of the helicopter.”
	The combination of these causes her ears to be cold and painful. A gentle touch is unbearably painful. She can only use her hands to warm her ears by rubbing it.
	Ryan takes out a pair of white earmuffs and places them over her ears. Jamie feels much better and the outside noise is reduced significantly.
	“You have this on you?” Jamie raises her eyebrows and laughs. She forgot to take a scarf when she left home this morning and to think that Ryan brought along an earmuff.
	Ryan laughs but didn’t speak. He was trying to distract her from what is happening.
	“All those below listen up. I give you ten minutes to release my mommy. Otherwise, I’ll bomb your boat!” Bunny’s voice is tender and cute but he says this with authority and force.
	Dan is amused, he rubs Bunny’s hair and tries to see the reaction of the people below but he did not see Jamie.
	From their vantage point, he can just make out Jamie’s position but just barely and Jamie is blocked by that man in black.
	Jamie thought that she heard a tender voice in the chaos of the commotion but she couldn’t be sure who’s voice it was and since there are so many people around, she didn’t think more of it.
	Ryan did hear it and recognized it to be Bunny. He laughs irresistibly.
	The men in black are surprised to hear the voice and start to laugh. Did they send a kid to distract them? What games are they playing?
	The men in black are composed and disciplined. They didn’t curse at Bunny and continue to stand fast in position. But they feel uneasy that the other party sent a kid to agitate them.
	“Dad, can I shoot?” Bunny sees that his warning fell onto deaf ears and wants to do something more, begging Dan.
	He guarantees just one shot.
	Dan looks at him and then says, “I’ll teach you.”
	Bunny wants to say no need because his gun skills were trained by Night. 1 and his skills are rather decent.
	But since daddy has already said, can Bunny refuse?
	So he takes out a small silver gun from his boots and Bunny looks at Dan in excitement.
	Dan hugs his small body, his big hand grabs bunny’s tiny hand, and places the gun properly in his hand. He says, “Aim over there, and then…”
	“Bang”, the bullet hits the chest of a man in black. Bunny looks on and realizes that the bullet had penetrated the man’s chest!
	It was not done. That bullet penetrated the first man and didn’t stop. It continued to the wall and ricochets and hits another man on the chest!
	Two birds with one stone!
	Two men with one bullet!
	Bunny’s eyes light up, he is a better sniper than his daddy!
	Excellent! Bunny learns so quickly to become a great shooter.
	Just a moment ago he was hugging his daddy and, in an instant, he became a sharpshooter. He looks at Dan proudly, “Daddy, can you teach me this skill?”
	Dan calmly looks at Bunny’s cute and begging face and said, “It’s not time yet.”
Chapter 377: As Long as We Remain Friends
	There was no continuation of the dialogue.
	What just happened changes the atmosphere of the boat. A bullet just killed two men. The people in the helicopter cannot be underestimated.
	Jamie realizes that the men in black are taking severe losses. But she has not seen the man who spoke to her just now. He should be their leader. But why doesn’t he show himself when so many of his men had died. Is he scared?
	Jamie purses her lips. Please don’t let them hand her over to the people in the helicopter. She doesn’t want to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire.
	If what she had said were heard by Dan and Bunny, then they’d use the megaphone to scream till she hears them. We’re here to save you and you’re not happy? You’re not willing to leave with us?
	“Son, I can’t see your mommy anymore. Let’s think of a way to stop the boat.” Dan pats Bunny’s shoulder. One sentence and he stops Bunny. Should he fire or not? He is conflicted.
	Bunny looks at Dan, Daddy must be doing it on purpose, he surely is! But what he says is reasonable. It’s important to save mommy and not fight it out.
	“Shoot in that direction.” Dan points to a particular position of the white boat. If you damage that area, then even if it doesn’t stop, it will have to slow down. Once it slows down, we’ll have a chance to get closer to it.
	The men in black are being picked off one by one by Dan. This boat can’t accommodate that many people and most of them had been killed. He is not concerned about them.
	Now he is only concerned about one thing.
	Once Bunny sees where Dan is pointing, his sulking face lightens up like a blooming flower. He holds steady the small gun and aims at that position.
	As soon as the pilot hears them, he positions the helicopter in a position to facilitate the shot.
	It’s now or never.
	Bunny squints and squeezes the trigger. “Bang” the bullet hit exactly where Dan was pointing.
	Even the pilot who is usually very picky and has high standards is impressed by the shot. Like father like son!
	Bunny’s little face was not too arrogant when he sees the position where the bullet hit. True enough, the boat starts to slow down.
	The design of this boat is different from the others. No one expects that the most vulnerable part of the boat is not inside but at its most obvious and eye-catching location. And that’s also why no one realizes it.
	But Dan has seen the design plans of this type of boat and when he sees something he doesn’t easily forget. He didn’t expect to utilize this knowledge for this encounter.
	As the boat slows down, Jamie’s churning stomach feels better and the wind wasn’t as strong.
	The atmosphere on the boat became tensed. The men in black continue to shoot at the helicopter. They also sent men to watch Jamie and Ryan, not giving them any chance of escape.
	“…” Jamie clenches her teeth. At this point, where can they run to?
	Dan’s helicopter gets closer and closer to the boat. But the men are prepared. If the helicopter approaches without any preparation, it might be shot up like swiss cheese.
	At this moment, a man in black used the loudspeaker, like Bunny, and shouted, “If you don’t want her to be injured, then get away from us!”
	When the man was shouting, Jamie was right beside but was wearing the earmuffs and with the wind, she can’t hear clearly what he said.
	“If you don’t release her, then let’s see who will be the one injured.” Bunny retorts loudly.
	These scoundrels must have kidnapped his mommy for an important reason. Before getting what they want, they will not harm her.
	“If you don’t believe, then you can try. I can shoot her right now!” The man in black was ruthless. He points his gun at the sea and fires a bullet, kicking up a splash.
	Bunny wants to shout but is stopped by Dan. He turns and looks at his daddy’s calm expression and feels safe and secure.
	“Captain, back off a little.” Dan said.
	“Yes Sir.” The pilot turns the helicopter and takes up a position further away.
	When they see the helicopter backing off, they sighed collectively in relief. If they ended up going head to head, they might not be a match for the person in the helicopter. Good thing they still had a ‘hostage’.
	Without the downwash and the noise from the rotors, Jamie’s face wasn’t as stiff and painful as before. She loosens the ear muffs and asks Ryan, “Have they given up?”
	Ryan laughs and looks at her, “Most likely not, it’s just temporary, perhaps they’ll attack again in a while.”
	Jamie sighed softly and warmly said, “I’m sorry to drag you into this battle but I have to thank you, Ryan.”
	“Don’t be silly, what’s there to thank between friends?” Ryan reaches for her hair which was entangled with the earmuffs, then looks tenderly at her.
	“Of course we’re friends.” Jamie smiles, though she is uncomfortable with his actions, she didn’t want him to feel bad and didn’t dodge his moves.
	“Friends forever?” Ryan isn’t sure and asks again.
	Jamie was surprised and laughs, “Of course forever, unless you despise me and don’t want to be my friend anymore?”
	“No, how can that be? I’m just afraid that after you married Dan, you’ll forget about me.” He answers.
	“Once a friend, always a friend. What’s there to worry about?” Jamie places her chin on her knees and sees his strange expression and then says, “Am I the type who is ungrateful?”
	How can she forget that he saved her life?
	As long as they remain friends. Ryan’s eyes are full of complex emotions that are hard to read.
	At this moment, the father and son in the helicopter realize where they are taking Jamie to. 
Chapter 378: Do You Believe Me?
	From the direction, they are heading for Country G. These people must have ties with Country G, which means that the person behind them should be someone from Country G.
	The distance from Country C to Country G is not very far. From today’s weather, it seems that it will take a day or two to reach. And now, it’s better to wait till they arrive at Country G to rescue Jamie.
	At this time, a unit is already waiting at the border of Country G. Saving Jamie is a matter of time.
	If they had a battle at sea, apart from attracting the coastal police, they could accidentally hurt Jamie. This was something that they want to avoid at all costs.
	When the people on the boat see that they are not taking further actions, they also know that the plan was to deal with it when they reach the destination.
	The helicopter continues to follow the boat. The boat was slow and will not escape.
	Winter nights are long and it’s already three or four in the morning. The boat is closer and closer to Country G.
	Dan and Bunny didn’t slack off and continue to look at the boat. Though it is night, the helicopter has a searchlight and it is easy to see clearly.
	On the boat, one of the men in black took a look at his cell phone, placed it away, and took a few men with him.
	Jamie is weak and leaning against the wall. It’s a good thing that she ate a lot during lunch. Normally she should be fine even if she didn’t eat dinner. But she was weak today because of what happened during the day. She is very tired.
	But she can’t sleep. It’s not wise to sleep here.
	…
	Bunny is still a kid. Dan carries him in his arms for him to take a nap while he continues to monitor the boat’s movement. These few hours, he didn’t even drink a sip, he is afraid that he’ll miss something.
	At that moment, Dan has a bad feeling. Normally his premonition is very accurate. It told him that Jamie is in danger.
	He dared not think any further. He places Bunny down and orders the pilot to deploy the chain ladder.
	“Master, what if they take a chance to retaliate when you are attempting to board the boat?” It was a stupid question.
	What Dan is doing now is to gamble with his own life.
	“Okay, deploy it.” Dan did not bother with the pilot’s caution. He never deviates from what he says. Apart from Jamie, very few can change his mind once it is made.
	Dan is certain of his own premonition. He is willing to be hurt in stead of her.
	The pilot knew Dan for so many years and knows that it’s pointless to say anything. He deploys the chain ladder to allow Dan to descend to the boat.
	The helicopter approaches the boat.
	As the boat moves steadily along, suddenly there is an explosion and the boat catches fire and spreads quickly. As the fire rages on, the beautiful ship became a pile of scrap iron.
	The pilot swiftly turns away the helicopter and avoids being consumed by the explosion. Come to think of it, it was extremely dangerous. It is a difference of seconds, just seconds and the helicopter could have been flipped by the explosion.
	Dan holds onto the chain ladder and his arm was scorched by the heat waves from the explosion. His clean business suit now has a few burn holes. He is unfazed and still fixates at the burning boat.
	That pair of deep black eyes look at the raging fire and inevitably wanted to flee from this. But he is determined. Then to the pilot’s surprise, he leaps from the ladder into the sea below.
	Bunny was awoken by the sound of the explosion. He sits up and sticks his head out to see what is happening.
	He sees a sea of fire and the boat raging in a fire. Even at that distance, he can feel the intensity of the heat on his face.
	Bunny’s heart sinks and holds up the megaphone and he squeezes so hard that the horn broke.
	Mommy… is still on the boat!
	…
	Thirty minutes before the explosion, the men in black approach them slowly as Ryan pushes Jamie behind him to protect her.
	These people are now fully aware of Jamie’s value. As long as they have her, the person in the helicopter will not do anything drastic. That person will not dare to harm them even if they reach their destination if she is in their hands.
	It was this train of thought that Jamie and Ryan were captured by the men in black.
	They back towards the railing and she looks behind at the sea below. At this moment the wind starts to pick up and the waves begin to churn. Her heart sank…
	“Ryan, what are we going to do?” Jamie asks Ryan. She frowns as she looks at the men in black approaching, “Their objective is me, I’m so sorry to get you involved…”
	This had nothing to do with Ryan but because of her, Ryan is now in this predicament.
	When they fall into their hands, she will simply be tied up but who knows what will happen to Ryan.
	“Jamie.” Ryan says softly and didn’t turn around. He looks at the men who are coming faster, “Do you trust me?”
	Jamie didn’t hesitate and nods, “Yes.”
	“We’re very close to G, looking at the wind direction, if we jump into the water, we’ll have a good chance of drifting to there.” He says calmly without a hint of fear.
	Jump in?
	Jamie turns and looks at the sea. Her hair is blown messy by the wind and her face pink from the chill. She looks at the waters below but somehow isn’t afraid.
	But what if they didn’t drift there?
	Jamie hesitates and in her mind was Dan’s dashing looks and Bunny’s cute and tender face. She just can’t bear to lose them. She cannot die, she still has Dan and Bunny. She must not die.
	“This boat will explode soon. If we don’t jump, then we’ll soon be dead, Jamie.” Ryan notices her hesitation. His voice is troubled while the men pause for reasons unknown.
	“Why will it explode?” Jamie asked.
	“Because…” Ryan’s words are drowned by the wind and at that moment, the wind picks up. Jamie’s head is blown from side to side. Jamie could barely make out what Ryan says…
Chapter 379: Did It Really Explode?
	“Three, two, one… jump!” Ryan doesn’t hesitate when they are about to rush forward toward them. He grabs Jamie’s hand and jumps into the sea below.
	Those men in black didn’t expect them to jump in and hesitate before jumping in to look for them.
	It was at this moment!
	“Boss, someone placed a bomb here!” There is a flurry of activities on the boat as the man completes his sentence.
	Boom, boom, boom…
	Three loud explosions ring out from the bow, midship and stern. In an instant, the boat was destroyed. The sea is littered with patches of fire.
	The men who were still on the boat have nowhere to escape.
	Jamie struggles to stay afloat and keep her head above the water. She heard the explosions when her head was underwater and when she came up, the boat was totally gone.
	It… it exploded?!
	Jamie couldn’t believe that the boat just exploded. Did those on the helicopter do it?
	It became clearer when she thinks of it that way.
	She feels that something isn’t right and wants to think about it but the bone-chilling cold seawater engulfed her and she is cold and numb. She is also struggling to prevent the seawater from going into her nose and mouth. She continues to struggle to keep her head out of the water.
	At this moment, she is very thankful to Dan who forced her to learn to swim. Otherwise, she would have drowned now.
	Hang on, where’s Ryan?
	Jamie endures the icy cold water and looks around. Finally, she sees a head bobbing in the water.
	“Ry… Ryan…” Jamie shouted weakly. She wants to swim over but the wind is strong and the waves are churning.
	As she prepares to swim over, a wave comes crashing into her face and she was engulfed in water. She struggles for several seconds before breaking the surface and she takes big breaths to recover herself.
	When she looks in the same direction, she can no longer see Ryan.
	Initially, she felt consoled when she saw Ryan but now she starts to panic. The waves cover her head relentlessly and she feels like she is being pushed farther and farther away. She can only tilt her head backward to ensure she continues breathing and not drown.
	But her limbs are numb, cold, and stiff. She cannot move them anymore as if her limbs have frozen up. She is unable to move them anymore.
	Is she going to die here today?
	Jamie is hopeless and closes her eyes. Even when the seawater gets to her mouth and nose, she does not have an ounce of energy to swim. She couldn’t even feel the icy cold water.
	She is numb.
	“Jamie!”
	She doesn’t know if she is hallucinating as she thinks that she just heard Dan’s voice. But she doesn’t have any energy to confirm. Her final consciousness is being drowned by the sea. She slowly closes her eyes.
	Her entire body slips into the water like being swallowed by death.
	…
	After Dan jumps into the water and swims towards the destroyed boat. He is a strong and fast swimmer but he is still a distance away from the boat.
	“Oh no! This time daddy surely can’t find mommy!” The helicopter’s searchlight is on Dan and Bunny is anxiously looking at Dan.
	Daddy will not only not be able to find mommy at this moment, he might be injured!
	“Don’t worry, I’ll call the Coast Guards of C country to assist.” The pilot is at a loss at the turn of events and was moved by Dan jumping into the water.
	After all these years, he had seen the relationship journey of Dan and Jamie.
	But he has never been so touched by such a tragic scene.
	Master must love Missus to the extreme.
	Bunny takes a deep breath and composes himself. He takes out his phone and calls Night. 7 for her to send someone over immediately.
	As soon as Night. 7 hangs up the phone, she didn’t dare to delay and immediately makes arrangements for it.
	As she is about to leave, someone appears in front of her.
	“Night… 1? How are you able to come back so quickly? Is the problem resolved over there?” Night. 7 looks at Night. 1 excitedly. With Night. 1 around things will be much easier.
	Night. 1 has always had a cool expression but now he looks worried. He looks behind Night. 7 and is disappointed not to see Bunny. “Where’s the young master? We’ve been had!”
	“Ah! Come with me, we’ll speak on the road!” Night. 7 remembered about Bunny’s instructions when she heard him mention about Bunny. She pulls Night. 1 along in a hurry.
	In that patch of sea, Dan stops at the destroyed boat.
	The water is bone-chillingly cold but he is impervious to it. He purses his lips tightly, his eyes want to swallow up the patches of fire.
	These patches of fire are gradually diminishing. There is one piece of the boat that continues to burn and it is very glaring.
	He wasn’t in the sea for long. After he stopped, the pilot deployed a dinghy and now he is standing on the dinghy. He is soaking wet and cold, standing alone in the open sea.
	The sea breeze mixes with the acrid burning smell but Dan didn’t notice it at all.
	The black eyes had the reflection of the sea and the fire and started to tear up. His feelings went from being cold to despair.
	The pilot contacted the training unit and three helicopters arrive Night. 1 and Night. 7 were also among the rescue team.
	Bunny didn’t get the help of anyone and got down the chain ladder and jumps onto Dan’s dinghy. He walks to Dan.
	“Daddy…” Bunny shouts and sees Dan’s sad and despair.
	Dan doesn’t know how long he stood but feels that all his hopes had sunk right there. He comes to his senses when he hears Bunny’s soft voice.
	Before him is Bunny who is strong enough not to cry. His heart melts and became soft and tender.
	
Chapter 380: Must Save Him
	He kneels down and hugs Bunny’s soft and small body. Not sure if it is meant to comfort himself or him, “Boy, mom will be fine, she will not bear to leave Bunny and daddy.”
	His voice is rough, and his big hand pats Bunny’s back gently while hugging tightly to him. Bunny also gently pats his back.
	“Daddy, Mommy will be fine because she knows that Daddy and Bunny are waiting for her.” As Bunny says, he feels that he can no longer hold back the tears.
	Bunny never cries easily even during the time in England when he was bullied by those people. When he was teased by those kids, he didn’t shed a tear.
	Even when Night. 1 was training him and he accidentally gets hurt, he never cries and never mentions it. In front of Jamie, he is always smiling and staying cute.
	Because Bunny knows that Jamie likes him being cute and all smiles. He also heard that because Daddy hardly smiles when he was young, when she sees him smile, it was like seeing a young daddy smile.
	Daddy also said that he is Mommy’s bodyguard. When daddy is not around or when mommy is alone, he must protect Mommy and not let her be harmed.
	But now, Bunny wants to smile and reveal the smile that Mommy likes so much. This way, even if Mommy doesn’t see, at least he knows that she said it before.
	No matter how cute he smiles Mommy still can’t see it.
	Bunny wants to smile the way Jamie likes but his lips start to quiver and his tears start to flow.
	Drop by drop it drips onto Dan’s shoulder and disappears in the wind.
	He should smile, he wants to smile like before, he wants mom to see it but now not only he can’t smile, he wants to cry.
	Ian Moore, you’re weak!
	“Sir, there’s a survivor. He didn’t die in the fire but is badly burnt. He is now barely conscious.” The team leader came to Dan in another dinghy and reported.
	Dan’s eyes lit up and ordered authoritatively, “Make sure you save him! If you fail to keep him alive, behead yourself!”
	The team leader braced up and was frightened by Dan and quickly replied, “Yes Sir!”
	In the end, it was confirmed that this was the only survivor. The rest of the people on the boat were burnt to ashes!
	Though they knew that the chances of Jamie surviving are very slim, Dan is unwilling to give up a single hope. Perhaps Jamie had jumped off before the explosion!
	When Bunny hears this news, his heart was slightly relieved but then he realizes that something wasn’t right.
	“Daddy, how did this boat explode on its own? Those people on the boat aren’t so stupid to blow themselves to pieces.”
	Furthermore, when the boat exploded, there were three explosions. Could it be someone had placed the bombs?
	“Perhaps there was another party on the boat. They can only wait until that man wakes up to answer their questions.” Dan stands up. He has buried all those expressions of desperation and composed himself.
	“Investigate, you must find the mastermind of this!”
	His voice was like a lightning in the cold sea breeze which tore through the air. They could feel his fury raging.
	“Yes Sir!” The team leader did not dare to delay a second and went to handle it.
	Night. 1 and Night. 7 also jumped onto the dinghy. Especially Night. 1 hurried to Bunny’s side and kneels down with one knee, lowers his head and said, “I’m sorry to disappoint little master, Night. 1 is willing to be punished.”
	Bunny was surprised by what Night. 1 did and asked, “What’s wrong?”
	Night. 1 immediately explained in detail to Bunny.
	When he was at Saipan Island observing Hooson and Anna, those who were holidaying weren’t Hooson and Anna. They were imposters helping them to confuse their adversaries.
	When Night. 1 realized something wasn’t right, he reported to Bunny but the message was intercepted. These people were very familiar with their communication protocol and codes. They were surprisingly effective in intercepting their messages.
	Night. 1 decided to fly to C country to report to Bunny in person at the risk of being punished by him.
	It was as if they knew that he would do that and tried to imprison him at Saipan Island. He was lucky to have escaped.
	After escaping, he tried to remain low key until he made it back to Country C.
	Even then, he was delayed for several days, otherwise, today’s events won’t have happened.
	That’s why he looks scruffy and very unlike his usual meticulous self. This is the first time Bunny sees him like that.
	It can be seen how anxious he is to come back to report to Bunny.
	Night. 1 wanted to smile bitterly but it was too late.
	Dan was listening by the side and his breathing became sinister.
	Bunny purses his lips and looks at Night. 1’s repentance, shakes his head, “Stand up, it’s not your fault. We also didn’t see it.”
	Night. 1 was able to realize something was wrong with Hooson and Anna and return in such a short time was not easy. Furthermore, it was at a place which they didn’t have much influence.
	Perhaps they knew that they had very little influence there and that’s why they lured them there.
	This person not only knew them very well but also knew their communications protocol and codes. Who could it be other than Night. 9?
	“If this incident was done by Hooson, then could it be also connected to Night. 9? Dan frowned and asked Night. 1.
	When he says this, Bunny, Night. 1 and Night. 7 are all stunned.
	Dan… how does he know about Night. 9?
	How does Daddy know Night. 9? There were two huge question marks, he then looks at Dan.
	Dan looked at Bunny’s small face and then looks to Night. 1 and Night. 7 and realized that they were all surprised.
	“That Night. 9 is related to you right?” As Dan hears about Knight. 9’s name, he was able to guess that Night. 9 and Night. 1 have something going on.
Chapter 381: Miss It Again and Again
	Except for the terrorist organization under the control of Gilbert family, which was destroyed at the beginning, there won't be anyone else with the name or rank of Night.
	Bunny suppresses his shock. “How does daddy know Night. 9?” he asks curiously.
	After shock, Night.1 is in deep thought. For a period of time he hadn’t been in Country C. In addition, he’d been pursued by those people. Therefore, he didn’t have a clue as to what had happened in the country.
	Furthermore…isn’t Night. 9 already…
	Wait! No, perhaps Night. 9 isn’t dead! Night. 1 finds that something is fishy, and just as he is about to prove it, Night. 7 lines up next to his shoulder. “Night. 9 isn’t dead. He’s alive. It’s just that now he’s on the enemy’s side.”
	Has Night. 9 become their enemy?
	Speaking out those words, he feels like until the facts behind the situation are known, he will stay shocked and surprised. “Your daddy knows many things. First, go back. You won’t find anything here.” Dan William says as he rubs Bunny’s hair while looking in his soft eyes; his tone holds a touch of love. Now, father and son have the same battle to fight.
	Bunny nods while at the same time noticing how cold the sea breeze is, he had not felt it just now. Going by helicopter is much faster than going by boat. Derek William’s flying skill is excellent and within an hour they arrive at the William family manor. The helicopter lands on the previously opened space of the manor.
	The two other helicopters don’t return, but instead are sent to the sea by Dan William to look for Jamie Moore’s trace. But now there is no team stationed at the borders of Country C, since the team Dan William had just dispatched, was supposed to have been stationed at the borders.
	As a result, they miss it again and again.
	The first glimmers of dawn appear on the horizon. After the storm the previous night, the sea is calm. Near the beach, a layer of ice has been formed and a layer of snow has fallen. Although not thick, it seems like the sea breeze itself carries a layer of ice, the cold going up all the way into one’s bone marrow.
	At one glance, it looks as if the whole world is covered in snow. Even the trees were covered with layers of snow and ice. Close to the beach, a small figure washes up, the clothes seeming to blend in with the snow. It not for the black that stood out in the snow, it would be difficult to spot from a distance.
	The pale face, half buried in the snow, shows no signs of vitality. Her paleness matches the color of snow, and her forehead shows obvious signs of bruising that is already turning purple. At this time, a man dressed in black with a scarf and sunglasses, searches in the snow for a while before finally finding the black.
	His eyes fix on the black as he starts walking towards it. His step is unsteady, but he does not fall. Step by step he moves towards the black, and when he finally arrives he crouches down before picking up the person. The small face coming out of the snow was pale, as if the temperature had left her body. With only one touch, her body feels like it is freezing.
	“Sshh…” the man whispers as he, without any hesitation, walks away towards the car waiting outside the beach with Jamie Moore who was dying.
	He hadn’t known that it would snow throughout the night, leaving behind a thin layer of ice near the beach. Until the man gets to the car, his face is only faintly visible from the scarf. He opens the door of the car, and as he bents down to put Jamie Moore, his face that expresses kindness is shown.
	Starting the car, he drives down the road, noticing how the snow and layer of ice on road is making it slippery. But that does not matter to Ryan Jack. As he drives fast, he nearly runs into other cars several times, fortunately narrowly missing each of them. Jamie Moore shows no signs of waking up. With her eyes closed and face pale, it seemed as if her life’s light would be cut off any second.
	The car drives up to a villa far from the city, its location relatively remote. Covered by snow, it’s original appearance is difficult to see. When the car stops, Ryan Jack wastes no time removing the key. Instead he immediately exits the car and goes around it to take Jamie Moore out of the car before quickly walking towards the villa. As soon as he gets to the door of the villa, it opens revealing not only maid servants, but also two well trained men in black.
	“Is everything ready?” Ryan Jack says as he walks in without stopping.
	“Everything is ready in the room you often use.” A woman wearing tight black clothes and sunglasses says as she follows Ryan Jack.
	Ryan Jack doesn’t reply, and quickly moves up the stairs towards the end of the second floor. Raising his foot, he kicks the door open in one go. The room is white, and looks like a hospital ward. Lined up against the wall are several cabinets, full of bottles, jars, needles, medicines and different kinds of instruments.
	There is even an operating table, and Ryan Jack lays Jamie Moore on it. He skillfully takes a pair of white gloves from the table beside him before putting them on, and turning on the light above his head.
	--
	At the William family Manor,
	Two hours have already passed, and the search and rescue team at sea has not yet sent any useful information. In the living room, the soft wine red sofa is full of people, but although that is the case, the atmosphere is still silent. No one speaks first for fear of breaking the silence.
	Bunny who is sitting next to Dan William watches the last video from last night on his laptop. As he watches it, Bunny feels that something strange is going on. Not only do Hooson and Anna Pork show their faces, but there are other details that he also finds strange.
	Because he hasn’t considered it, they have taken advantage of it. Why on earth is Hooson trying to kidnap Jamie Moore again and again? Bunny wrings his eyebrows and thinks for a while. Then he turns his eyes from the computer and looks at Dan William who is looking for something. “Daddy, what is the relationship between Night. 9 and Hooson?”
	The piece of information that Dan William is looking for, had been accidently seen on his father’s computer in the beginning. Since it’s related to Jamie Moore, he is particularly interested in it, which is why he has secretly copied it.
	At that time, he had known that Jamie Moore’s mother, Adele Gilbert, was the matriarch of the Gilbert family, and that her value was immeasurable. But for the sake of tranquility and thinking the ways of the world had changed, a respectable woman like her married Jack Moore, who was of a lower social status.
	As a matter of fact, Dan William once crossed paths with Night. 9. The William and Moore main residences are very near to each other. Once, after he had accidentally walked out of the room’s balcony, he’d seen him. 
Chapter 382: Ten Minutes Is More than Enough
	A little boy of about seven or eight years old hides behind a tree and secretly looks at Jamie Moore and her mother sitting on the rattan vine swing.
	Although at that time Night. 9 had been small, from his body one could see the strength and hardness he possessed. On his body, fierce and gentleness floated as an inexplicable harmony strangely fused together. He’d had only one glimpse, but Dan William had not forgotten. But after that time, Dan William did not seen Night. 9 again. What had Night. 9 been watching at that time?
	Protecting Adele Gilbert?
	But does such a small child understand what protecting is?
	After, when he saw the data on his father’s computer, he made a copy made of it. On it was the information about Night. 9. To be certain, his father must have also seen Night. 9.
	“Did you know that behind the scene Hooson is Moon’s chairman?” Dan William says with pursed lips to the many puzzled expressions. Bunny shakes his head. Does this have anything to do with Night. 9?
	“I think they might be the same person.” Dan William answers as he raises his head, meeting the eyes of Night. 1 and 7. Although he says this, Night.1 and 7 should find it absurd. But the words that had just left his mouth were inexplicably convincing.
	However, Moon is not the influential industry of the Gilbert Family. Night. 9’s interest is not business, but rather the art of healing, something he is crazy about. How can someone who is so into the art of healing, go into business?
	“When the Gilbert family died out, there were four adults among us while six of us were the successors of the organization. We were the most talented, selected out of a thousand people. It was survival of the fittest.” Night. 7 suddenly says after a moment of silence. Without holding back, Night. 1 looks at her.
	Bunny knows that that time is like a scar on their hearts, so he never asks about it. When Night. 7 opens her mouth to talk, he is fascinated.
	“At that time our greatest advantage was that we were young, so while on a mission we were not seen as suspects. There were of course many restrictions.”
	“The reason why the head of the Gilbert family asked Night. 9 to protect the matriarch is because of his medical skills. Between the six of us, his skills excelled.” A trace of sadness can be heard in the voice of Night. 7.
	“Night. 9’s love for the art of healing is beyond anyone's imagination. In order to intensively study a certain case, he would not eat nor drink for days and nights. His sense of responsibility is strong, which is why the head of the family entrusted the safety of the eldest daughter to a seven-year old child.”
	At the beginning, when they had passed the age of childhood, anyone who looked down at them because of their young age, disappeared from the world. They had all thought that Night. 9 and the eldest daughter who had vanished without a trace had died. But they never could have thought, that they’d been living right under their noses in places they hadn’t expected.
	Furthermore, they had betrayed them.
	“What is that you are saying, Night. 7?” Dan William straightforwardly interrupted, sensing that there was something else in Night. 7’s words. Night. 7 pursed her lips before looking at Bunny. “Night. 9 can’t be Hooson”
	On Hooson one can see the reflection of Night. 9.
	“You seem to forget that you were young when you parted. People change, can you guarantee that he is still that child you knew?” Dan William says coldly as he glances at her. Bunny also nods. Even if he had changed, Night. 9 had betrayed them, so how is it impossible?”
	This way, it makes sense as to why Hooson kidnapped his mother.
	“Night. 7, he's right. People change.” Night. 1 says as he turns his head to look at the dissatisfied face of Night. 7.
	When they were kids, Night. 7 and 9 had had a good relationship, where it had been very normal for her to help him speak. Was that unacceptable?
	A meaningful smile finds its way unto Dan William’s lips. It seems that he has found something more interesting. It is shocking that one person plays two parts, so if…
	It is at this time that the leader of the training camp that had been previously seen, enters the room before going to stand in front of Dan William. His whole body exudes a smell of metal and blood, that raises excitement. “Reporting to the master. The man has been rescued and is ready for interrogation.”
	A smile collects in the corner of Dan William’s mouth. He closes the notebook before standing up and looking at him coldly. “Take me there.”
	“Yes.” The leader of the unit replies quickly.
	A smile finally shows on Bunny’s small face. He’s nervous, but is also looking forward to it. Only the one who survived knows whether his mommy is alive or dead. The basement of the William family manor is surprisingly clean and spacious, and the impression everyone has of it is that it is dark and damp.
	The basement has many rooms, each used for various reasons. One of those rooms that is closed, holds the man in black who was rescued. He has woken up, and his injuries have been checked and bandaged. His mouth and all other parts of his body have been strictly checked for any dangerous items.
	At the moment, this person’s life is very important, and somewhat incautious, Dan William’s fury is something these people from the training camp will not be able to handle.
	“Master, this man hasn’t been specially trained in the organization. From the start he probably just wanted to blow up the whole ship, so he sent these rookies out.” The team leader reports while looking at the man on the operating table who is now transferred to a bed.
	“Did they blow up the boat themselves?” Dan William asks with raised eyebrows as he walks towards the man. The pair of dark eyes stared at him for a while but then he realizes that he cannot hold his stare into the eyes of Dan William. It is true then. He is just an ordinary person with no special training. Which is why he has been abandoned by the organization. In a situation such as this, a well-trained killer would have rather died than fall into enemy hands.
	“Can he speak now?” Dan William asks in a low voice as he withdraws his gaze.
	Bunny has never before felt so nervous and afraid. If what they learn from the man is not what he wants to hear, then he doesn’t know what he will do.
	“Yes, but he has only just woken up, and is still very weak. He can last for about ten minutes.”
	Dan William nods with satisfaction. Ten minutes is more than enough.
	“Did you kidnap a woman?” Dan William asks the man in a cold voice with a bow of head.
	With his intimidating eyes, it is as if he can see to the bottom of a person’s heart. The man’s body slightly trembles as he feels severe pain.
Chapter 383: By Any Means Necessary
	It was effortless for people to let him die, now that his life is saved by others.
	People who are psychologically weaker, will generally choose to compromise. This man is no exception. Not able to nod, he opens his mouth. “Yes, yes.”
	“Was she with you before the explosion?” Dan William asks as he feels his spirits lift while clenching his fists. Bunny can’t help but clench his little fist as he stares at the man. For a moment, the man bares his teeth before slowly answering, “She, she and a man jumped into the sea…”
	Jumped into the sea?
	Is that why Jamie Moore wasn’t on the boat during the explosion?
	Dan William’s dark eyes flash, which is synchronized by Bonny.
	“But if she jumped into the sea, with this cold weather and the water’s low temperature…” Night. 1 said after a long time of being quiet, shattering the chance the father and son had.
	Yes, in this case, even if Jamie Moore wasn’t in the explosion on the ship, how could she survive the merciless sea and cold weather. The probability of surviving is extremely low. It feels as if the temperature of the room drops to the point of freezing, and Night. 1 gives Night. 7 a puzzled look. Did I say anything wrong?
	Night. 7 gives him an incorrigible look. He’s touched a sore spot, so it is clear that it makes things worse.
	“As long as there’s still hope, I won’t give up.” Dan William says as his sad eyes suddenly firm up. “Derek William, send someone to search the countries and islands near the sea. She must be alive.”
	She must be alive.
	It isn’t only Dan William that believes that, but also Bunny. Until they hear of her death, they will never give up.
	“Yes! Young Master, Mone Williams has returned.” Derek Williams responds after hesitating for a moment.
	At the same time, Night. 7 also receives news, and relays it to Bunny. “Young Master, Night. 5…has returned.” The two people speak at the same time, and the content is almost similar. Both Dan William’s and Bunny’s eyes suddenly express a coldness. “Bring him here immediately.” They say in a cold united voice.
	----
	With four distinct seasons, this country is not as big and prosperous as country C, but it is peaceful and quiet. It is now January, and while the snow stopped last night, it began to fall again this morning. The whole world is covered with a coat of white feather; wherever you look, it is white.
	No one would have ever thought that someone build a magnificent villa here. Far from the city, the location is a secret with no signal for entering. It seems like the owner of the villa will forever be a mystery. After a long day of tending to her yesterday, even though her breathing is still very weak, she is no longer in danger.
	After being in the sea for too long, her body functions are still weak, leaving her exhausted. When he brought her yesterday, she’d been barely breathing. It wouldn’t have mattered how excellent a doctor was, it wouldn’t have been possible to save her. But it had been Ryan Jack who had saved Jamie Moore. In his words, even if Jamie Moore had been barely breathing, he could still save her.
	The room is warm and simple, colored in blue and white. The heat is on, and Jamie Moore is sleeping like a princess on the blue round bed. Her beautiful face is delicate and pale, and she frowns slightly even in her sleep. Her long and curly eyelashes tremble uneasily, like a butterfly, which is very lovable.
	Even though her pretty lips are dry and cracked, she still stubbornly purses them. It is like she has to resist, and not give in to fate.
	But it turns out that she really does not want to give up. Which is why while being immersed in the sea, she held on, for the sake of survival. Still very weak, her body functions have not fully recovered making it difficult to swallow. Taking some cotton swabs, Ryan Jack dips them in water before gently wiping her lips.
	A bandage is on her head. While at sea, the strong waves caused her to hit her forehead on a reef. Fortunately, it is not serious. It was much better than the cold temperature of her body. Ryan Jack has been guarding her a day and night, keeping her company without any food, drink or rest. If it was anyone else, they would be moved by it.
	But, at the moment, Ryan Jack’s mentality is that he will not be thankful after she wakes up. With the way he is moved, his heart is in a haze. There is even fear of her waking up and him facing the questions in her eyes. After all the effort to save her, Ryan Jack transferred her here, so he could take care of her personally.
	Even so, he still cannot get rid of the sense of guilt. But as time goes by, while Jamie Moore is in a coma, her frame becomes clearer and more incisive. A violent vibration in his pocket alerts him. Afraid of waking Jamie Moore, he had set his mobile phone on vibrate. Looking at the caller ID, he hesitates for a few seconds before letting it connect.
	“Has the person been found?” A voice asks before he can speak.
	Ryan Jack is silent until an impatient urge of the man. “Mmm.” He answers in a deep voice.
	“Very well, I don’t need to tell you what to do next. I want that person, and you have to bring her to me immediately, by any means necessary.” The voice that speaks is domineering and overbearing, with a disgusting air of greed. A struggle is visible on Ryan Jack’s face. Looking at Jamie Moore’s unconscious body, a touch of pity and pain emerge in his eyes.
	“Just wait a minute, she’s half dead. How do you want me to get it done?”
	“Half dead? I told you to bring her here. How could this happen?!”
	“Are you underestimating Dan William’s ability? I brought her to the sea because there had been no other way. Now take a breath!” Ryan Jack said in a sharp voice.
	The man is silent for a few seconds. “Don’t forget that she is still in my hands, if you dare play any tricks, I won’t ever let you see her again.”
	Ryan Jack holds the mobile phone so tight that a crack appears in the outer layer. This is threat, but he knows that the man will do as he has said.
	“I know.” Ryan Jack replies in a low voice before hanging up and throwing his mobile phone aside. Then, he moved to sit next to Jamie Moore again. 
Chapter 384: Is It Worth Your Doing This?
	He could not help touching her delicate and beautiful face. Ryan's eyes, which are cloudy and cold, suddenly become soft and tender. At this moment, he does not have to worry about whether he would be found by her as before.
	She is unconscious now and could not see him.
	He could only look at her so fondly and tenderly from out of her sight.
	He has a humble wish that when Jamie wakes up, she would forget everything that has happened at sea.
	"Jamie..." He mutters, bending over to kiss her, but the door suddenly opens.
	It's that woman, Ryan's assistant. No one knows her name, but calls her Twelve.
	"You seem to like her very much." Twelve comes in. Without any outsiders around, she feels at ease and goes up to Ryan, raising her eyebrows at Ryan’s act.
	It turns out that he did that for this reason.
	For this woman, he disobeyed that person's orders again and again. In order to protect this woman, he even wants to resist that person.
	Twelve suddenly smiles, like roses blooming, and looks very charming.
	Ryan doesn't answer her, and he doesn't feel embarrassed that she has read his mind. He reaches out to sort out Jamie's hair.
	"It's not your style to go through so many years of careful planning but become hesitant because of a woman." Twelve stands leaning against a table, pours herself a cup of coffee, but she finds that it has been cold.
	Twelve looks at him in surprise. Could it be that in order to take care of this woman, he doesn't even have time to make a new cup of coffee?
	"It is framed, you know, not planned." Ryan coolly replies, rubbing his eyebrows. He goes to Twelve, and pours himself a cup of coffee.
	When he turns around, a drop pf tear rolls down at the corner of his eyes.
	Then he gulps down the coffee, which shocks Twelve even more.
	Is he still the Ryan she knows before? He never drinks anything cold or overnight, and he is fastidious about life.
	But this man makes Twelve feel mysterious.
	"Is it worth it?" The false smile on Twelve’s face turns into worry.
	Ryan puts down his coffee cup, feels refreshed and ready to stay with Jamie. He sits down by her side and looks at the face he'll never forget and whispers, "I just love it."
	He just loves it?
	Twelve’s hand that holds the coffee cup suddenly tighten. Then she puts down the cup and pats him on the back with a sharp sound.
	Ryan, who only feels a little painful, glares back at her and warns, "If you wake her up, you will die. Don't forget who you are!"
	Although the relationship between he and Twelve is good, it’s not to her good if she forgets her identity. It doesn’t matter if they play around at normal time.
	Twelve then realizes what she has done. She has lost control and slapped him. Fortunately, she hits on his back. If she hits him on his face, she would not have lived to leave the door today.
	"If you continue, you'll lose yourself in the end. Where's the good of this woman? I've known you for so long, how come you haven’t been so kind to me?" Twelve says angrily, poking him with her hands.
	But she has not the gut to pat him hardly again.
	Ryan gives her a slight glance and then turns to look at Jamie.
	Twelve feels more discontent, and says, "How long have you just met? Are you so obsessed with her like this?!"
	"Twenty years, is that enough?" Ryan's voice is cracked as he says to Jamie, "I've known her for twenty years."
	As far as she knows, Ryan met Jamie in the UK only a few years ago. Didn’t they know each other only a few years?
	But he says... he has known her for twenty years?
	Has he known this woman since she was a kid?
	"You... How do you know each other?" Twelve looks at Jamie seriously.
	To be fair, this woman is very beautiful, and delicate.
	"I knew her when she was a little girl, and she, she doesn't know me." Ryan takes Jamie's cold little hand in his. His eyes soften.
	At that time, he just heard of Jamie but he hasn't seen her.
	Until one day, curiosity got the best of him and he stole a look at Jamie.
	When she was about three years old, she was cunning and mischievous. He saw her, with a stick in her hand, chasing after the dog that came to bully her kitten.
	His first impression on Jamie was that the girl was rude.
	But he saw a different side of her.
	That afternoon she sat in her mother's arms, under the swing of the vines, and listened to her mother telling her stories with a sweet, soft smile on her face, like a cat hiding her paws.
	And then?
	Then he could not help wanting to get close to her, but the peaceful life did not last long. Someone ran into their life.
	"Are you showing off that you grew up together?" Twelve sighs softly behind him, shaking her head with helplessness, then turns and goes out the door, "I hope you won't regret it one day."
	The door opens. Twelve pauses, turns her head slightly, and calls him softly, "Nine." Then she goes out and closes the door.
	Ryan lowers his eyes on Jamie's quiet face and his fingertips shrink a bit as he hears Twelve calling him.
	Sometimes, helves his own identity and hates it at the same time. He hates it because it brings him many troubles; he loves it because he can use the identity to meet her.
	Unfortunately, he is still two years late. Just two years. But it is a lifetime for him.
	Night.5 And Mone kneel in front of Dan and Ian with heads down, hands clasped, waiting for Dan and Ian to punish them.
	Dan didn’t expect it to be a mess. Otherwise, Mone and Night-5 would have been more than enough to bring Jamie back.
	Sometimes, fate can make a disaster that is easy to avoid become complicated.
	As it is today.
	"Have you found Alma?" asks Dan coldly. He raises his hand, rubbing his brows. 
Chapter 385: To Live Is No Worse than to Die
	Derek comes up with a faint concern in his voice and replies, "Master, we haven’t found her yet."
	Speaking of Alma, Mone suddenly thinks of something, and hurriedly reports, "Master, Alma found mistress before us. Perhaps Miss Jamie is in their hands.”
	As he speaks, he glares at Night. 5 with anger in his eyes. For so many years, few people could become his opponent. How could he not be excited?
	But when they came back, they found that it is their man who did this...
	If not for they grew up together, and he knows Alma, Mone would really think that it is Alma who deliberately framed him.
	"Master, it is my fault, and I am willing to be punished." Night 5 is simple. If he knows he is wrong, he would be willing to take the responsibility. He won’t make any excuse and accepts Ian’s punishment.
	However, thinking of the last time when Night. 1 did not take good care of his mother, the little master ignored him for a long time.
	They are not afraid of any punishment, but they feel miserable if the little master ignores them.
	Ian is really angry that because of Night. 5's negligence of duty for not taking care of his mom, so others took advantage of it and hurt his mother., but this time, it isn't Night.5’s fault. How could his dad be a stupid guy?
	There is no other way for Night.5 except to go against with Ian. Although he is angry, Ian would not simply blame Night. 5 and ignores the fact.
	But there must be punishment.
	"I'll punish you for going to country B to look for my mommy, and you won't come back until you find it." says Ian who happens to be looking at a map of that area, and loos for a country far from the sea.
	Country B and Country C are further away. There is a slim chance that Jamie has drifted to country C, so Country C and the nearby sea are their targets.
	Ian wonders why he did that. He just follows his instinct and pays his attention on it.
	Night. 5 is relieved. Fortunately, it's not like Night. 1 said that he would be transferred to Saipan Island. He is sent to a country so close to C. that’s great.
	When he hears Ian saying this, Dan nods his head in recognition and tells Mone, "You're going with Night-5. you could come back when you find Jamie."
	Mone's face collapses. What? Go with the Night. 5? Would they fight each other all the way?!
	Night.5 turns his head to look at Mone, with fierce in his eyes, as if saying that, “Just wait and see if you dare to cause me troubles.”
	Without much delay, Night 5 and Mone immediately pack things up and set off for Country B.
	"How's Jozo?" A moment of silence later, Dan suddenly asks, his long fingers tapping softly on his lap, and his eyes slightly closed to hide his emotions.
	"The poison in her stomach has been cleared, but she is still in coma." Derek bows his head and answers him respectfully.
	"Where is she now?"
	"In Miss Hill's villa."
	Villa? Dan's lips curl up in an evil curve. She gave him such a big gift. How could he let her live so comfortably?
	"From today on, throw her in the basement and tell me when she wakes up." The deep, cold voice hits to the hearts like a knife.
	Derek, in particular, is surprised to hear it. A shock look appears in his forever cold face.
	This basement, not the previous one, but the real basement.
	It’s cold, wet and dark, with all the worst conditions.
	In the basement of the hidden chamber, the punishment is the cruelest. Those who are imprisoned where are heinous sinners...
	It seems that Jozo is dead meat this time. Even if she conceals her fault with poison, it is useless.
	"My dear master, country B is in the deep winter now, and the coastal cities are almost covered with ice and snow. We might not find Miss Jamie if we only take more than 20 people there.” Night.1 sends the weather and conditions of country B to Ian and then sends one to Night.5.
	What's more, Night.5 has always been afraid of cold. In country C, this kind of weather would drive him crazy. Moreover, in country B, it is snowing heavily now and the temperature is already below zero.
	Night.5 is not in bad physical condition, but he is just afraid of cold.
	"That's why I send him there." Ian snorts. Wouldn't it be too cheap if the punishment is just for him to find my mother?
	After being together for so long, how could he not know that Night.5 is afraid of cold?
	Night. 1 and Night. 7 suddenly feel shiver. They think they really can't provoke Ian; in case he would keep that in mind and they would still be happy even they are punished. Night.5 was happy when he heard that he would be sent to country B.
	Maybe he still doesn't know he is trapped by Ian.
	Dan raises his eyebrows, looks at Ian's evil look. It looks the same as Jamie plays tricks.
	Ian is the most similar to Jamie in appearance, but Ian’s temper and habits are similar to his.
	The rising temperature in Dan's eyes is freezing as he thinks of Jamie, whose life is at risk, and on his grim face, there is a cold look.
	He would find out who has anything to do with it one by one, and let them feel it’s better to die than to live.
	As soon as Dan is lost in thought, Ian feels the rage emanating from Dan. Ian hooks his little finger on his palm, lifts his little face and says softly, "Daddy, let's go find Mommy."
	If Daddy goes on like this, he'll just keep thinking about his mommy, and daddy can't fall down until he finds his mommy.
	"Huh?" Dan recollects his mind, and he feels the heat on his hands. His giddy mood gradually calms down. When he looks at Ian's little face, he feels warm in the corner of his heart.
	"Yes." Dan reaches out and rubs his hair. Then he looks at the time and smiles lightly.
	Ian looks at Dan's sudden smile and wonders.
	When they were at sea, daddy smiled in the same way. When Daddy smiles in this way, it means that he has ideas of something, and what he need to do is to listen to Daddy.
	Two days later, Jamie still hasn’t woken up. It is still snowing outside the window. It is snowing harder than ever. It is said that it seldom snows so heavily in the city.
	Inside the room, it is as warm as spring days without any chill.
	Ryan is lying on his bed with Jamie. He hasn't rested for days and has been taking care of Jamie. Even he is strong, he is tired. 
Chapter 386: This Is a Photo of You
	Suddenly, the door is opened. Twelve comes in hurriedly from outside and sees Ryan who has been awakened by herself. There is worry in her eyes. “Don’t you have a rest these days?” asks Twelve.
	Ryan does not answer her, but rubs his eyes. He just had a light sleep. Although he is still a little tired, his mental state is good.
	"I'm afraid you can't stay here any longer. Jack is caught by them and is now being chased everywhere. He wants you to go and see him right now. After all, you have most of the forces.” says Twelve. Although Twelve is very dissatisfied with Jack, she has no choice at this moment, because Jack knows some secrets that are against Ryan.
	There is nothing she could do but compromise.
	Ryan frowns, feeling disgusted at the news.
	“Where is he now?”
	"On the islands of the residents. I have them protected."
	Ryan turns to look at Jamie, who is still asleep, and, without hesitation, he turns to walk out the door.
	"Take good care of her."
	He leaves the room leaving the words.
	Twelve gives a light sigh. She would take care of her. But his meaning is to watch her and not let other people get her out. But Jamie is half dead now and no one knows she's here as long as she doesn't leave.
	Twelve is very confident about this, because even Night. 9’s medical skills could not wake her up, it seems that she would be in a coma for a long time.
	"Click!" the door closes.
	Then the fingers that the sleeper has placed by Twelve’s side move suddenly. One of her fingers move, and then two, and then, with a slight quiver of her eyelashes, her eyes open.
	Jamie's dry, aching eyes close uncomfortably as she looks at the strange blue ceiling, then opens it again and she feels better.
	Her watery eyes move, her fine brows pucker slightly as she looks at the strange surroundings.
	Where is this?
	Jamie feels like she's been stuffed with a million bits of ice and then being broken off inside her. It's so cold and painful that she can't even turn her joints around, and when she moves, she makes a loud sound.
	She tries to sit up, but she could not muster the strength to even move her fingers.
	Then the door opens and in comes Twelve, with a bowl of medicine in her hand. Jamie is still in a trance these days, but she is able to swallow and drink small amounts of medicine and water.
	When Jamie opens her eyes, she raises an eyebrow in surprise. Twelve takes out her mobile phone and wants to call Ryan, but thinking that he is off to a residential island now. It’s no difference to tell him when he is back. Then Twelve walks up to Jamie with a bowl and sits down beside her.
	"Are you awake?" Her voice is mild. Jamie turns to look at her with doubt.
	The color in her eyes surprises Twelve. What kind of that look is?
	It’s blank and pure, with a trace of doubt, but very clear, just like a newborn baby.
	"Who are you? Where is this?" Jamie can't move. Ryan has been medicating her for the past few days and her voice is not that hoarse, but she still feels uncomfortable when talking.
	Jamie would have been fine, but last night she had a fever, and after being in the sea for so long, she was so hot and the fever isn’t brought down.
	"You can call me Twelve. You don't have to know where this is." answers Twelve. She turns over the medicine in the bowl with a spoon.
	But what Jamie says next surprises Twelve.
	"Then... Who am I?" Jamie's eyes are watery and innocent, looking at Twelve with a look of unease and emptiness.
	Twelve drops her spoon back into the bowl. She looks at Jamie in surprise and stares at her carefully, not letting go of anything.
	Did she forget everything? Or is she acting?
	Twelve’s eyes look a little complicated, and she stops stirring the medicine because Jamie's eyes are pure and clean, and she is not acting.
	Jamie was rescued with a bruise on her forehead, which might have made her lose her memory.
	But... Twelve has to be careful. She gives Jamie the medicine and watches her, but she doesn't see anything wrong.
	Jamie’s attitude towards Twelve is a bit of resistant, which is a normal reaction when meeting strangers.
	But when Twelve calls the doctor to examine Jamie, it turns out that the bruise on her forehead does cause a temporary loss of memory, although it's not clear when her memory will recover. It could recover in half a month, or not forever.
	Twelve is relieved and then sees the doctor off. She sits down in front of Jamie.
	Jamie is still a little wary of Twelve, but seeing that she isn't going to hurt her, it makes her less defensive.
	"I'll tell you who you are." Twelve tries to lower his voice so as not to frighten her, then says, "Your name is Jamie. You are my master's fiancée, and you lost your memory when you fell into the sea for a mission."
	“Who is your master?” asks Jamie, taking Twelve’s words with a grain of salt. It's impossible for her to believe what she says.
	"His name is Ryan, and you love him very much, and you made a pact that when this assignment is done, you would get engaged." Twelve smiles a little palely, and as she looks into Jamie's clear eyes, somehow a sense of guilt rises in her heart.
	Jamie is skeptical about what she says, but she is shaken by the sincerity of Twelve's words and the way she looks at her sympathetically.
	But although she lost her memory, she is not a fool, without evidence, how could she believe it?
	"If he really is my fiancé, why isn’t he by my side when I wake up? Besides, I don't remember anything about it." she says, frowning.
	Remembering something, Twelve puts down her bowl and walks to a table in the room with a framed picture of Ryan and Jamie.
	This is a photo of Jamie and Ryan in the UK. There's only one of them, but Ryan keeps it in this room like a treasure.
	Twelve holds the frame in front of Jamie, and tells her, "This is you and him."
	Jamie couldn't move and could only stare at the picture, but the girl in the picture with a fresh smile is indeed her.
	Jamie looks down at Twelve with a complicated look in her eyes. "Am I really this man's fiancée?"
	Twelve feels relieved when she sees her finally believes her. It’s fine to kill, but she would feel guilty when lies to such a pure girl.
	But twelve will feel even more guilty if she doesn't lie to Jamie at this point and gains her trust. 
Chapter 387: Why Don’t You Like Her
	Compared to Ryan, Jamie is not important after all.
	"Yes." Twelve says with certainty, and her eyes are sincere.
	"And you are?" Jamie bites her pale lips and looks curiously at Twelve.
	Twelve knows that she wants to ask who she is.
	"I am his sister, and I am yours as well." she says softly, with a friendly smile.
	The resident island is already in a mess.
	It is late at night, and the islanders are asleep. No one has noticed that so many people have crept into the island.
	At night, the Jones family is brightly lit and conspicuous in the dark.
	It is bright and clear in the magnificent dazzling hall.
	Dan stands up, reaches out a friendly hand to Caro and smiles at him. "Thanks for your cooperation."
	Caro also shakes hands with him, much less dandy than usual. "You're Jamie's friend, I'll do you a favor," he says.
	Dan raises an eyebrow. Why, he thinks, does the Caro send someone to contact him soon after he enters the island? It turns out to be because of Jamie.
	It's just that he feels like his baby Jamie is being targeted.
	"Thank you, Mr. Jones." Dan curls his lips slightly, his cold face looking calm, and his black eyes so deep that no one can know what he is thinking.
	Caro pauses and wonders, "You thanked me for Jamie? Why thank me for her?"
	He has a bad feeling, but Caro till asks Dan, and if he doesn't hear the answer, he wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.
	"Doesn't Jamie tell you?" Dan looks surprised, then slowly says, "I'm her husband."
	Husband, husband?!
	Caro's eyes widen as Dan says this. He is clearly too stunned to speak.
	A touch of hurt and gloom creep on his handsome face, but Dan doesn't miss the look and keeps calm.
	It’s lucky that he has married his baby Jamie. Otherwise, he would have had a hard time with all the people who are fond of her.
	After that, Caro tries to ignore the feeling of loss and sadness. Even though he tells himself that he doesn't like Jamie, he is...
	Why doesn't he like her?
	He couldn't even make up a reason for not liking her.
	Unexpectedly, she is already married, which no doubt deals a blow to Caro.
	He may be a dandy on the surface, but if Jamie is his first love...
	"Oh, we have a son who is four years old." As if he doesn’t think it a blow to Caro, Dan continues.
	The shock is even more devastating for Caro than the fact that Jamie is already married.
	Originally, he thinks it is not a big deal to get marry, but hearing what Dan said, he lost all the hope.
	Caro suddenly smiles like a playboy and says, "Aren't you afraid that I won't help you because of this?"
	"You won't. You are Jamie's friend and you won’t hurt her" Dan looks at him seriously. Sometimes you can tell who is a bad guy at a glance.
	Since Caro took the initiative to find him, it is probably because Jack has sneaked into the island, but Dan meant to find Caro before he came to the island. After all, it is his territory, so it would be much easier to find Jamie, which would save a lot of unnecessary troubles.
	He thought it would take a lot of efforts, but Caro agrees him immediately.
	It's because of Jamie.
	Caro's eyes flicker slightly, and he says a little dully. "Do you know her well?"
	Although Caro is reluctant to admit it, it is true that the man is cold and handsome, and he has the aura of awe and dignity.
	He has the maturity and poise that Caro has never had. Jamie would pick him, well, it must because he is so handsome that Jamie feels ashamed to be with him!
	Thinking like this, Caro finally feels much better.
	"What are you thinking about?" Dan doesn't answer him, but asks. His black eyes flashing with a playful smile.
	Caro has the look like someone has robbed him of tens of millions of dollars. He waves and says, "I see. I'll call the island defense department right now."
	"Thanks a lot." Dan smiles faintly and nods to him. After all, Caro has promised to help him and he cannot stimulate him anymore.
	Caro must be disappointed hearing Jamie has been married. He can’t bear more blows now because he has lost hope by hearing the news.
	"By the way, when you meet Jamie, please send her a message for me. I miss her so much." Caro suddenly remembers something and says to Dan's back.
	Dan's back is stiff. Cold and displeasure can be seen through his stiff back. He neither agrees nor denies, and quickly leaves Caro's sight.
	After leaving the Jones family, Derek sent him a message that Jack has been rescued and has left the island.
	Dan isn't surprised, just curls his lips slightly and says, "Don't go chasing him."
	"Master, but if you miss it this time, Jack will be more on guard. And it will be more difficult to find him..." Derek looks puzzled. Their men have already gone after him. It is only a matter of time before he catches Jack.
	"A fox will not show its tail without a spanking." Dan looks at the blue night sky and says, "Have you finished the task I ordered?"
	Derek suddenly remembers what Dan has told him. He nods and replies, "I have finishes it."
	"Good." Dan's cold face softens, and then he begins to lost in thought.
	"Master, since Jack has fled, should we inform Mr. Caro?" Since Jack is not in the resident island, they don’t need Caro's help now, so there is no need to bother him.
	But, to Derek's surprise, Dan shakes his head.
	"Since Jack escaped here, it proves that this place must have something to do with Night.9. If Caro helps us keep an eye on him, it will save a lot of troubles." A touch of shrewdness flashes by Dan’s eyes.
	Since Caro misses his little wife so much, why doesn’t he find something for him to divert his missing for his wife?
	"Yes." Derek answers without further questions.
	On the other side, when Ryan rescues Jack, he takes him to the base of the forces and places him there.
Chapter 388: I Am Your Fiancé
	That's where they have the strongest forces, and there's no danger for Jack being there.
	"Ryan, here you are." When the people in the base see Ryan coming back, they greet him. They are all the former forces of the Gilbert family and assistants to Night 9. After all, Night 9 is not the successor of these forces, so they just call him "Ryan".
	Ryan nods slightly, his face is still gentle, but less bright, and a little colder and bloodthirsty.
	Jack follows Ryan and keeps looking at this place, with a touch of greed, selfishness and calculation passing through his eyes.
	It’s the first time Jack came here.
	Although he is in charge of Ryan, he does not have a clear idea of his influence. Although he would like to replace Ryan, he cannot find the opportunity.
	He knows that these people would not listen to anyone casually. As long as he holds Ryan's lifeblood in his hand, he is not afraid to disobey him.
	As soon as he gets what he wants, let alone these forces, even the whole country C will be under his control!
	"You stay here for a few days. They won't find you." Ryan leads him into a room and says in a cold voice.
	He snorts at Ryan, not feeling embarrassed by living in other’s place and says, "Now that you've found Jamie, bring her to me as soon as possible. I really miss my daughter."
	A look of disgust flits across Ryan's eyes. He knows that Jamie is not his daughter, but he still pretends he really misses her.
	"I have said that she is very ill now. When she recovers, I will bring her to you." His voice is impatient, showing no respect for Jack.
	“Well, what does it matter to me when she's ill? You must bring her to me now, even if she's dying!” Jack can't wait any longer!
	He has to see Jamie right away and gets that thing, or all his years of calculation would be in vain.
	Ryan gives him a cold look, says nothing, leaves the room and closes the door.
	"Ryan." At this moment, a man comes to him.
	"Keep an eye on him."
	Ryan leaves after leaving the words. He takes a phone call and heads back to the villa.
	He gets a call from Jamie, who has woken up and lost his memory.
	He couldn't tell what he is feeling now. He is caught by surprise.
	Jamie has amnesia, and has forgotten everything that happened before, including... that thing.
	Four hours later, Ryan finally gets back to the villa and stands at the door of Jamie's room. He hesitates whether to go in.
	He is afraid to see Jamie's eyes, afraid to see fear, anger and resentment in them.
	But at that moment, the door opens from inside. Twelve comes out and she sees Ryan standing in the doorway looking stunned. "You have come back so soon. Wouldn’t it take some time to be back at normal days?”
	But Ryan's mind is already in a mess, and he doesn't think about why he would settle the things so quickly today.
	Then he says, "She's now..."
	"Just woken up, are you going in?"
	Twelve makes way for him and has planned to go out, but now Ryan comes back, so she should stay with him.
	Although Ryan and her have already talked to each other on the way back, she is still staying with him for keeping an eye on Jamie in case Jamie would doubt him. By the way, she has to keep an eye on Jamie.
	Ryan is so skilled that if even he thinks Jamie has amnesia, there's no reason to doubt it.
	After a moment's hesitation, Ryan enters the room.
	In the room, Jamie has just woken up and looks out of the window sleepily. After a few days of recuperation, she has recovered more or less, but she is so weak that she hardly goes anywhere except staying in the room.
	She is still pallid. After a few days of being ill, her baby fat face becomes thin. With pointed chin, a pair of eyes like two black gems embedded in that delicate small face, she looks delicate and charming. What’s more, she is sick now, her pale look sends out a morbid tenderness, but even more attractive.
	As Ryan enters, Jamie looks out the window with her head tilted against a soft pillow. The snow has stopped and the sky has cleared. The sun shines through the window, melting the snow from the trees and revealing a corner of the courtyard.
	The sun shines brightly after the heavy snow.
	It comes through the bright floor-to-ceiling windows and lands on Jamie's pale little face. It’s not morbid pallor, but the paleness that radiates out of her soul.
	It is as if she has never been in a good mood.
	Ryan’s heart twitching slightly when he sees this. He walks toward Jamie. Before he gets to her, she notices his presence and turns warily to look at him.
	The clarity and bewilderment in her eyes make Ryan exult for no reason.
	He knows Jamie well.
	He has accompanied her since childhood.
	Her thoughts are often reflected in her eyes. From the time when he approached her in the identity of Ryan in the UK to now, her eyes are always stubborn and tenacious, and she never shows such fragile look.
	It's not like her, but Ryan is settling down. Jamie has lost her memory loss. This is the perfect result for him.
	“Who are you?” Jamie looks quietly at the man standing in front of her. He looks familiar, but she couldn’t think of where she's seen him before.
	"I'm Ryan." Ryan walks up to her, his face warm and tender, as if he is looking at someone he loves. "Your fiancé."
	"Twelve has told me." Jamie's face remains unmoved and she doesn't seem interested in him.
	This is a scene Ryan feels familiar with. When he met James the first time, she looked like this.
	After saying this, Jamie doesn't speak again, keeping quiet and disinterested.
	"The weather is fine today. Shall I take you out to get some sunshine?" Ryan isn't in a hurry. He's a doctor, and he knows all about the symptoms of amnesia.
	Jamie looks out of the window and nods.
	In the courtyard, the snow has melted and the warm sun is shining. Bathing in the sun makes Jamie feel very comfortable.
Chapter 389: Trust No One
	Jamie looks better. She looks around and closes her eyes. The sun is shining brightly but not dazzling, warm but not burning. It’s pleasant.
	“You need to head outside and get more sun, which is good for recovery.” Ryan pushes her in the wheelchair to the pavilion in the yard. The servant brews the black tea and he pours her a cup.
	“OK,” Jamie responds and sips the tea, looking at Ryan.
	She doesn’t know the reason but she does feel something wrong with this man and doesn’t want to get close to him.
	“How...how did I lose my memory?” Jamie looks up at Ryan. Although she feels something wrong, she needs an explanation and doesn’t want to live with a blank mind.
	What happened that day comes across Ryan’s mind.
	He jumped into the sea with Jamie that day and was right away saved by his men that had been arranged for them in advance. He can’t forget how she looked at him when he was trying to save her.
	Scared, startled, resentful, and desperate, she pulled herself away from him determinedly and sank into the sea again.
	Her last words to him were “How could it be you.”
	She sounded so desperate that Ryan was blank for a second, and then she sank.
	He knows at that moment Jamie was ensured that he was the mastermind behind all the things.
	Actually she got suspicious while seeing him in the ship. She probably just escaped from the truth and chose to trust him. But what he did in the end confirmed her suspicion.
	After Jamie fell into the ocean, he sent his people in the nearby islands and countries to look for her around the beaches. She was washed up on a beach.
	He saved her, but was afraid, afraid of her questioning and disgusted look.
	He sent the explosive ship. He plotted the kidnap. To stop Dan from taking her away, he even deceived her into jumping into the sea, faking her death in the ship.
	He had been scheming since he was under control of Jack.
	Ryan is scared of looking at Jamie’s eyes. It will remind him of the scene where Jamie shook off his hands and fell into the ocean, which makes him stifled.
	“My special position brings me lots of enemies. To protect me, you got ambushed by them and hit your head, resulting in memory loss.” Ryan looks at her and says affectionately.
	Jamie is less defensive and asks, “Where are my family?”
	“Your family are in France. We will visit them sometime.”
	Jamie nods, tilting her head and looking at him curiously, “Did I love you before I lost my memory?”
	“Yes, a lot,” Ryan answers without hesitation. Although he is cheating, it is worthwhile.
	With a glint of mockery in Jamie’s eyes, she smiles and quips, “No, I guess I didn’t love you. Our marriage should be business marriage.”
	Ryan freezes for a second. Even though she lost her memory, she still can’t be fooled and instead she almost convinces him.
	“Yes. It’s the business marriage. I love you deeply but you don’t.”
	Maybe only when Jamie is in memory loss, can Ryan feel free to say those four words.
	“Oh, you are in one-sided love.” Jamie feels bored these days and gets interested in this topic. “How about me? Did I fall in love with someone?”
	Ryan thinks of Dan but says, “No. But there was a person you did hate.”
	“Who is it?”
	“His name is Dan William. You said he was the man you hated most,” Ryan misleads Jamie with the calm look.
	Dan William?
	Jamie thinks over the name. With no reason, when she hears the name, her heart softens and a strange feeling comes over her.
	Is this feeling hatred?
	“Why did I hate him?” Jamie asks.
	“Because he harmed you, but I don’t know the details. I seldom inquired about your private affairs,” Ryan gives a smart answer to her question and can put her off with that excuse when she asks again.
	Jamie doesn’t know his trick and is curious about Dan William.
	“Do you know why you were ambushed by those people?” With a slight frown, Ryan asks when he notices Jamie’s curious look after he speaks of the name of Dan.
	As expected, Jamie looks at him questioningly.
	“You were looking for something for me and got injured. I’m so sorry.”
	“What is it?”
	“Myth ring.” A seriousness reaches Ryan’s face, but before Jamie notices, it disappears.
	Myth ring?
	Jamie hisses. The two words are familiar but once she thinks over it, her head hurts and seems to be splitting.
	Ryan can tell her headache results from recalling the past and stops her, “Don’t think about it. Let bygones be bygones.”
	After a while, Jamie’s headache is mitigated. She shakes off Ryan’s hands coldly, looking at him contemptuously, “That means, you want me to take that thing for you again?”
	A difference comes into Ryan’s face. He indeed thinks about that, but...
	“Without love between us, I really wonder Why on earth I looked for that ring for you.” Jamie stares at him coolly and says with scorn.
	“Are you really my fiance? Do you truly love me? I doubt it. You must want something from me, right? Thought I don’t know what it is, but I will not be easily used.”
	Though she lost her memory, she doesn’t lose her pride. She is still Jamie Moore.
	She’s not blind. She will find out the truth.
	With a glance at Ryan, Jamie notices an injured look on him. She compresses her lips and goes back to the villa in her wheelchair.
	Jamie can’t remember anything and is completely at a loss. But she is reluctant to trust Twelve or Ryan.
	However, she doesn’t realize as she is in memory loss, except these two that who know her, who else can she trust?
Chapter 390: Don’t Be Afraid
	She goes back to the villa in the wheelchair with unease. The servants are busy in their own things and don’t notice her.
	Walking after her, Ryan doesn’t go forward. He knows Jamie who dislikes him with even memory loss will not easily trust him.
	He is too anxious.
	At the moment an accident happens.
	The servants wipe the china in the villa every day to keep them spotless.
	A servant is wiping the china at the stairwell of the second floor but all of a sudden the china slips and falls.
	Jamie is right underneath passing by.
	“Ah!” The servant is shocked and throws the cloth away. She covers her eyes with hands and is too afraid to see what’s going to happen.
	Bam - Bang -
	The porcelain falls on someone and then drops on the ground. The sound is harsh and clear.
	Then the servant takes her hands away and leans forward to look down. Jamie who would have been hit by the porcelain is safe and sound and held in arms by Ryan. His white shirt is stained with blood but he still holds her tightly.
	Jamie freezes, staring at Ryan’s handsome face close to her. Obviously he’s bearing the pain. How can he stay intact after being hit by that heavy porcelain?
	She didn’t expect him to fend off the china for her especially after she had a dig at him in the yard.
	When Jamie saw the china falling, it was too late and there was no chance for her to dodge. It’s hard for her to move in a wheelchair.
	She never imagined Ryan would protect her with his body.
	She seems to...have seen this before.
	Jamie’s eyes are filled with confusion. She looks uneasy. It seems she can’t hear anything at the point and is lost in her mind.
	“Jamie, don’t be afraid. I’m right here,” Ryan struggles to say something to comfort her thought he himself looks more painful.
	Jamie still freezes and doesn’t even know when the servants have bound up his wounds.
	The servant on the second floor is still numb with shock. With such a huge mistake, she thinks she is going to get killed. But...
	The servant turns to look at the person behind her, and says in terror, “Miss, Miss Twelve, it’s not me, it’s really not me...”
	It was Twelve who had thrown down the china in her hands. It’s not her, it’s really not her. She doesn’t want to die!
	Twelve casts to her a sympathetic look and crosses her arms. She watches the mess downstairs and a smile appears on her lips, “Relax. I will give you a sum of money. You are a big help today.”
	The servant shakes her head promptly, “No, no, no. Miss Twelve, I don’t want anything and know nothing. I will pack up and leave right now.”
	“Ha ha, I like the smart people. Go pack up. See yourself out.” Twelve smiles contentedly and turns to leave.
	With a sigh of relief, the servant thinks she survives, but beyond expectation, when she turns around, someone covers her mouth and nose and takes her away.
	When Jamie comes to herself, she is already waiting outside Ryan’s room.
	Twelve is back to the poker face. When she sees Jamie, she says contemptuously and coldly, “I can’t understand why Ryan saved you. He should have let you get killed.”
	Jamie finds herself back and asks in a low voice, looking at her, “What do you mean?”
	“What do I mean? I have never seen an ungrateful person like you. Do you literally believe you got ambushed because of Ryan?” Twelve says with disdain and anger, “If you were not being willful to take Myth ring, you would not have gotten hurt. What’s worse, Ryan was even involved in it!”
	“What Ryan said is to take care of your feelings. But you distrust him. He should not have saved you!”
	Jamie opens her mouth but doesn’t know what to say. What happened just now convinces her of Twelve’s words.
	She has no doubt about what happened on the first floor.
	How could Ryan plan that right after she made those sarcasm remarks to him?
	Jamie knows it’s impossible and listen to Twelve’s words quietly without retort.
	“Aren’t you eloquent? Why are you quiet now? You should have taken Myth ring by yourself. Why did you get Ryan involved? Please stop being willful!” Twelve sounds a bit desperate in her last words.
	Jamie lowers her head and compresses her lips silently.
	After a while, the doctor finally goes out of the room with a medicine cabinet.
	“Doctor, how is he?” Twelve steps forward immediately. Jamie raises her head and looks at the doctor nervously.
	“Miss Twelve, can I have a moment with you?” The doctor nods slightly and says.
	With a glance at the doctor, Twelve understands what he means and walks away with him.
	Looking at their backs, Jamie can’t hear what they say. She feels puzzled about something but the headache stops her from thinking.
	Perhaps stimulated by the accident, Jamie’s head is aching terribly as if it would burst.
	She holds her head in her hands and bends double in agony, gnawing her lips that are already bleeding but she still can’t stop the headache.
	Twelve and the doctor are talking with their backs to her so they don’t notice her difference.
	It’s a great while before the headache is gone. She’s in a sweat as if she just came out of the water.
	Jamie lowers her arms and lifts her eyes that are clear again. She straightens up and leans on the chair with a long sigh of relief.
	She turns around to anxiously look at Twelve who finished the talk with the doctor.
	“How...how is he?”
	Twelve sniffs and says reluctantly, “Not a big deal. Only a rib is fractured. Luckily the spleen is not hurt.”
	ONLY a rib is fractured?
	That’s not a big deal? Jamie is shocked and can’t understand how Twelve thinks. She looks at the closed door of Ryan’s room, and bites her lower lip, “Can I see him?”
	“You want to go in? What are you going to do in there? To annoy him?” With a snort, Twelve is not as friendly as before. She opens the door, “Go back to your room. I’m afraid when he saw you, he would get annoyed by you again and his wound would get worse.”
	And then, she shuts the door.
Chapter 391: I Just Lack the Sense of Security
	Twelve doesn’t see her. After the door is closed, indifference flashes in Jamie’s innocent eyes.
	She signs and kneads the temple. When she opens her eyes, no emotion can be seen.
	She rolls the wheel chair and then leaves.
	Contrary to Jamie’s room, the main color of Ryan’s room is dark tone with white and black. The falling curtain of red wine keeps the sunshine from outside, making the room dim.
	“This time she will no longer feel defensive about you. Besides, what I said just now will surely make her stand on our side.” Twelve pulls a stool from the side and sits on it unceremoniously.
	The room is so dim that Ryan’s facial expression can hardly be seen clearly. However, it can’t be good because he was hit by such heavy china just now.
	Ryan doesn’t say anything but Twelve can feel anger and unhappiness from his gaze. He is blaming her.
	Twelve snorts and crosses her legs. Although she sits on the stool gracelessly, she gives out an entirely different feeling. She says, “I’m not you, so I don’t have tenderness toward women. More importantly, I told you before and you weren’t against me at that time. So why do you give me such an unpleasant look?”
	“OK, but don’t repeat it next time.” Ryan closes lips slightly and replies in a relatively low voice.
	“When you recover, go on the plan. Don’t forget that the 15th comes soon. Without Jack Moore’s medicine, she’ll die.” Twelve’s voice sounds sentimental, but actually it’s only an illusion. This is one of the reasons that Ryan chose her.
	“I know.” He knows even if he has brought her back, he can’t get rid of Jack Moore’s control without his medicine.
	“It’s good. So don’t do anything that will annoy him, otherwise you’ll suffer the outcomes.” Twelve shakes the head slightly, looking worried in the dim room.
	…
	In the following two days, Jamie is refused by Twelve to visit Ryan for the same reason.
	She is not worried at all. As her body is getting better, she is getting much better despite the fact that it’s still difficult for her to walk and she has to move on the wheelchair.
	Only when Twelve specifically asks the doctor to give her a body check does Twelve find that Jamie is not cheating. She over-suspects Jamie. It’s true that Jamie isn’t able to walk because her legs have been in the seawater for too long which has hurt the bones.
	Since Jamie isn’t able to walk, Twelve is in a good mood because it means Jamie can’t escape. Hence Twelve relaxes her vigilance.
	After being refused to visit Ryan for several times, Jamie doesn’t ask for visit any more. She just stays in the room quietly, which is out of Twelve’s expectation.
	Twelve has thought if Jamie is neglected for some days, she would feel guilty. However, the result is totally in contrast.
	Jamie has come for visit only several times; however, after being refused by her, Jamie keeps herself inside the room. It seems as if she knows what Twelve is thinking about. She is neither conceited nor rash, making it difficult for Twelve to guess.
	Twelve keeps thinking she can catch Jamie if she gives Jamie enough rope. Until the third day, Ryan starts to suspect.
	On the afternoon of the third day, Twelve knocks at Jamie’s door and then finds her seated on the wheelchair. Different from the curtain in Ryan’s room, the curtain in Jamie’s room is fixed on one side, so the warm sunshine casts on her, making her glow like burnished gold.
	When Twelve sees this, for the first time she feels hard to interpret.
	“Miss Moore, Ryan wants to see you.” Twelve says quietly with an unhappy look. She walks behind Jamie.
	Jamie turns her face in surprise and then turns round the wheelchair. She looks up at Twelve calmly but a bit excitedly.
	Twelve snorts silently, thinking that at least she has a conscience and it is worthwhile for Ryan to risk his life to save her.
	Twelve pushes Jamie into Ryan’s room and then leaves without saying anything.
	The wound is on Ryan’s back. Since he is not spoiled and he used to suffer more serious wounds to stand out of the Gilbert family, he is fully recovered after resting for two days.
	When Jamie enters the room, he is tying the tie. On seeing her, happiness obviously flashes in his eyes. He puts on the tie clip, straightens the suit and walks towards her.
	“How’s your wound?” as soon as he stands in front of her, she asks full of worry and care, making him happy.
	He crouches, maintaining the same eye-level as hers. He looks directly at her with gentle attitude, “I’m much better. How about you? Are you comfortable staying here? If not, tell me and I will have others prepare for you.”
	“It’s good.” Jamie bites the lower lip unconsciously, saying “That day… I am so sorry for having said that to you. I just lack the sense of security.”
	“I understand.” Ryan nods. He does know that amnesiacs feel confused about future because of the absence of past memory and so they don’t have the sense of security.
	“Will you help me find my lost memory?” Jamie’s face lights up and a gentle smile flutters over the corners of the lips with hope.
	It’s her first smile during these days. Although it’s a little smile, it’s enough.
	Ryan hesitates for about 2 seconds and slowly gives her a comforting smile, saying, “Don’t force yourself. I’ll help you find your memory step by step.”
	He neither agrees nor refuses. His reply is absolutely brilliant.
	Jamie replies with “ok” and then takes a look at his suit, saying “I wanna take a break outside.”
	“You can do this whenever you want.” Ryan says without hesitation. Jamie won’t be in danger in this villa, so he is reassured.
	An unusual sense appears in Jamie’s eyes. She looks at him surprisingly, “Really? I have been looking forward to taking a break outside for a long time.”
	These words freeze Ryan.
	She means she wants to have a break outside the villa?
	“Jamie, you know it is likely that my enemies haven’t left here, so it’ll be dangerous if you leave the villa ...”
	“But just now you said I can leave whenever I want.” Jamie opens her eyes and looks at him accusingly. How can he eat his words so quickly?
	Ryan keeps silent in embarrassment. He shouldn’t have been deceived by her smile just now. He tries to find something unusual from her face, but what he can find is only the slight sneer.
	She probably thinks he goes back on his word.
	He has to leave Country B for something urgent, or he’ll accompany her out in person.
Chapter 392: I Have Taken a Fancy to You
	After considering for a while, Ryan is defeated by Jamie’s accusing gaze. This is Country B, separated from Country C with a country. And all Jamie’s suspicious objects have been taken away by them. Besides, she’s lost the memory. He is confident even if she didn’t lose the memory, it would be impossible for her to escape.
	Thinking of this, Ryan feels a bit relieved and agrees to her request.
	However, he still has Twelve accompany her in case. Then he leaves Country B by taking the helicopter.
	It seems that Twelve pushes Jamie to have a rest outside, but actually some people are guarding in secret.
	Ryan’s villa is a bit far from the city centre. To satisfy Jamie’s request, Twelve takes her to the nearest city centre and then they get off the car.
	Jamie looks around with curiosity because she’s never seen these strange views before. She asks Twelve curiously, “I’m a local inhabitant? Why don’t I have any impression of this place?”
	“Because you’ve lost your memory.” Twelve has learned to use this excuse to block many of her questions.
	But can she successfully keep Jamie’s mouth shut?
	“Do I have friends here? Can I visit them?”Jamie continues asking.
	“It’s a special period so you’d better not get them into trouble.” Twelve continues blocking.
	“Who has Ryan offended? Do my parents feel really reassured to let him take care of me?”
	“Business marriage. It’s nothing to do with reassurance.”
	Jamie curls her lips and doesn’t deliberately make difficulties for Twelve, but a cunning idea appears in her mind.
	“I wanna eat white rice dumplings with 98 grains of sesame.” She sniffs, looking like a glutton.
	Twelve freezes. White rice dumplings with 98 grains of sesame? What’s that?
	“They suddenly appear in my mind. I guess maybe I used to be keen on eating them? Will you buy them for me?” Jamie turns her head, looks at Twelve with expectation and swallows, making people hard to doubt about it.
	Twelve feels a bit collapsed because Jamie has asked her many difficult questions on the way here. And now she raises such a weird request…
	“All right. Do you want the rice dumplings sold at the store at North St. or South St.? Zhang’s or Li’s?” Twelve curls the lip and asks her immediately.
	Jamie is wily. If she is not as wily as Jamie, she will be dominated, won’t she?
	Surprisingly, Jamie glances at her and says with a little distrust, “Don’t you well understand me? Why don’t you know my favorite rice dumplings? A lack of even one grain of sesame will affect the taste.”
	“…” Twelve takes a deep breath and immediately goes to buy the rice dumplings.
	If Ryan didn’t repeatedly urge her to follow Jamie’s requests, she would have left Jamie alone immediately.
	Without Twelve’s pushing behind, Jamie doesn’t care about sympathy from the passengers-by. Her eyes are cold. She has lost the memory, but.
	She doesn’t like rice dumplings at all. They are sweet and sticky. Actually she likes sweet and sour food.
	This Twelve stands on Ryan’s side, so she has to beware of her.
	All of a sudden, she turns her head and looks around. She purses the lips. There must be more than one or two people around here watching her.
	Jamie rolls the wheelchair forward. It’s unnecessary for her to wait for Twelve here. Since Twelve can find her, why not hang around?
	At the same time, Night 5 and Mone William are searching for her aimlessly.
	Ian only allows Night 5 to take no more than 20 people. Even worse, Dan only allows Mone to take 3 people. Therefore, to look for a person in such a big Country is like to look for a need in the ocean.
	And they are not sure whether this person is in Country B.
	Night 5 and Mone have been searching in Country B for more than a week. From the intention to compete in the beginning to the present situation when they have to mood to complain, they have been good buddies.
	They look for Jamie in the cities along the beaches in Country B. In fact, this is aimless walking rather than searching.
	“Let’s spend all night today in the pub.” Night 5 looks at the shiny sky. The snow has melt, but it’s still a little cold. He is wearing three thermal clothes and a down jacket, but he still feels cold.
	In such weather, it’s better to stay at home with heater. Going outside nearly kills one.
	“Are you a man? You are so scared of coldness.” Mone glances at him, searching among the crowd and teasing.
	“Come on. Aren’t you scared of coldness? My skin is thin, ok?” Night 5 disdainfully looks at Mone who is wearing only two clothes and one of them is a T-shirt with short sleeves. He is green with envy.
	What Night 5 doesn’t mention is that he has pasted warm pastes on the thermal clothes as well. That is to say, he wears more than four clothes.
	If he tells the truth, he’ll be inevitably teased by Mone. Hence, he won’t say so.
	To his surprise, Mone takes a quick glance at the down jacket that is tightly wrapped around him and reveals the truth relentlessly with an indifferent look, “Are you wearing warm pastes inside the thermal clothes?”
	Night 5 freezes and becomes angry. He stares at Mone, shouting “Nonsense! I am a real man. How will I be defeated by such little coldness?”
	His reaction seems that he is trying to hide the truth.
	Mone looks at him with the facial expression that “No excuse. I know the truth.”
	Night 5 is angry. He puts his arms around Mone’s neck, threatening, “Big Ice Cube, I’m sure you don’t have a girl friend. Do you know why? I think you fit men.”
	His words are full of tease. He seems to throw back the teasing words previously thrown to him by Mone.
	“You mean you have taken a fancy to me?” Mone hooks up the corners of the lips. Apparently Night 5’s words have no influence on him.
	“I have taken a fancy to you, so you’ll warm the bed for me?” Night 5 snorts and approaches Mone’s face, but he finds Mone keeps calm without any emotion.
	This makes him boring.
	Hearing his words, Mone smiles a little. His smile is a bit cold maybe because he has stayed with Dan for long and affected by his indifferent attitude.
	However, the point can’t be denied is that whoever stays around Dan has a good looking.
	“Ok. Warm the bed for me next time.”
	“…” Night 5 can say nothing. He is sure men like Mone can only warm bed for males.
	It never happens to him that his word comes true one day.
	“They are so weird. They should talk about such in the day time. Aren’t they …”
	Now they are standing by the road and what they are saying have aroused the curiosity of passengers-by, especially females. They pass them with ambiguous look.
Chapter 393: Acquaintances, Friends and Lovers
	Expression is frozen on their faces for their male dignity’s been badly hurt, especially for Night. 5.
	“Very likely. The boy in blue must be the top, and the down jacket must be the bottom…” Two girls pass by, while one of them is staring at Night. 5 and Mone curiously.
	“Hold it down. They’d get embarrassed if they heard about it.” The other girl can’t help but risk another glance at Night. 5 and Mone, for they are such a handsome gay couple.
	Is it the new norm that the handsome man should fall in love with each other? What’s for the girls then?
	The two girls’ whispering is fading into the distance.
	Shocked to death, the blood is visibly draining from Night. 5’s face.
	Less overreacted than Night. 5 though, Mone gets a bit ashamed.
	“What the…heck! What’s wrong with them? They should think I’m a…a whatchamacallit?” With blush filling his cheeks, Night. 5 is just too embarrassed and angry to speak the shameful word. He’ll never have a crush on men.
	Isn’t it enough for a tough guy like him to be regarded as a gay? How can the girls even assume him to be the bottom?
	It’s Mone who looks like the typical bottom. Are they blind?
	“What’s wrong with their eyes? Even if I was a gay, a tough guy like me should be the top. Dumb bitches! Are they blind?”
	The girls’ words really drive him crazy and he flies into a rage.
	However, Mone’s much more composed. He pats Night. 5’s shoulder and jokes in words of comfort, “You might as well blame the bottom-potency they saw in you.”
	He implies he’s more potent than Night. 5 to be the top.
	Night. 5’s face is darker with another wave of anger. When he’s about to give Mone a slap, Mone suddenly says, “Look!”
	Night. 5 pauses and looks at him impatiently. “Seriously? I’m not an idiot.”
	Mone rolls his eyes and looks at him with distain. “Why should I bother to fool a less potent guy? Look over there!”
	Night. 5 glares at Mone for his words and follows his gaze to the street opposite to them, only to get himself shocked.
	Over there is a woman sitting in a wheelchair. And they recognizes her with her profile.
	She’s Jamie Moore.
	“Holy shit! Big Ice Cube, pinch me to assure me that I’m not dreaming. She, she…” Night. 5 can’t believe it. He thinks he’ll find anyone other than Jamie Moore, but it turns out they make it.
	It must be a hallucination, for it’s too hard to find her.
	Sparing no efforts, Mone pinches him at his request and confirms, “It’s true. That’s Miss Jamie sitting on a wheelchair.”
	Too happy to haggle over the hard pinch, Night. 5’s eyes are glittering with delight as if he’s looking at a gem. “Let’s take her back.”
	He’s walking across to the street.
	Mone immediately grabs him and says seriously, “Don’t you notice the eyes on her in the dark? If we act rashly, they’ll hinder us, not to mention Miss Jamie’s safety.”
	He’s right.
	Night. 5 stops to look around, finding the guards hiding in the dark. What shocks him the most is the unique symbol of Gilbert family on their necks.
	A mark of “G”.
	It means they’re the elites in the charge of Night. 9.
	Son of a bitch! He not only betrays Gilbert family but captivates Miss Jamie.
	Night. 5 gradually calms down, assessing the consequence of his imprudence.
	“We’d better report it to Mr. Dan, for he has been worried about her for a week.”
	Mone lets out a sigh of relief and stares at Jamie, fishing out a micro-transmitter from his pocket and pressing its button.
	Night. 5 nods and looks serious. “Go to tell Mr. Dan. I’ll be on watch.”
	Mone nods, putting away his transmitter, and takes out his exclusive PC of training battalion, sending an e-mail to Dan William.
	Jamie didn’t know Night. 5 and Mone are searching for her. She’s watching a giant screen over the business building across from her, which is playing a sizzle reel.
	It’s an ad about perfume.
	For some reason, she stops and locks her eyes on the screen without moving.
	She isn’t interested in perfume, and she never wears it. Somehow, she thinks the ad’s telling her story.
	It’s a unique romance about a couple.
	The first meet made them acquaintances.
	The second meet made them friends.
	The third meet made them lovers.
	May I trade the three meets with a blissful lifetime with you?
	While she’s reading the words on the screen gently, a scene pops out where a girl in a green dress is walking by a swimming pool.
	Jamie’s shocked. That was…
	Suddenly, the ad is changed into another one as if purposely broken off.
	Passersby stopping for the ad all walks away.
	They all carefully bypasses Jamie to avoid possible blackmail.
	Despite the quick change, Jamie captures the handsome face with glittering eyes like obsidians. And his gaze penetrates her heart the moment he’s coming out of the water.
	He’s such a sight for sore eyes, too stunning to forget.
	Suddenly Twelve shows up. She never expects she’ll come across the ad of Moon Perfume she endorsed. Who’d have ever thought that an old ad could be so attractive.
	“Sorry for being late, Miss Jamie.” She scurries to her, handing her a paper bag. “Here’s the glutinous rice ball with 98 sesame seeds on it. Please check it.”
	Upset and reluctant, she counts them one by one while the chef was sprinkling the seeds, so as to meet her demand.
	Jamie takes the bag, glancing at it, and raises her head with a faint smile. “Forget it. I believe you.”
Chapter 394: Sorry, I Don’t Know You
	“…”
	Seeing her attitude, Twelve finds herself an idiot.
	“Do you want to go to other places? Let me help you.”
	Jamie looks at the ads ceaselessly changing on the screen, feeling a bit frustrated. “I’m tired. Let’s go home.”
	Twelve feels relieved. “Okay.”
	Seeing Jamie’s leaving, Night. 5’s face turns dark. He doesn’t follow them until Mone’s back.
	--
	“Daddy, how could we neglect this country? We’re lucky that Night. 5 and Mone are there, or we couldn’t find her.” Bunny looks at the scenery below the helicopter. Closer they gets to Country B, it gets colder.
	“I’m not sure.” Dan William shakes his head, while his fingers are dancing around on his keyboard, marking several coordinates on the screen.
	Bunny leans over to have a look, only to find several red dots, representing Night. 9’s bases.
	“Daddy, what’re you doing?” Bunny asks curiously.
	“Searching for a man,” Dan replies briefly. He clicks the red dots and maps of coordinated locations pops out.
	What the hell…
	Bunny’s overwhelmed that his dad has not only the coordinates, but also all their maps.
	That is, his dad can get any location he wants.
	Suddenly, it hits him that he’ll have no secrets any more.
	Glancing at his sad face, Dan knows what his son’s fretting over, and he explains with a sneer, “The information was from Night. 1. And I’m not that resourceful to reveal all your secrets.”
	Still, Boss Dan is proud of what Bunny has achieved behind his back.
	Hearing his dad’s explanation, Bunny’s face is lit up again. And he leaves his dad along to work.
	It takes several days to reach Country B by water, yet they still spend almost 24 hours by helicopter. Only at the dusk of the second day do they arrive at the border.
	Gradually falling lightly, days of snow doesn’t settle thick in Country B.
	Ryan Jack’s villa is far from the downtown. So they lands by the villa without worries.
	Not long after landing, Night. 5 and Mone rush out of the villa to the helicopter.
	At a shorter distance are they recognized.
	Once he stops in front of Bunny, Night. 5 hurries to report, “Little boss, Miss Jamie’s in the villa now…”
	Hearing Jamie’s location, Dan and Bunny immediately bolts for the villa.
	Empty and quiet, with everything inside intact, the villa looks like abandoned as if no one lives in.
	Pausing for seconds, they dart up the stairs and searches separately.
	Jamie. Jamie. Jamie…
	With hidden tension, her name echoes in his mind, threatening to penetrate his heart and burst out of his throat.
	Doors flung open one by one, Dan’s glittering gaze gradually dims, tinted with specks of frustration and panic.
	“Jamie…” Walking up to a door at the end of the hallway, Dan kicks open it after seconds of hesitation.
	Bright and warm, the color of azure sky comes into view, which is outshone by his disappointment.
	He closes his eyes and turns to leave the room.
	However, a faint sound of running water stops him.
	The door of washroom opens with a click, and a woman on a wheelchair comes out.
	Dan turns back and gets shocked. He’s about to greet her with surprisingly delight, when she spoils the mood with her words.
	“Are you…the new doctor?” Jamie moves to him, glancing at his clothes with doubt. “You don’t look like a doctor.”
	Not as usual, her gaze is crystal clear with curiosity, which he is unfamiliar with.
	“You…” With the delight in his eyes fading away, he’s choking with shock.
	“Well?” Jamie tilts her head and waits for his unspoken words.
	He swallows and plows his way to her, as if it’s a long tiring walk.
	With hands laced on both arms of the wheelchair, he stands and faces her, looking directly to her face. “You…don’t know me?”
	“Should I know you?” Jamie puzzles her brows and stares at him in wonder.
	The way she looks at her is exactly the same as she looks at a stranger.
	Hurt by her gaze, Dan bites his lips and looks at her with a sneer, with his anger coming to the surface.
	“Jamie Moore, don’t you ever tell me you’ve forgotten your husband?” He stretches out his hand and lifts her chin, with his evil yet charming smile.
	After a short daze, she pulls his hand away, unhappily furrowing her brows. “Don’t mess with me. If you’re the new doctor, sorry, I don’t accept your treatment.”
	“What the heck are you saying?” Dan frowned a bit and found her response strange.
	She used to be too blushing to look at him, but now she just stares at him frankly, which is so weird.
	Amnesia?
	It seems that Jamie has lost her memory as if she is suffering from amnesia.
	“You really don’t know me?” Dan asked her again in a dangerous low voice.
	Jamie tilts her head to think it over, and answers positively, “I’m sorry but I really don’t know you.”
	Dan cups her face and stares at her to find a trace of lying, but there is nothing.
	Jamie bites her lip. “Did we know each other before? Who are you?”
	He has imagined many scenarios to meet her, except one like this.
	Without any hesitation, he stands up and pushes Jamie away out of the room.
	“Damn it! What the heck are you doing? Where are we going?” Jamie immediately grabs the arms of the wheelchair. When she is pushed to the stair case, a little boy is walking up to her.
Chapter 395: How Could He Possibly Hurt Her?
	It’s Bunny.
	Seeing his mom, Bunny lets out a sigh of relief and rushes to her with sobs. “Mummy, I miss you so much.”
	Jamie is overwhelmed and pushes Bunny away. Looking at his chubby face, she retains her passion to pinch it and asks, “Are you sure that I’m your mom?”
	What?
	Breaking out in a sweat, he steps back from Jamie’s hug and pointed to Jamie, looking at his dad. “Daddy, mommy, mommy is…”
	“Your mom has got a problem in her head. Let’s get out of here.”
	Dan says in a dangerous deep voice, for he’s upset about Jamie’s amnesia. Then he pushed her into the lift.
	It’s you who’s got a problem, and so have your family. Jamie groans with complaint, looking around the villa, only to find none.
	Thinking of the words that Ryan Jack and Twelve told her before leaving, she can’t help clenching her fists on her knees.
	Difficult as the task is, she owes it to Ryan.
	…
	After the helicopter leaves, a wall across from the Villa’s door is pushed open, with a secret tunnel behind.
	Twelve walked out to find the villa is quiet.”
	“They have left, and we’re half successful.” Twelve says grimly to the man behind the wall.
	Without any words, Ryan walks out and straightens his suit, putting up a sneer.
	Wondering his deep thoughts, Twelve nudges him by arm. “You’re too cruel to her. If Dan William finds out, she’ll be abandoned.”
	“Just what I want.” Ryan says without remorse, for he doesn’t take her words seriously.
	He’ll take good care of Jamie, if Dan abandons her.
	And he persuades himself it’s the last time to hurt her.
	Feeling pity and compassionate, Twelve says, “If she knows you kidnapped her son in England, she’ll turn her back against you.”
	Ryan bites his lips and looks at her with confusion, for he didn’t tell it to anyone before. How does she get it?
	“Moreover, you pretended to be Hooson to get to her. And the most important is that you set her up to save her. Those are all your schemes.”
	“In disguise of Hooson, you can hurt her, for she’ll hate Hooson instead of Ryan Jack. She’ll hate a scapegoat you fabricated, and you’ll get away with it.”
	“However, it’s you that should be to blame.”
	Twelve elaborated seriously, not so humorous as usual, in a calm voice.
	Ryan didn’t tell her his secrets, but she finds out the truth by herself.
	Never will she imagine that he’s scheming enough to put on quite a show.
	Ryan Jack, Hooson, and Night. 9.
	He’s such an experienced actor that he’s been playing three roles with different characters. He acts like he has a multiple-personality disorder.
	Ryan feels ashamed and cocks his head away. Twelve’s right, he’s the boss behind.
	At the mercy of Jack Moore, he’s gradually lost himself, switching identities so casually.
	He can even hurt Jamie without remorse for his purpose, but he’s still heartbroken for Jamie’s sufferings.
	No, he doesn’t mean it, for he loves Jamie. How could he possibly hurt her?
	He covers his sinister face with his hands, trying to restrain his evil.
	Twelve shakes her head and sighs. Although she works for him not long, she knows him better than anyone.
	Nothing can stop him on his way to the hell.
	--
	In the manor, Dan powers off his mobile phone after answering Secretary Zhang’s call, and temporarily leaves his company’s issues to Bruce and Duke.
	Everything goes as usual, but the storm is brewing beneath the calm surface.
	Dan doesn’t make Jamie’s amnesia public, and only a few know it.
	To recall her lost memory, Wendy often comes around, but it doesn’t work out.
	Coincidentally or not, both Dan and Bunny are out, and Wendy doesn’t show up.
	Jamie gets relieved and walks out of her room. She looks around the hallway, finding no servants, and enters Bunny’s room with nerves calmed.
	And her purpose is to get the Myth ring.
	By chance, she overheard a conversation between Dan and Bunny about the Myth ring hidden in Bunny’s room. All she needs to do is give the ring to Ryan, returning his favor.
	Bunny’s room is tidy with everything ordered and easy to find.
	She walks up to the desk and pulls out the drawer, fishing around in it.
	It’s impossible for him to hide it in a conspicuous place.
	Jamie bites her lip and restores things in the drawer. Then she walks around in the room.
	Bunny’s tidy room is cleaned by himself, for he dislikes others to move his things. And the computer on his desk is the most important.
	Having been searching for so long, she still can’t find the ring.
	Then it occurs to her the most dangerous place is the safest, so she lifts up Bunny’s pillows on the bed, only to find nothing.
	“Where’s it?” Jamie gradually loses her patience and throws herself in the bed, rubbing her neck and looking around, eyes tinted with impatience.
	Suddenly, her eyes are locked on some place.
	She rises to her feet, walks to the desk, grabs the white wireless-mouse and presses its end. There’s something wrong with it.
	She cracks the mouse open, and a black ring drops from it.
	Then she puts the mouse down and picks up the ring with delight. After restoring things on the desk, she leaves Bunny’s room with the ring.
Chapter 396: Why do You Betray Me?
	After leaving Bunny’s room, Jamie walks out of the villa calmly, pressing the button on her necklace. Then she gets on her car in the underground parking lot to leave the manor.
	--
	Escorted by cold wind, Jamie drives directly to the wharf of City A in the leaden sky.
	It’s January, and the Chinese Spring Festival is coming in less than half a month.
	With gloom in her eyes, Jamie touches the necklace. It’s cold outside. She puts on her long white woolen coat and gets off the car.
	The wharf is quiet, for no ships passing by. There are few ships moored to the seashore without people on them.
	Jamie realizes Ryan has cleaned out the wharf beforehand.
	With chill wind against her face, she heads for the appointed place, head drawn in, nose red, and eyes glittering.
	She stops at a unique yet beautiful ship.
	“I’ve got the ring. Come out and take it,” Jamie says to the people inside.
	Then Ryan and Twelve come out of the dark and stop at her.
	With hope in her eyes, she sniffs and says, “I give you what you want as promised, and you should tell me my past now.”
	It’s more of a trade than payment.
	She trades the ring for her past.
	Ryan affectionately gazes at Jamie, a weak girl pretending to be tough, and feels compassionate. “Sweetheart, it means nothing to you.”
	Jamie raises her head, looking at him with confusion, and she’s delicate that Ryan feels protective of her.
	“Where’s the ring?” Twelve tilts her head and feels amused. She wonders if Jamie will kill herself if she recalls her past and finds that she betrays her husband. Twelve can’t wait to see it.
	She smiles and stretches her hand out toward Jamie.
	Jamie bites her lip, debating with herself.
	Seeing her hesitation, Ryan knows she’s ashamed of stealing the ring from a “stranger”.
	It costs Dan William three days to recall nothing in her mind. What a loser!
	Thinking of Dan’s failure, he puts on his smug face with gentle gaze as if drowned in great joy.
	It’s the last time. It’s definitely the last time to hurt her. From now on, he swears he’ll take good care of her.
	Jamie has no choice but to walk to them. And her weakness ignites the fire of confidence burning in Ryan and Twelve, for they have successfully taken control of Jamie.
	Jamie pulls out the black ring from her pockets, which is warmed by her body. However, she hesitates before she gives it to them.
	“Jamie!” There comes a voice bleeding with frustration and fury, shocking Jamie to shiver, and the ring slips out of her hand, falling into Ryan’s palm.
	Sensing the weight of the ring, Ryan finally feels relieved.
	For all the sufferings and schemes, he proves that he’s the winner, isn’t he?
	Trembling as she is, Jamie turns back and looks at Dan’s shocked and disappointed face, drowned in the flood of his sorrow in his eyes.
	With heart aching, she almost chokes to death.
	Ryan quickly holds her staggering body and leaves her to Twelve, staring at Dan with hostility.
	From now on, he’ll spare no efforts to start a fight with him.
	Twelve grabs the ring and looks into it. Although she didn’t see it before, the texture, pattern, and the engraved characters look like true. It’s definitely the Myth ring. And she nods toward Ryan positively.
	It’s the ring he wants.
	Jamie still looks at Dan with shock. The sorrow and disappointment on her perfect face are so deep as if imposed on her soul and heart.
	“You…” She tries to say something, but fails to find the words.
	What to say? To tell him she just borrows it and she’ll return it?
	Jamie thought she’s a bit wrong, but now she finds her mistake is magnified by his glare.
	“Why do you betray me?” He swallows and stares at her, with storm clouds brewing in his eyes.
	“Boss Dan, you’re kidding. It’s not a betrayal as you’re nothing to her at all.” Ryan sneers and moves his arm to Jamie’s waist in the face of Dan.
	In a dark face, Dan counters with a grin, “Ryan Jack, I’m so impressed that you should use a woman to achieve your aim. What a shame!”
	“Shame?” Ryan scoffs. After he left the Gilbert family, he’s done so many shameful things, but he never thinks he’s wrong.
	Except Jamie Moore.
	“Hilarious. Jamie’s willing to do it for me. Ask her if you don’t believe it. Jamie, am I right?” Ryan whispers softly in her ear. His voice’s as tempting as a magic spell controlling her mind.
	Her glittering eyes are replaced by hollow ones without emotion, falling on Dan’s. She says numbly, “It’s my decision. He has nothing to do with it.”
	“Jamie Moore! What the heck are you talking about?” Dan glares at Jamie, who’s fooled by Ryan, and clinches his fists, for he’s so pissed off.
	“Don’t you get it? What a pity! She won’t say it again.” Ryan grins and caresses Jamie’ face, but she’s too numb to frown or dodge, as if she has no soul.
	Ryan takes off his smile and says to Twelve, “Let’s leave here.”
	“Leave? Do you think you’re in your house?” After Dan’s words, a crowd rushes in and besieges Ryan and Twelve.
	And Ryan is shocked to see his men standing by are replaced by Dan’s men. How did they make it?
Chapter 397: He Is Mommy’s Little Guard
	The crowd he brings along is quite big, even bigger than those who have appeared.
	If this is the case, it’s unlikely for them to leave here today…
	As the idea just emerges, Ryan Jack promptly clenches Jamie Moore’s neck with one hand, and grips onto her shoulder with another, with his glance at Dan William intensifying gradually, “If you don’t want anything happen to her, let us go.”
	Twelve doesn’t look too well either. The people they bring along this time are all elites. It would be like a loud slap to their faces if they are really defeated by Dan William.
	But with a bargaining chip Jamie Moore, Dan William will certainly be careful.
	“I detest the most this kind of scums. Bro, let me gun him down!” Bruce Hill, leading a team behind Ryan Jack, loses his nerve immediately as he sees Ryan using Jamie Moore to threaten Dan William.
	The atmosphere intensifies at once. Dan’s grip on Jamie’s neck tightens accordingly. Jamie, her face turning red, is running out of breath.
	Dan presses his lips emphatically, looks at Jamie’s scarlet, suffering face, and spits a few words eerily, “Let them go.”
	“Brother……” Bruce Hill finds this a little intolerable, since when have they been threatened this way? Who dares to threaten Dan William? Whoever did has already disappeared from this human planet.
	Dan took a cold look at him. Only then Bruce shuts up, unwillingly gestures his guys to back off, watching Ryan Jack kidnaps Jamie away from the siege and boards the boat docked by the wharf beforehand.
	Not until the boat disappears from their sight, does Ryan loosen his grip on Jamie’s neck. Jamie finally breathes fresh air and falls limp on the deck. Jamie touches her neck, her eyes blood-shot; she almost suffocates.
	Ryan also realizes he has overexerted, immediately squats down and looks at her, “I’m sorry, Jamie. I didn’t mean to……”
	Jamie can’t help but roll her eyes. The choking has been done. What’s the point of apologizing?
	“What did you just do to me?” Jamie comes back to her senses, remembering the things that have happened just now. Hearing Ryan’s voice, she unconsciously opens her mouth and says something against her will.
	The feeling of not being in control of one’s own body is a terrible feeling.
	She knows that Ryan Jack has excellent medical skills. Does it mean……he has used something to control her just now?
	Ryan purses his lips, picks her up from the floor, dusts her cloths, and says plainly, “Hypnotize”.
	Hypnotize?!
	Jamie’s eyes freeze for a moment. Ryan Jack even knows hypnotization. Does that mean every time after he hypnotizes her, she would do something against her will?
	As she blinks off the worries in her eyes, Jamie looks up at him, “I’ve already given you the thing. Why did you still bring me here?”
	“You saw what was happening. I had to.” Ryan smiles lightly from the corner of his lips, reaching towards Jamie’s hair but she dodged.
	Jamie pretends not to have seen his damaged looks, purses her pink lips, and says, “If you’re so good at doctoring, I hope you help me regain my memory as soon as possible.”
	“Sure.” He replies without hesitation.
	But Jamie’s memory loss should be just what he has hoped for. Why would he dig his own grave and help her regain memory?
	Ever since Jamie acquired the Myth Ring and met them at the wharf, Ryan hasn’t thought of letting Jamie go, nor has he wanted to help her regain memory.
	Jamie is slightly relieved just now, following Twelve to the cabin to get some rest.
	Ryan and Twelve have lowered their guards on Jamie, taking her to their station.
	The location of the station is highly covert, of which the route is impossible to memorise without an extraordinary memory. Even Jamie only remembers the general direction of the route, but not the specifics.
	Twelve has left for a while and returned very soon with panic on his face, “She can’t hold on any longer. Jack Moore hasn’t yet had anyone send medicine.”
	Ryan darts chill through his glance and pulls along Jamie forward in a hasty pace.
	He kicks open the door in front of them, Ryan promptly walks in and finds the people inside tasting tea nonchalantly. Their faces show zero doubt to his sudden arrival; only their gazes seem a little surprised when they see Jamie.
	“Have you brought the thing?” Jack Moore cuts to the chase, directly expresses his ambition.
	Ryan Jack, his face condenses, throw the thing right before Jack, “The thing you wanted. Can I have the final medicine?”
	Jack Moore sees the thing on the table, immediately puts down the teacup in his hand and cautiously holds that ring, astute greed glittering in his eyes.
	This is the Myth Ring.
	Jack Moore takes out a magnifying glass and looks at it bombastically, even though he has never seen the Myth Ring.
	Ryan looks at the ring in his palm with a tinge of sadness, feeling a whirlpool of emotions for a moment.
	If it wasn’t for him, today will not be this scene. He would have done as the madam said, guarding by Jamie’s side quietly. If not for that one time peek at them, he wouldn’t have been found out by Jack Moore and fallen into his hands.
	He has not only betrayed the madam but also handed over the most important thing of the Gilbert family to their enemy. If one day he went down too, how was he going to face the madam and the Gilbert family?
	“This thing isn’t a fake, right?” Jack puts down the magnifying glass and weighs the ring in his hand. The weight is there, but it’s difficult to tell if it is real or fake.
	“You can give it back to me if you don’t want it.” Ryan Jack’s face shows a brush of impatience, reaching to take back the ring.
	Jack Moore doges it swiftly, displaying all the greed on his face and grinning at the Myth Ring in his palm.
	“There you go.” Jack takes out a box from the drawer and throws it at him, “This is the last box.”
	Ryan’s visage relaxes slightly. He opens the box and took a glimpse to make sure the medicine inside is correct. This will be the last time.
	Jamie Moore follows Ryan by his side. At the moment, Jack has been seduced by the power he is going to attain, completely forgotten the presence of Jamie.
	Ryan and Jamie come to a room in the basement. The room is pitch dark with a tiny window not allowing a beam of light.
	Watching Ryan goes in, Jamie reaches the switch by the doorframe and turns it on. The whole room immediately lights up bright as the day. As the room becomes visible, Jamie just begins to check out the place. The whole room is decorated in European style, coloured in light purple, with reliefs of lavender on the opposing walls of the bed. A mild smell of medicine floats in the room; it seems the owner must be in frail health.
Chapter 398: So This is What the Ring is for
	Lingering in thoughts, Jamie has moved to the bed and sees Ryan Jack take out two pills from the box. After a moment of being stared at, Ryan, with a sophisticated look, withdraws the pills and helps the person up from the bed.
	A flash of shock passes through Jamie’s eyes, and instantly calm is restored.
	“Annie, wake up. Your brother is back.” Ryan tenderly speaks to the sleepy Anna Pork and softly pats on her face.
	Anna Pork?
	Then he must be……
	After some time, the lethargic Anna makes a frown, and slowly opens her eyes. When she sees Ryan, she surprisedly holds his arms, “Brother, you’re back?”
	Ryan lovingly rubs her messy hair, opens the box of medicine, and takes two pills, “Come, take this first. You will get well soon.”
	When Anna sees these two pills, she flinches a little unconsciously. But under Ryan’s concerned looks, she hesitates no more, puts the pills in her mouth, and swallows it directly.
	“This medicine will be the last one. You don’t need to rely on his medicine anymore.” The shackle in Ryan’s heart for many years has finally been lifted. He looks at her guiltily.
	Anna shakes her head to mean that she doesn’t mind. But when she looks up, she is shocked, “You, why are you here?”
	She refers to Jamie Moore.
	Jamie blinks twice, looks at Anna with a slight confusion, and says, “You know me?”
	Anna becomes speechless for a moment to her question. She turns to look at Ryan and back to Jamie, with a strange expression on her face.
	“Jamie has lost her memory, so she can’t remember the things in the past.” Ryan explains.
	“Lost her memory?” Anna’s eyes brighten. Does that mean she has forgotten what happened in the past and what she did to her?
	Anna eases back a little. Since she hears it from Ryan, it must be true. The grudge when she first sees Jamie has dissolved as well.
	Before everything happens, she is actually quite fond of Jamie Moore. If she would have a sister-in-law, she hopes it would be her and not someone else.
	“Hi, I’m Anna Pork. Could you be my sister-in-law?” Anna asks Jamie very straightforwardly. Since that time her arm tendon was busted by Mochen Si and Jack More purposely held back the medicine every time, her body has been weak still and her voice faint.
	Being asked directly by someone whom she has never met once or might have met before to be her sister-in-law……
	Jamie thinks the world is a bit messy.
	But Ryan having a sister does surprises her. Does that mean what he did was for his sister?
	“You should know me. I and your brother are only acquaintance.”
	Acquaintance means they’re not even friends.
	Ryan’s eyes dim a little. Has he become an acquaintance rather than a good friend to her?
	“It’s okay. Feeling can be nurtured. How would you know if you won’t fall for my brother in the future?” Anna puts on a lively smile, trying to lighten up the mood.
	“Ugh……” Jamie doesn’t expect her saying that. Suddenly, the handsome face of Mochen Si emerges in her mind, a bit puzzling.
	“It’s alright you lost memory. My brother’s medical skills are superb. He will definitely help you regain memory. Don’t worry.” Anna persuades with kind-heartedly, not knowing her words were like knives stabbing into the heart of Ryan Jack.
	Why on earth would he help Jamie regain memory.
	Jamie purses her lips and pays little attention to Anna’s words. Hearing her mention of Ryan’s medical skills, she sizes up her and asks strangely, “If you brother is so good at doctoring, why would he need to take medicine from that man?”
	That man refers to Jack Moore.
	Anna Pork makes a surprised sound but doesn’t know what to follow up.
	“He poisoned Annie. The chemicals of the poison were mixed by me. It was originally designed specifically for someone. The composition is many and complicated, much more than any other poisons I’ve made.” Ryan Jack swallows his sobs and voices the explanation.
	“I’ve only mixed two portions of this poison and was reluctant to make anymore. But I didn’t expect that Jack Moore stole the list of composition and took the only two portions – one for that person, the other he used it on Annie.”
	Ryan’s eyes drop; he dares not to meet the eye contact from Anna’s solace or Jamie’s curious doubt.
	Because the first portion of poison has been used on her mother, Mira Night.
	Without the composition list, they have taken the poison, and Ryan has no method to prepare an antidote. But who would have thought the result? Jack Moore gave someone the list to make a medicine that counters the poison.
	Ryan has tried many times to detoxify Mira Night but to no avail.
	He’s also tried extracting the blood of Adele Gilbert to analyse the composition of the poison. An antidote was made but once taken by Adele the toxicity increased.
	He could have refused Jack Moore’s spiteful demand. But when Adele was in his hand, if he didn’t answer to him, he would have exposed the information of Adele to those people who participated in the Gilbert family massacre.
	The only task given to Night. 9 by the master of the Gilbert family is to protect the last blood of the Gilbert family with his own life.
	But, it was him who pushed Adele Gilbert to a dead end.
	The last mistake he made was punished on his only sister.
	Maybe this is karma.
	“Since you made the poison, why can’t you prepare an antidote?” Jamie is puzzled, staring at him.
	“It’s not that easy.” Anna says, “If he could, he would have done it long ago. We wouldn’t have been manipulated by other people.”
	Ryan nods silently, tightens his grip, and dares not to look at Jamie’s eyes.
	BANG, WHAM, KAPOW –
	Noises come from the doorway, drawing them to look towards it.
	Jamie looks at the doorway, feeling a bad omen rising from within. She takes a few steps to open the door but is blocked by a hollow iron door.
	Jamie pressed her lips and throws a kick at the door, but the door only returns a dull sound due to its thickness.
	“What’s going on?” Jamie turns to the equally astonished sibling. Ryan Jack startles for a few seconds then bursts into laughter. He stands up, walks over to Jamie, and sees the people waiting outside through the hollow iron door.
	It’s his people.
	“I didn’t expect Jack Moore to use the Myth Ring so quickly and swallow my subordinates.” Ryan says emotionlessly without a tone of joy and anger.
	But Jamie takes in a deep chilling breath. In this way, does it mean they’re completely controlled by Jack Moore?
	“Aren’t these your people? Why are they answering to Jack Moore?”
	“Before the Myth Ring appears, they’re indeed my people and loyal to me. But after the ring appears, these people only answer to the master of the Myth Ring.”
	Jamie comes to a sudden realization. “So, this is what the ring is for” is visibly expressed on her face.
Chapter 399: To Kill Someone
	Ryan purses his lips. He thinks hard. He knows that Jack would dump him now that he has got the Myth ring. But now Anna has been detoxified, so he can no longer sit passively for his end.
	Jack is puffed with ambition. He even wants to annex most of the power of Country C. That means he needs to get rid of Dan.
	In a short time, Jack may not be able to gather the Gilberts' underground forces. Ryan still have time.
	"What should we do?" Jamie kneads her eyebrows. Complex expression flashes across her face. But it quickly returns to its normal when she puts down her hand.
	"What Jack will do next is to ask you to threaten someone." Ryan looks at Jamie, clenches his fists, thinking about the next countermeasures.
	"Me?" Jamie points at herself and widens her eyes.
	…
	As Ryan expected, it doesn't take long before Jack sends someone to take Jamie away. After controlling this place, Jack has no scruples and occupies Ryan's study. At this moment, he was stroking a precious porcelain in the study proudly.
	Jamie is pushed into the study room, and the door slams shut.
	She looks at Jack, who is appreciating the porcelain. She purses her lips.
	Jack puts down the porcelain and looks at Jamie, his shrewd eyes gleaming, "I heard that you had amnesia? And you can't even recognize your real father?
	Jamie chills and doesn't answer.
	"Come and sit down, let's talk." Thinking about his plan, Jack softened his voice. He walks to the black leather sofa in the study and sits down like a loving father.
	Jamie hesitates for a while before walking over and sitting on the solo sofa opposite Jack. She looks indifferent and calm, as if she's looking at a stranger.
	Jack is satisfied with Jamie's reaction. Because it shows that Jamie has indeed lost her memory.
	Jack doesn't know that Jamie already knows that she's not his daughter. Ryan hasn't report to him, Ryan also keeps Johns' contact a secret.
	Jack knows that Jamie is not his kid. That's why he has always neglected Adele and Jamie. He raised Jamie up and bore insult for his plot.
	He has never even touched Adele. How could Adele give birth to his daughter? Jack has different attitudes towards Jamie and Mia, and that's why.
	But he knows very well that he could take advantage of Jamie. Naturally, he will not fall out with her.
	"I'm your father." Jack says, he looks sincerely.
	Jamie is stunned, "Ryan told me that my parents are living in France."
	"He lied to you, I'm not in France, and your mother has passed away, let alone living in France." Jack doesn't hesitate to overthrow Jamie's cognition. His words are half-truth. It is easy to be confused by his words.
	"Are you really my father?" Jamie's eyes widen with a touch of trust and expectation.
	Jack nods firmly and looks at her lovingly, "I know you have gone through a lot, my kid."
	Jamie shakes her head, tears burst out from her eyes. She sniffed.
	"Do you know why Dad is looking for you?" Jack asks.
	"I don't know."
	"Daddy wants you to do something. I need you to kill someone." Jack grits his teeth gloomily, as if he hates that person's guts.
	Jamie shrinks back subconsciously, as if she's frightened by Jack. She doesn't ask until Jack gets back to his normal appearance, "Who is the target? Why him?"
	"That person is Dan. He is our enemy. He killed your mother." Jack says. He stares at Jamie's eyes, trying to catch any abnormal expression.
	However, Jamie is calm, only shows a little surprised when she hears Dan's name.
	Jamie clenches her fist angrily, with anger in her beautiful eyes, "But Ryan didn't tell me that Dan was the one who killed my mother, and I took the ring out of their hands, I'm afraid he already hates my guts. What if he kills me when I go back?"
	"Don’t worry." Jack shakes his head firmly, "It is absolutely impossible for him to do anything to you. Only you can succeed in this action."
	Jamie hesitates, biting her lips and keeps silent.
	"Don't you want to avenge your mother? She loved you so much when she was alive!" Jack pretends to be angry, slaps his thigh, and turns his head away from Jamie.
	"I see, I will avenge mom. Dad, don't worry." Jamie feels pain from her heart, as if a thorn is piercing it.
	Jack relieves, and he nods, "Your mother will be glad in heaven."
	Jamie nods, her throat chokes and couldn't say a word.
	Jack was satisfied. He orders someone to send Jamie back to the room. He didn't expect that Jamie would be much easier to control than before.
	Before Jamie's amnesia, Jamie wouldn't cooperate even if Jack force her with violence. Sure enough, God is helping him.
	Jamie is back to Anna's room. Ryan and Anna immediately come up, take her to sit over and ask, "Is Jack doing anything to you?"
	Jamie shakes her head and repeats what Jack said to her. At the end she angrily curses Dan.
	Anna and Ryan look at each other, feeling complexed.
	Currently, Dan may be the only one who can fight against the Gilberts' underground forces. But if Jamie goes against Dan, it's Ryan's good chance.
	But once this happened, Jamie and Dan could never make it up.
	Ryan feels a faint happiness, but it fades away soon.
	He hopes that Jamie will never regain her memory for the rest of her life. If once she regains her memory and finds what she has done, she may not be able to bear it.
	"Jamie, do you really want to go?" Ryan askes tentatively. He doesn't hope to see Jamie suffer in the future.
	"Of course, isn't it justified to avenge my mom?" Jamie says affirmatively.
	Seeing that she's so sure, Ryan doesn't intend to go on his words.
	Yes, he's selfish. He couldn't let go of the girl he has loved for so many years, even if she has already had a substantial marriage with Dan.
	"Brother, wouldn't it be bad?" Anna whispers to Ryan.
	"What's wrong? It's her own decision."
	Anna shuts up and stops asking. She looks indecisive.
Chapter 400: Are You Dreaming?
	Would Jamie fall in love with Ryan, if Dan is killed?
	The next day, after Jack telling Jamie some precautions, he gives her a bag of powder. When Jamie gets a chance, she would put it in Dan's food or drinks.
	This is a kind of neurotoxin. It is the same poison that Jack used on Anna to threaten Ryan.
	Jack tells Jamie that this would only put Dan out. It would not be fatal. And Jamie believed him.
	Jack is wary of Jamie. He replaced her necklace with a mini locator which could track and monitor. The locator looks the same as a normal necklace, but it can record Jamie's every move.
	After Jamie was sent to Country C, Jack immediately left.
	Not long after, Jamie is taken to the Williams' Manor.
	A few days later, the Williams' Manor is completely locked down. Not even a fly could get in.
	Dan's parents have not awareness to what has happened. Ian stays with them in the Williams' Manor, so they don't feel anything abnormal.
	Dan hasn't appeared in CR for several days. Duke and Bruce feel something is wrong. But Dan has told them not to enter and leave the manor at will during this period, so they didn't make any move.
	Spring comes in City A. It is getting warmer day by day.
	Earth-shaking changes have also taken place in the Williams' Manor.
	Jamie stares at the fallen figure in front. Her body is trembling violently, and her clear eyes are filled with pain.
	The others in the manor had been quietly resolved by Jack's forces.
	Dan seems to be asleep, his eyes close tightly, his pale handsome face has lost his vitality. He was smiling at her a moment ago and complimenting her good cooking skill. But the next moment after eating the food, he fell down.
	Jack eliminates Dan's force in one fell swoop, taking advantage of this chance.
	Jack has waited for a long time. After all, his current power is no better than Dan, otherwise he doesn't need Jamie to poison Dan. Ryan’s force is secretive. It's impossible to take the initiate to find out.
	That's why Jack has to be more cautious. He shows up only when he saw Dan fall down after being poisoned.
	He's almost succeeded. Without Dan in his way, he could take charge of most power of Country C.
	"I've been waiting for this day. I've waited for a long time." Jack mutters to himself, looking at the huge manor. Ecstasy and excitement fill his heart.
	Jamie regains her sense when she heard Jack's voice. She yells at him, "You lied to me! You said it is not fatal. Look at him, why is he dying?"
	Her eyes are red, she's too stubborn to tear. She looks at Jack accusingly.
	Jack's goal has been achieved, and Jamie is useless to him. He sneers, "I didn't force you to believe me. He's dead, and you killed him yourself."
	You killed him yourself.
	These four words make Jamie's pupils shrink. She puts down her hands pointing at Jack, staring at her hands blankly.
	"I...killed him?"
	"Yes, you killed him, you killed him with your own hands, it has nothing to do with me!" Jack laughs as if it's not damages to Jamie. He repeats viciously.
	As soon as Dan died, Jack no longer needs to stay in that horrible place. Not only the Moores, but also CR would soon become his possession.
	"It's not me, it's not me!" Jamie shakes her head which is almost torn apart by Jack's voice. She covers her ears to not listen to him.
	"Are you sad to see him die?" Jack shows no intention to stop. He walks to Jamie with a twisted face, and says gloomily, "Do you know who he is?"
	Seeing Jamie's stunned look with pain, Jack feels his suffer in the past paid off. Adele refused to hand over the secret ring. After all, he obtains it. And he's torturing Adele's daughter.
	Haha, it's really funny.
	"He is your love, your husband!" Jack says clearly, seeing Jamie's astonished expression, he couldn't help laughing.
	"If your mother handed it over earlier, this would not happen. Your mother caused all of this. She's the one to blame." Thinking of the noble and elegant figure, the hatred in Jack's eyes grew stronger.
	Perhaps he has ever loved Adele. But in the end, the desire towards power wins.
	"From now on, these things belong to the Moores." Jack looks around the manor and says with madness. His greed seemed to be running out.
	"Are you dreaming?" A cold voice sounds from behind him, with a hint of sarcasm and disdain, as if mocking Jack.
	Jack is startled and turns around subconsciously. His eyes widen as if he has seen something incredible.
	He sees that Jamie is supporting Dan, who has fallen on the ground, to stand up. Moreover, Jamie is looking at him coldly. There's no trace of confusion in her watery eyes.
	Her temperament is noble and elegant. There's no trace of trust towards Jack in her eyes, only fierceness.
	"When did you regain your memory?" Jack didn't expect Jamie to regain her memory. But soon he calms down. His force has taken up here, so he doesn't need to panic.
	Jamie tilts her head as she's thinking. She smiles, "Ah...I don't remember."
	After speaking, she shrugs and looks innocent.
	Dan caresses her hair fondly and smiles, "Are you waiting for my compliment that you almost deceived me successfully?"
	Jamie smiles. She started to regain her memory on the third day after waking up. But did she dare to say it?
	No, she didn't.
	Because Ryan wouldn't let her steal the Myth ring, let alone let her leave.
	If it wasn't for what happened on the sea, she would not be able to see Ryan's real color.
	Her necklace was also taken away by them and replaced with a monitor necklace. Ryan and the others would see her every move. She did not dare to tell Dan and Ian that she has regained her memory.
	At the beginning, even Dan was deceived by her. But he discovered the clue when she unconsciously pursed her lips.
Chapter 401: You Already Knew
	What happened later was just as Jamie and Dan expected. Ryan took her away and led her to see Jack. They have expected that Jack would use Jamie to poison Dan.
	However, they did not discuss too much because Jamie was under monitoring. Their mutual trust helped them to get here.
	At the other end, Ryan, who is watching through the necklace, is silent.
	Anna pouts, she's unhappy, "Brother, are we leaving here?"
	Sure enough, Ryan leaves leeway for him. His secret forces have taken back this campground again. He was waiting for Jack's return to act.
	But now it seems that Jack will never come back.
	"No." Ryan watches the screen. His gaze becomes firm and even smiles as he looks at Jamie on the screen.
	Jamie looks at Jack, she has a great impulse to roll her eyes.
	What a shameless person!
	"Darling, let's throw him into the sea to feed the sharks, okay?" Jamie nudges Dan, staring at Jack, and says mercilessly.
	"That's too much work to throw him into the sea. There're sharks in the manor." Dan chuckled. There's a deep pool that keeps two small sharks.
	"..." Jamie is speechless, she didn't expect there're sharks in the manor.
	Seeing they discuss about how to kill him, Jack becomes angry. He waves at several subordinates besides and issues orders, pointing to Jamie and Dan, "Catch them, dead or alive!"
	Seeing Jack is wearing the Myth ring, so the subordinates stepped forward without hesitation.
	"Darling, ask your people out and beat them up." Jamie hides behind Dan and says, winking her watery eyes.
	"Don't worried, your dear husband is here." Dan glance at those subordinates, stretches his body with a faint smile. It looks like he isn't worried at all.
	Jamie hides her face from shyness. Her face turned red when she heard Dan's word.
	Those subordinates are elites from Jack's side. Jack is confident that the seven persons can beat up Dan.
	But Dan is powerful. Those subordinates are nothing to him. Even though he's fighting with his bare hands, he doesn't fall behind.
	Jamie watches at the side. Her heart is beating fast, as if it's about to jump out of her throat. She clenches her fists as she fixed her gaze at Dan.
	Dan moves very fast and neatly. He takes some efforts to finally beat up seven persons.
	Jack's angry and embarrassed. Seven subordinates are not powerful enough to defeat Dan. What a shame!
	Jack realizes that it couldn't be delayed any longer. The longer it takes, the worse the situation would be. So, he signals people in the dark to aim their pistols at Jamie and Dan.
	"I told you long ago that you would regret going against the Moores." Jack looks at Dan, smiling triumphantly and hideously. As long as he makes a gesture, those people would shoot.
	"Is that so?" Dan watches Jack with mocking smile, mocking Jack's over-confidence.
	Jack is provoked by Dan's gaze. He turns into a hideous expression. He waves his hand and makes a gesture without hesitation.
	"Kill them!"
	Dan and Jamie lean on each other. They are now two living targets.
	Jamie grabs Dan's clothes, bites her lip and looks at the people in black around them, swallowing subconsciously. She looks up at Dan, only finds that Dan is unexpectedly calm. His dark eyes contained wisdom. It looks like everything is under his control.
	Seeing Dan's expression, Jamie feels peaceful. She tugs Dan's clothes.
	Feels the tug, Dan slightly squeezes her hand and sends a hint to her.
	In the next five minutes, the huge and bright hall is extremely quiet. No sound was made.
	Jamie is surprised. Those people did not shoot.
	Jack's expression changed. He couldn't believe it. So, he signals and shouts again, "Kill them! Shoot them!"
	There's only endless silence----
	"What?" Jack is completely stunned. He turns his head to look at the elites he brought. Although they maintain the posture of raising guns, they are clearly not the ones he brought!
	"When did you change my subordinates?" Jack glares at Dan. Anger fills his chest. He feels a bad heartache.
	Dan glanced at the people around Jack. Yes, Dan's subordinates have replaced Jack's.
	"When you came in here." Dan answers.
	Since Jamie has regained her memory, it is impossible for Jamie to poison him. In that case, Dan would naturally not allow Jack to come in so easily.
	This is called sugar coated bullets.
	Jack is ambitious and courageous, but he's not smart enough. It couldn't be easier to deal with such people.
	Jack steps back. As soon as he retreats to the door, Dan makes a gesture which comes with the sound of bullets being loaded. Hearing this, Jack freezes.
	Knowing that he was fooled, Jack regrets. He thought that Dan's death was already a certainty. But it turns out that Jamie has been laying to him!
	Although he holds the Myth ring, he has nowhere to find the power of the Gilberts’ forces. It is impossible to defeat Dan with his current force. If Dan has been poisoned as he planned, then he would have succeeded!
	Jamie ruined his plan!
	Jamie has pushed him to an abyss!
	"Daughter, my dear daughter, I am your father, are you going to watch your husband kill your father?" Jack looking at his last life-saving straw, his shrewd and greedy eyes are filled with desperate.
	After consolidating for every step for so many years, Jack’s not reconciled of failure. He hasn’t enjoyed any rights and fortune brought by the Myth ring!
	Jamie sneers and looks at Jack. Coldness fills her watery eyes, "Jack, my biological father is in France, and his name is not Jack Moore."
	Jack's body trembles. He looks at Jamie in surprise, "You already knew!"
	This is a scam! Jamie has long known that her biological father is not Jack. That’s why Dan didn’t even take Jamie into consideration when he suppressed the Moores merciless.
	Damn, Ryan has been monitoring Jamie at all times under his order. But Ryan didn't report such an important issue!
Chapter 402: Smart Boy
	Jack's complexion gradually became savage and distorted, as if he’s under great anger, but there’s nowhere to vent.
	"Did I say that I didn't know?" Jamie blinks innocently. Watching Jack collapsing, she feels happy. But this’s just the beginning. Jack will pay the price for what he has done on Jamie’s mom.
	"Bitch!" Jack grits his teeth and glares at Jamie. Jack has not countermeasure. He left with more than half of his force but forgot to leave a leeway for himself.
	Dan smiles, faint mockery appears in his black eyes.
	Jack's defeat was because he’s too arrogant. If he joins hands with Ryan, he might have some chances to win. Ryan is more thoughtful and proficient in tricks than Jack.
	Ryan used Jamie to get the Myth ring for Jack. He plays three roles without being noticed. It has proved his endurance and perseverance.
	In fact, Jack's biggest trump card should be Ryan, not the Myth ring.
	His fault was that he dumped Ryan after using him.
	"Catch him." Dan says to his subordinates. He caresses Jamie's hands, feeling its warmth and softness.
	Jack clings to the door. When he hears Dan's words, he tries to open the door and run.
	However, at this time, the door opens from the outside.
	"Why there’s nobody working out there?" Amelia's voice sounds, with complaints and doubts. The manor is very large, and there are always servants cleaning and patrols patrolling.
	But today, it’s so quiet and there’s no one, which made her feel very strange.
	Amelia bumps into Jack who’s trying to run out. Jack knows Amelia is Dan’s little sister. A thought flashes in his mind. He rushes to Amelia in the next second and stuck his pistol against her head.
	Seeing this, Dan’s subordinates stop immediately. They look at Dan for instructions.
	Dan and Jamie are shocked. They have never expected that Amelia would come over at this time.
	Dan lets Ian stays at the main house so that Dan’s parents would not come over and see this. But Dan forgets Amelia.
	Amelia’s neck is surrounded by Jack's arms, which makes her face pale. Even her handbag falls to the ground.
	All Amile wanted was come and get closed to Jamie so that she could carry out her own plan. How could this happen?
	"Stay away, step back!" Jack presses his pistol against Amelia's temple as he says fiercely.
	Amelia’s so frightened that her legs become weak. She looks at Dan with fear and pleading.
	Dan frowns, and says solemnly, "Stay back."
	His subordinates return immediately.
	Jack looks proud. He sighs with relief and thinks, “Even God is helping me. Now I have an ace in hand, I have nothing to worry about.”
	"Prepare a car for me immediately, and 10 million in cash, let me get out of here!" Jack takes the opportunity to make a request. He has the Myth ring, as long as he leaves here, he could figure out how to defeat Dan.
	“Fuck.” Jamie mutters as she suppresses her impulse to throw her shoes to hit Jack.
	Jamie clenches her fists and turns around to look at Dan. It would be difficult to catch Jack once he flees. But Amelia's life is more important.
	"I will count down to three. If you don't agree, I will shoot her immediately!" Jack pulls Amelia's hair fiercely and forces her to hold her head up so that they could see Amelia's appearance.
	"Brother, help me..." Amelia looks at Dan with panic and fear. She can barely breathe as Jack grabs her throat tightly.
	"Okay, I agree." After thinking for a moment, Dan agrees. Then Dan orders a person to drive the car out of the garage and another to withdraw 10 million.
	Amelia's eyes turn red. After all, she has been protected well since she was a child. The biggest difficulty she has faced was when she was locked up for several days. She has never encountered such a fatal moment.
	It freaks her out. “I am too young. I haven’t told Derek I like him. I haven’t let Jamie to pay her price. I don’t want to die yet.” Amelia thinks.
	Jack lets go of Amelia's hair. But the pistol is still resting on her temple. He watches the surroundings vigilantly.
	About fifteen minutes, the two subordinates return and hand a box and car keys to Dan.
	"What you want is here. The car is ready. Let go of my sister." Dan puts the box and car key on the table. Looking at Amelia's painful expression, his eyes turn cold.
	Jack is now more alert to them, instead of walking to take the items, he says, "Open it, I need to check."
	When the box opened, there’s 10 million in cash.
	Jack glances at the table and then walks over with Amelia. He orders Amelia to pick up the items as he presses the pistol against Amelia’s head.
	On the exact moment that Jack takes the box, a cold light flashes in Dan's eyes Dan emerges in front of Jack. His long legs hit Jack's wrist. Jack feels a pain on his wrist and the pistol falls to the ground.
	Jack realizes it’s no going well. He immediately pushes Amelia to Dan, turns and runs out of the door.
	"Catch him." Dan holds on to Amelia and orders in a cold voice.
	Jack runs out of the villa and sees the car. He goes in and starts the car.
	He drives forward desperately in fear of being caught.
	The manor is large, and it takes him a while to arrive at the front door. The iron door is closed. If he went down and opened the door, he would be overtaken by Dan.
	Jack grits his teeth and puts up his courage. It’s time to take a risk. Then he speeds up the car and rushes towards gate!
	Wham ——
	There are two loud noises. Then Jack finds that the car could not move.
	Jack opens the car window and looks down. A small circular hole appears in the tire. Obviously, it’s a trace of bullet.
	Who is it?
	Jack looks back. It’s impossible for anyone to catch up with him. Could there be someone lying in ambush?
	"I said, we can never let down our guard in front of scums."
	The voice is soft and cute. It sounds helplessly. But the cold tone makes a cold sweat burst out of listener’s back.
	"Smart boy. What a brilliant idea to stay here and wait." Night. 7 says, looking and wanting to knead Ian’s soft plump little face.
Chapter 403: The Best Heir Candidate
	Jack looks towards the voice origin, he sees a little kid who is standing beside a woman wearing tight black clothes, wiping his cherished silver mini gun.
	This kid... Shot the bullet?!
	“Who are you?” Jack looks at bunny's little face, it feels quite familiar, like he has seen him somewhere.
	“He doesn’t know who I am? The news in A City spreads so slow?” bunny turns his head and looks at Night. 7 disdainfully.
	Night. 7 purses his lips, “Of course not, he's just ignorant, so he doesn't know you, bunny.”
	“That's right, how could anyone not know a cool kid like Me.” bunny slightly smiles, his big eyes seems like covered by frost and snow, flashing the cold light right upon Jack.
	Jack looks at bunny's face clearer.
	That face……is clearly Dan's, could this kid be Dan's kid?
	Only then, Jack remembers the news he read last time, Jamie and Dan's kid is called…Ian.
	“There!” sounds of people are heard from the back. Jack immediately looks back, those people are already catching up.
	Jack doesn't have much time to think, so he gets off right away. He looks at the tightly closed big door with the height of three adult, climbing out is impossible.
	There's only one way.
	Jack turns away, looking at bunny's position with hatred, he completely forgets who broke the tire just now, and quickly runs over with fierce expression.
	Even if he had to die, it'll be worth it if Jamie and Dan's son die too.
	He seems to be completely ignoring Night. 7's existence.
	Before he gets closer, Night. 7 quickly takes a gun out, precisely shoots at his belly, bunny says that he shouldn't die so easily.
	Jack stops walking, the wound on his stomach continuously bleeds, he lowers his head to take a look, and the gun in his hands falls to the ground while he falls on his knees.
	“A violent women won’t be able to get married.” bunny shakes his head like he's sighing, but it doesn't look like he pities her, instead it looks a bit like taking pleasure in her misfortune.
	“Aren't you able to support me? Then why should I get married?” Night. 7 turns her head and takes a look at bunny, then blows the gun elegantly before putting it away.
	Jack's mouth is wide open, he looks up at Night. 7 unbelievably. That turn made Jack coincidentally looks at Night. 7's neck. There's a letter on his neck, the same symbol as the one in the myth ring.
	“You, you're one of the Gilbert family.” Jack's eyes starts to glimmer with hope, he stares at Night. 7's neck, this big surprise covers the pain from his wounds.
	Night. 7 doesn't deny it either, Jack is going to die anyway, “Yeah.”
	“I, I'm your master, you must listen to me!” Jack strenuously takes the myth ring out and lift it up so Night. 7 can see.
	Night. 7 is so skillful, if he could take her to his camp, then he'll just need to confront Dan to win.
	However, the fact has proven that, his thoughts are too good to be true.
	Night. 7 catches the sight of the myth ring in Jack's hands disdainfully, then she says something that makes Jack crumble, “You believe that the worn out ring is the myth ring? Does someone like you deserve to hold the myth ring? Let alone that the ring you're holding is a fake, even if it's really the myth ring, we won't listen to your orders either.”
	Myth ring indeed has a decisive function, and they must listen to the orders of the one who possess the myth ring.
	But if everything links to bunny, then they’ll also be perfectly happy to listen to his orders even if there's no myth ring.
	Not only the Gilbert family's blood flows in her veins, she's also extremely intelligent, she’s the best heir candidate.
	“What? It's a fake?” Jack looks at myth ring he's holding in shock, no wonder he can't find where the rest of the power is, there's no information at all.
	It turns out that it's a fake!
	He planned every step cautiously for so many years, and it’s unexpectedly a fake one?!
	Damned Jamie, damned Dan, they fooled him so miserably!
	He absolutely won't let them go! Absolutely!
	There's a red streak in Jack's eyes, he catches a glimpse on the fallen gun on the floor, and takes it with no hesitation. He aims at bunny, his face twists while his heart shouts "go to hell!”
	Then he pulls the trigger, he shoots bunny.
	“No!” Jamie and Dan who are running together to this place sees it, their heart clutches. Right before Jack shoots, Jamie throws herself and hugs bunny tightly.
	Bang——
	The bullet didn't hurt bunny at all, but it shot the back of Jamie's shoulder, fresh blood spurts out, quickly painting the white knitted outer garment red.
	Luckily, Night. 7 already injured jack, so his shot wasn't accurate, and it didn't hit the critical point.
	Dan's pupil tightens, and then he shoots both of Jack's arms without any hesitation.
	Fresh blood splatters, Jack's hangs down his hands weakly, it trembles a bit before it can't no longer move.
	Dan still wants to shoot, but bunny shouts in panic, "Mommy!”
	“Bring him to the basement, lock him up with them.” Dan calls his underling, the day suddenly gets cold, and the monstrous anger brewing in his black eyes seems like it could destroy everything.
	The underling immediately understands it, he drags Jack's back collar and goes away.
	Jamie has never been shot before, it feels very painful in the hit area, as if it's burning, the pain makes her faint.
	"Silent!" Dan threw away the gun in his hand, he quickly walks over to support Jamie's fallen body. Her little face is extremely pale, and she’s frowning.
	——
	They push Jamie into the surgery room.
	The surgery room's light turns on, while Dan and bunny stands restless in front of it.
	“It's all my fault, if I didn't run over, mommy wouldn't get hurt for saving Me.” bunny lowers his head with depressed face.
	He’s just worried about his daddy and mommy, and his appearance back then had unexpectedly given Jack the chance.
	Even if Dan's angry, he doesn't blame bunny, Dan rubs his head to console him, "Jack is the only one to blame, for he's too sly. Your mommy can't bear to see you getting hurt, just like how you can't bear to see her get in trouble.”
	Just like at that time when bunny was kidnapped and those men's sneak attack in the dark, Dan would rather getting hurt himself, than seeing bunny getting hurt.
	Bunny is still blaming himself, he squeezes his small fist. He knows which basement his daddy has sent Jack to, he won't let them go so easily!
Chapter 404: The Adult and Child Are Saved
	People who dare to hurt his mommy, must pay the price!
	Not long after, a doctor who's wearing sterile suit suddenly opens the surgery room door and walks over, “Who's the family?”
	“We are.” Dan and bunny quickly comes to the doctor.
	“The patient is already 2 weeks pregnant, but now she has lost a lot of blood, both the child and the adult is in danger, you must choose one of them to save.”
	One the doctor completes his sentence, Dan and bunny looks distracted, they're looking at the doctor in shock.
	2 weeks? Dan frowns and counts carefully.
	Isn't that the time when Jamie came back to take the myth ring, for so many times…
	He should be happy when hearing this news, but the doctor unexpectedly says that he should choose one of them to save. He thinks that anything is not as important when compared with Jamie.
	They could make another child.
	Bunny looks at Dan's handsome and shocked face, the guilt in his heart grows bigger. He'll be so sad if they lose mommy or his future little sister because of him.
	“Daddy……” bunny is very reluctant, the doctor says that they can only save one, but he's greedy and wants to save both his mommy and the child inside mommy's belly!
	"If you've decided, please sign on this paper or consent, the patient can't wait for long.” the doctor takes the paper of consent from the nurse and hands it over to Dan.
	Dan looks at the doctor maliciously, making the doctor tremble all over and stops urging him.
	He takes the paper of consent, his gaze is complicated with pain, if Jamie knows she's having another child, she'll be very happy.
	She once said that it'll be perfect if she has another daughter, with bunny as the big brother who’s composed and smart, and will also love his little sister very much, his little sister can just be a princess without doing anything.
	5 years ago when they hadn't separated, she often imagined that they'd have a daughter like her, and a son like him.
	But now when her hopes are already fulfilled, destiny forcibly stops it.
	How sad would she be if she knew that she had a child, but she had no choice but to abandon her.
	I'm sorry my child, daddy loves you too.
	Dan shuts his eyes with force, before opening it again, he grabs that gel ink pen, he exerts so much strength it almost break the pen.
	Dan puts so much pressure on every line of his name below his signature, he's extremely reluctant. The tip of the pen almost penetrate through the paper, after writing the last line, he then returns the gel ink pen and paper of consent to the doctor.
	Bunny bites his mouth looking at the signature, it's a first for him to feel such a strong grievance and pain, and it’s as strong as when he found that his mommy is missing.
	The doctor's sharp eyes looks at the pen that now has a few crack marks, it amazes him.
	The doctor takes the paper of consent in Dan's hand and hands it over to the nurse.
	The doctor that originally wants to console this father and son, immediately turns around and goes into the surgery room to prepare for the surgery.
	Bunny looks at the doctor who's entering the surgery room with red puffy eyes, nothing is more important than mommy's life, but if mommy knew about this matter after she's awake, how sad would she be.
	“Wait.” Dan and bunny turn their heads to see where that loud and clear sound with rushing footsteps comes from.
	They see Ryan walking over while pulling a nurse that's going to enter the surgery room, “Don't start the surgery.”
	“Uncle Ryan……” bunny opens his small mouth, and calls Ryan uncle out of his habit.
	“Let me do it, I can save both the adult and child.” Ryan says that while he looks at Dan.
	Actually, he came over to see Jamie again, he already decided that he doesn't want to get involved with their problem and Jack’s, but seeing that she got hit by a bullet and entered the surgery room, and hearing that the doctor can’t save Jamie's child, he can't keep his calm.
	Dan knows his identity, he nods without a single doubt.
	“Hey, what are you doing? Irrelevant people may not enter.” says the doctor furiously from inside.
	“Let him do it, he can.” Dan says that to the doctor inside while pushing the half-opened door.
	“But ……”
	“But what? If you're not willing to stay here, get out. I can save her and her child by myself anyway!” Ryan glares at those doctors discontentedly, if they don't take the bullet out now, Jamie will die, she's originally weak from pregnant, letting her suffer like this, do they really want her to die?
	Dan's sudden roar astonished those doctors, they turn their heads to look at Dan's firm gaze, and they just follow what he wants.
	They don't worry about anything with Dan's assurance.
	They shut surgery room's door once again, Dan and bunny's tense expression becomes quite relaxed.
	They're not sure if other people can do it, but Night. 9 can.
	Dan and bunny knows clearly that Night. 9, Ryan, can save both Jamie and the child.
	Don’t know for how long, it takes so much time that Dan and bunny who keeps maintaining their standing posture feels numb. When they move for a bit, it feels unbearably painful.
	After 3 hours, the surgery room's light is finally off, the door opens up, a few doctors wearing white gowns walks out with shock, like they haven't snap out of something shocking.
	“His medical skill is really thorough, we all have no way to save both the adult and the child, he unexpectedly did it.”
	“No way, the odds are clearly low, when he's the one handling it, it's a miracle.”
	Some doctor shakes their head and sighs.
	“Doctor, how's my wife?” Dan and bunny asks hurriedly after walking over to the doctors with numb legs.
	“There's nothing serious left, both the adult and the child are okay, she only needs to rest for a few days before getting out of the hospital.” says the head doctor before sighing and leaving them.
	The nurses pushes Jamie out of the surgery room, even if her face is very pale, but her life is no longer in danger.
	“Mommy.” bunny calls her softly, and then sniffs, his eyes are still puffy red, he's very sad. He follows Dan and the nurse from behind.
	Ryan rubs his eyebrows behind them, his body faintly smells fishy, he slightly frowns, he really wants to take a bath and change his clothes before coming back.
	But, he doesn't have much time.
	He's afraid the longer he stays, the more reluctant he'll be to go.
	Love for over 20 years, he can't give it up so easily.
	Late at night, inside the VIP ward, Jamie slowly regains his consciousness. She looks up at the white ceiling, smelling disinfectant air says, she slightly frowns.
	Where am I?
	Jamie wants to move, but she finds out that even by moving a bit, her shoulder hurts as hell. In a split second, her memories flit by.
Chapter 405: I Wish It Is A Little Sister
	She remembers that she has been hit by a bullet, but luckily it has only hit her shoulder.
	Jamie is always optimistic and very good at taking chances. She already feels lucky that the bullet hasn't hit her heart, but her shoulder.
	Luckily, Bunny is fine.
	When she looks down, she sees Bunny lying on the head of the bed.
	Jamie slowly reaches out her fingers. She tries not to tear her wounds and gently pokes Bunny's soft cheek.
	As soon as she pokes him a few times, Bunny wakes up. He looks up and sees his mom's gentle and loving eyes. Then he raises his eyebrows and says happily, "Mommy!"
	"Don't shout. I'm not deaf." Jamie knows she's in the wrong for waking him up, but she's always been good at being cheeky, so she blames Bunny instead.
	Bunny doesn't argue with her. He wants to give her a big hug, but he's worried he'll touch her wounds, so he holds back.
	"Where's your daddy?" Jamie looks around. She licks her dry lips and her mouth is also dry with little moisture.
	Bunny sees her move and knows she wants a drink of water. He pours a glass of water from the side of the kettle and takes a straw so Jamie can bite on the straw and drink without having to sit up.
	After finishing a glass of water Jamie still feels thirsty, so she lets Bunny pour two more glasses. It is only after she drinks that she feels better all over.
	"Daddy's gone home to get a change of clothes. You woke up just after he left." Bunny puts down the glass of water and blinks at Jamie. A touch of guilt emerges from his big eyes.
	"Why are you looking at Mommy like that? It's not just a day or two since Mommy was so beautiful. If your daddy sees you staring at me, he's going to be jealous again." Jamie looks at Bunny and feels he’s a little strange, so she teases.
	It is rare that Bunny doesn't roll his eyes at her, but hugs her uninjured arm and says, "Mommy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have gotten hurt."
	"Don't be ridiculous. Mummy doesn't blame you. Besides, what mother in the world would watch her child die without saving him?" Jamie says and reaches up to poke his little face, "If you're feeling guilty, get your mommy some cherries. I don't know what's going on lately, but I like sour foods more and more."
	And she keeps feeling sick to her stomach.
	It can't be that she's been living an irregular lifestyle lately, and then all this has caused something to happen to her body, can it?
	Jamie shivers just thinking about it. She isn't going to add a new injury to her old one, is she? She feels bad!
	Maybe if she has been too busy dealing with Jack and fighting with him, so she is overly nervous. Jamie just thinks it is because she is stressed and not paying much attention to her period. Plus, she'd been more likely to eat sour foods than sweet since she was a child, so she was even less worried about it.
	Bunny's little face changes instantly. He looks at Jamie with a touch of disgust, "Mummy, you've got a little sister in your tummy. You have been a mother at least, can you stop being so careless?"
	If she'd found out sooner, how would they feel comfortable letting her confound Jack? They'd have taken a rope and just tied her up at home.
	"How did you know it was a little sister?" Jamie follows Bunny's words and asks.
	After a second, two seconds, three seconds....
	Bunny resolutely covers his ears. Then in the next second, Jamie's growl rings out, "What did you just say?! What, what little sister?!"
	Bunny waits until she's done growling before letting go of her little hand. He looks at her calmly, "The little sister in Mommy's tummy is two weeks old."
	She's, she's got, a little, little sister inside her?
	Jamie's watery eyes widens in horror. She can't care less about the injury on her shoulder and touches her belly with her hand under the blanket.
	The surprise comes so suddenly, she can't digest it for a while...
	After the shock, Jamie feels a touch of elation rise from the tip of her heart.
	It warms her heart so much.
	"Aren't you happy, Mommy?" Bunny looks at Jamie's changing face and asks.
	Can she say she's not happy when she is already pregnant?
	She's simply not ready to have another child, she has a lot of unfinished plans, and she wants to travel around the world, and she wants to design more clothes and make a name for herself in the fashion industry...
	But why is the joy in her heart almost overshadowing her frustration? Why?
	"Baby, Mommy's got you already. You've had a hard time growing up, and now you have a little sister, isn't that trouble plus trouble?" Jamie pretends to say it sincerely. She watches Bunny as she fools him.
	Bunny gets frustrated. Mom actually calls him trouble!
	How can she call him a trouble!
	He was only three years old when she trained him to go grocery shopping by himself, and then she forced him to learn how to cook. He starts out with nothing and becomes more and more proficient. By the time he is a little older, even Bunny herself is amazed at how he has learned in the first place.
	He works hard every day to cook her delicious food and does the housework carefully every day. But now Mummy actually dislikes him for being a trouble and has also disliked his future little sister.
	He feels aggrieved.
	"It's okay Mummy. You give birth to my little sister and I'll bring her up for you." Bunny says as he pats his chest and holds his chin high.
	Jamie looks at him with amusement. She really wants to say, "Baby, if you can give birth for your mommy, then mommy won't have any trouble keeping her for as long as you want."
	"Do you know how to bring up children?"
	"No." Bunny is still confident-faced, "But I can learn."
	Bunny is looking forward to having a cute little sister.
	"Haha, you're still just a little kid, and you want to bring up another kid younger than you are. Do you think you're a baby daddy?" Jamie wants so badly to poke his face a few times, but she can't reach out.
	But when she thinks about it, she feels it makes sense.
	Back then, she has forced Bunny to become a household handyman. If she starts making him learn how to raise the kids from now on, won't that save her the trouble later?
	The more she thinks about it, the more it makes sense. Jamie is already planning it in her mind.
	Bunny, on the other hand, doesn't know that his mommy already has plans in her mind on how to raise him to be a good new century baby daddy. He thinks his mommy won't let him raise his little sister and is determined to convince her.
	Bunny is already getting farther and farther down the road to being trapped in Mommy's pit, but he also volunteers to jump into it and even hold a few handfuls of dirt before burying himself in it.
	"Mummy, just don't worry about leaving my little sister to me, I'm going to bring her up fate and white!"
	Bunny promises and blinks at Jamie.
	Jamie is embarrassed. Are you sure you're not talking about pigs?
	"How do you know it is a little sister? May it is a little brother?" Jamie raises her eyebrows and looks at him curiously.
	The baby is only two-week old, and it’s still no bigger than a small bean sprout. Is it any wonder Bunny can foresee the future?
	He takes a look at Jamie's belly awkwardly before saying, "I hope it's a little sister. It must be."
Chapter 406: Jamie, I Owe You A Lot
	"So she's whatever you want her to be, huh? Maybe it's a little brother. Baby, it's not good to prefer girls to boys." Jamie feels cheerful. Hearing Bunny's words, it sounds like she's going to have a girl this time.
	She also really wants a daughter. She has told Dan since a long time ago that in the future, when they got married, she would definitely have two children, one son like him and one daughter like her.
	Bunny looks like Dan, so it will be perfect to have another daughter who looks like her.
	But Jamie also knows that such things can't be thought of, and that it's more important to just let nature take its course. If she expects too much now, she'll be disappointed if it doesn't work out the way she wants later.
	So it is good that she stays calm.
	"I like little sisters. Boys are so naughty and not at all cute." Bunny wrinkles his little nose and snorts. He has completely forgotten that he is just a boy.
	Bunny actually doesn't like girls, because those girls in kindergarten are nymphomaniacs and always cry, which is very annoying.
	But if Mommy gives birth to a girl, Bunny thinks she will be especially cute, and she will not be like those little kids who always cry.
	After all, he is an example himself.
	"You'd better not expect too much. Mummy can't make the decisions."
	"Why?" Bunny opens her eyes wide in puzzlement, as if to ask, "Why can't you decide whether your child is a boy or a girl?
	Jamie does not know whether to laugh or cry. If she can feel the gender of her child, she'll be the God.
	"How about if you say 'little sister, little sister comes out' to it every day? Maybe it'll turn into a girl." It's rare for Jamie to see Bunny look so childish. She wants to play a joke on him, so she says wryly.
	Bunny's first reaction is that it's unlikely, but he's tempted again by Jamie's words.
	"Will this really make it a little sister?" Bunny looks confused. If it's really possible, it's okay to let him read for as many days as she wants.
	Jamie holds back her smile and nods with conviction, "It'll be okay."
	Bunny gets relieved at once. He looks at what is probably Jamie's abdomen. Even though the blanket covers it, it still can't keep Bunny's blazing gaze away.
	Is this the legendary ... staring at someone and then it will turn into a girl?
	At this moment, the hospital room door opened. Ryan waits for them to finish talking before coming in from outside.
	Jamie is a little surprised when she sees him. Bunny whispers in her ear and tell her the story before it dawns on her.
	"Ian, I have something to tell your mommy alone." Ryan says as he looks at Bunny, and his tone is as gentle as ever.
	Bunny isn't surprised. After all, he's been waiting outside for so long. He looks over at Jamie and sees that she doesn't object, so he leaves the room and closes the door.
	Ryan walks over to a stool and sits down. Jamie is struggling to sit up with her other arm. Seeing this, Ryan immediately goes to help her.
	"Thank you this time. If it wasn't for you, I'm afraid the baby and I wouldn't be here right now." Jamie purses her pale lips before saying.
	She looks at Ryan with mixed feelings. She has once thought he was the man of her life. He came out of nowhere and saved her and Bunny. She considers him her most important friend, family member, trusted him and talks to him about everything.
	Ryan is gentle and thoughtful. As long as it is about her, he will do his best for her.
	She used to think that he was the best person in the world for her, except for Dan.
	She used to think that she has spent half her life being lucky to have met such a good friend.
	But after everything gets exposed, she realizes that everything isn't as simple as she thinks it will be.
	It is only when she is struggling in the sea and is rescued by him that she suddenly realizes and dares to think about the things she has been unwilling to think about.
	Yes, she has been aware of it, but she just doesn't want to face it, so she chooses to run away from it. Ever since the time she has been kidnapped by Hooson, she has had a vague sense that something is wrong.
	But she doesn’t dare to think about it. How can a good friend who has accompanied her through the toughest years of her life be someone who has every intention of using her?
	Until she was kidnapped out at sea, and when Ryan showed up, Jamie's heart was filled with sadness. But she chose to deliberately ignore it, until she struggled once when he asked her if she believed him. She told herself in her heart to trust him one last time.
	It was that last time that she finally saw clearly that it was all within his calculations.
	What she finds even more unacceptable is the fact that Ryan has approached her from the beginning, and every time he has helped her, even the few times he has risked his life to save her, he has done so with a purpose.
	She is someone who treasures her friends. Once a friend, always a friend. That's why she finds it is so hard to accept when she finds out that she has been used and deceived by him all along.
	"I owe you that." A wry smirk lifted a corner of his lips, "Jamie, I owe you a lot."
	Jamie doesn't say anything, and she just looks at him quietly.
	"The truth is, I didn't mean to use you, and I didn't approach you to get what I wanted." Ryan clasps his hands together. For the first time, he feels nervous.
	"Do you remember when you were a kid, a little boy who gave you a white rabbit milk candy?" He looks up at her with a touch of expectation and then laughs at himself, "How could you remember something so long ago!"
	A white rabbit milk candy?
	Jamie frowns. She doesn't like candy. Her favorite childhood sweet food is chestnut cake, and it is rare for her to eat candies because she only likes sour candies and has no interest in sweet food.
	As soon as Ryan says it, she remembers.
	She has a particularly good memory since she was a child, not that she purposely wants to remember, but there are some things she doesn't forget easily.
	She remembers a time when she is chasing after a dog she has raised in the garden. The dog is a birthday present from her mother, and she likes those cute snow-white animals.
	She slept in Dan's bed and ran back quickly after waking up because she was afraid of getting her butt spanked by him. She was small, so she could have easily come through that hole in the garden, and there was nothing Dan could do about it.
	Jamie has a love of beauty when she was little, but she didn't care much about her image. She was so good at climbing trees and scraping in the mud that even Dan couldn't do anything about it. Dan was a clean frank, but he had to put up with being touched by the dirty girl every time.
	It was that time. Jamie's mother loved to arrange flowers when she has nothing else to do, so Jamie was playing with her dog in the yard. She chased after the dog, and she fell over as her short arms and legs made her unsteady.
Chapter 407: Peek At You Secretly
	If it is any other day, Jamie will have make a fuss after getting up, but last time she had knocked her knees on a rock, and it was very painful. Jamie is afraid of pain very much, it is like killing her. So her mouth starts to tremble as she is about to cry.
	Since Ryan has secretly peeked at Jamie and Adele, he tries to find some chances to visit this kid too. In order to prevent Jack from discovering him, Adele has been hiding pretty well.
	But unexpectedly Jack still sees them in the end, maybe because Ryan is still too young, Jack doesn’t take him away or force him to do anything. Instead, he secretly looks for Ryan’s only relative, which is Anna.
	Ryan realizes that after he has been stealing glances at Jamie, he starts to have some interest in this kid. He would find every chance to visit her. The other day, he is able to complete the medicine ahead of time, so to reward himself, he decides to pay Jamie a visit again.
	When he has just entered the courtyard, he sees that Jamie has stumbled to the ground, and it is not a minor injury. She is twitching her lips, preparing to cry.
	Ryan scans his surroundings to make sure there are no other people present, only then he carefully tiptoes towards Jamie and for the first time appears in front of her.
	He doesn’t know how to console a girl, because he has not been taught about this in the organization. Besides, the only girl in the organization would never cry even if she’s badly injured. So, Ryan is at a loss right now.
	In a hurry, he produces a rabbit shaped toffee candy and gives it to her. He says gently, “Don’t cry, take this sweet.”
	Jamie is able to stop herself from crying because of his voice. She is curious about this good-looking boy in front of her, as she stares at him with watery eyes.
	Jamie who has been pestering Dan non-stop is still a naïve girl who is obsessed with handsome boys, so he can’t resist anyone who appears in front of her. She receives the candy while staring at Ryan and then proceeds to peel the wrapping and send the candy into her mouth.
	After chewing for some time, Jamie only realizes that this candy is the type that she dislikes, but for the sake of the handsome boy in front of her, she is able accept this candy no matter how it tastes.
	“Hi handsome boy, are you from the heavens?” Jamie flips around and sits on the ground without caring about dirtying her dress which was prepared by Adele. There are chumps of soil on her face, which makes her look like a cat.
	Her pair of bright eyes are like crystals, they are translucent, which seems to overshadow and dazzle Ryan.
	Perhaps he has been lingering in the darkness for too long, so he’s at a loss when he sees something so pure and bright.
	“No, I came here by walking.” Ryan shakes his head in denial. He was born with a friendly face, and his smile resembles the sun, which radiates warmth to his surroundings, and put people around him at ease.
	“Then where did you come from?” Jamie probes further while continuing chewing the candy before swallowing the toffee candy. Her mouth is now filled with a faint sweetness, which causes her to twitch her nose.
	Ryan doesn’t know how to reply her, as he can’t reveal to her that he’s actually staying in the same house as her. If someone who has ill intentions gets ahold of this fact, it will be bad for everyone.
	While thinking of this, Ryan suddenly regrets his ridiculous actions. He’s already scared out of his wits since being discovered by Jack. If he’s discovered by someone else now, he’ll be doomed.
	So, he stands up and prepares to leave. But his shirt is being tugged by someone.
	When he turns around, he sees Jamie’s gloomy face staring at him, which makes him jump a little. She says, “Are you a bad guy? Are you going to kidnap my ‘woof woof’?”
	Who is she talking about?
	Ryan looks into the distance and sees a white ball of fur rolling around on the ground and immediately understands what she means. Still, compared to that ‘woof woof’, the daughter of the Gilbert family would worth much more, right?
	Ryan feels helpless now, and he finds himself not able to tell any lies in front of this sly little girl.
	“Do I look like a bad guy?” Ryan lowers his head, a mature light shining in his eyes which makes him look mature beyond his years, coupled with his baby face, he looks mild and gentle.
	Jamie stares at him for some time, and then suddenly shows a smile, “Dan said that you can’t discover a bad guy by looking at his face!”
	“…” Ryan twitches his mouth as he feels the urge to tap on her head.
	Dan…
	She is probably talking about the boy who lives next door. It seems like they are close.
	When Ryan comes across this thought, he feels a little gloomy. He has been by Adele’s side all along, but for some reason he never witnessed Jamie who was born at that time. He was only able to look at Jamie’s face secretly when she was four years old.
	In a state of confusion, Ryan is prepared to leave, but he hears Jamie’s soothing voice drifting into his ears again, “I believe that you are a good guy, a good guy always gives me food.”
	Jamie is indeed a glutton, even though the candy that Ryan had given her is not something she enjoys, but she still regards this handsome boy as a good guy.
	Ryan stops in his tracks and freezes slightly. Her words are like stones which causes a ripple in his heart.
	Although her trust is based on food, but this is the first time that Ryan feels trusted, and it feels really good.
	“Oh, Dan is back!” Jamie suddenly shrieks as sound of a car parking next door can be heard. She waves at Ryan before slipping into the William family house on bare feet.
	Ryan then sees that Jamie is already sticking herself on Dan. She doesn’t care about the dirt all over her. She just continues hugging him.
	Ryan thinks that a serious child such as Dan will be upset at her actions.
	To his surprise, he sees a loving and tender expression on his serious-looking face.
	Jamie’s reminiscence comes to an end, and it ends at the scene where the handsome boy has given her a toffee candy. On the other hand, Ryan is able to remember every details clearly, including Jamie’s sad face when she is about to cry.
	“You…” Jamie looks at him in astonishment, realizing that he’s that boy from back then. She was very young, it never occurred to her to ask him about his presence in the Moore family.
	This is probably because he’s the Night. 9.
	“Then you have been watching me when I grow up? Since I was born? Jamie asks him since Ryan was always at the Moore family protecting her mother. Then he should be able to watch over her as she grew up.
	Ryan shakes his head in disagreement, “Because of my special identity, I was not able to leave the room prepared by the lady. But I always overheard the maids discussing about you, mainly praising you for your cuteness. This piqued my interest and I decided to take a look at you.”
	While describing this, Ryan smiles faintly. He is puzzled himself as to why he would be interested in a four-year-old little girl and thinking that the sight of her sucking her fingers were so adorable.
Chapter 408: You Guys Are Not Alone
	When he sees her interaction with Dan, he feels surprisingly bitter.
	He is probably envious of Dan who is able to be loved by her and hug her at such close proximity. On the other hand, he can only hide himself and steal glances at her secretly
	The Gilbert family has passed down a saying that prevents them from becoming another person’s weakness, including their closest relatives.
	There is a reason Jack can use his unknown younger sister to threaten him.
	This is because all he ever wanted is freedom, the right to stand under the sunlight, the right to be seen by her. It doesn’t matter if he can only be one of her friends.
	Ryan has always known that he’s not as harmless as seen in the eyes of Jamie.
	He’s selfish, cold-blooded, and in order to reach his goals he will use any means necessary.
	“You were adorable when you were young.” After remaining silent for some time, Ryan comments on her while looking at Jamie without hiding his tenderness.
	Jamie is stunned by his stare, she twitches her mouth but no words are coming.
	“Your mother’s last mission for me is to protect you at all cost. But in the end, I have betrayed her trust, and let you experience harm again and again.”
	“When you were in England, it was my doing by targeting bunny and you, especially that close call on the road, that’s also because of me sending someone to do that.”
	“After returning to the country, I have turned into Hooson. I can see the sense of familiarity in your eyes. Actually, I am quite happy that you’ve discovered my true identity. Indeed, there are similarities between Hooson and me, but about me bumping into you, I have done that purposely.”
	Jamie is so shell shocked that she can’t say anything at the moment as images flood her mind. So it turns out that everything has been planned beforehand.
	“Do you still remember when you fell from the hanging wire and it was me who had saved you?” Ryan’s voice is very soft like a feather lightly brushes through the air, but for Jamie it is as heavy as the lead.
	Jamie could never forget that time. She has been feeling sorry for him and not knowing how to repay his kindness. She owes him her life now because he was willing to put himself in danger when saving her.
	She never doubts that it is all a well-planned conspiracy, an unbelievable fraud.
	“That was all my doing, to put on a show in front of you. It was all to gain your trust, so that there would be no room for distrust…”
	Slap—
	He is still in the middle of his sentence, but suddenly his face cocks to one side, his hair is slightly messy now, and a red imprint is slowly forming on his pale cheeks.
	Jamie is biting her lips hard, as if this can lessen her sadness and suffering. Her hand that has just slapped Ryan is hanging in midair, before slowly falling down. Her eyes are full of anger and disappointment.
	“You have done so much, and you even used your life to gain my trust, do you think this is funny?” Her tone is no longer gentle, and it is tinged with ice and fury.
	Ryan is not surprised at her hitting him. He calmly turns his head towards her, and maintains his smile while looking at her, “Being angry is not good for your pregnancy.”
	“If you don’t want to see me angry, you can get lost now.” Jamie glares at him coldly while handing down the ultimatum.
	“You must have never guessed what I have done to you all along using the identities of Ryan and Hooson. Every move by me is purposeful. You would never have guessed that this was all planned meticulously. I always ask myself, why things would come to this, when I am the one who doesn’t want to hurt you the most; when I am the one who wants to protect you the most.”
	“But every time, I have some part to play in your pain and sufferings.”
	He smiles like usual, as smooth as the jade, but there is a hint of sadness mixed within the smile.
	“How could I hurt you? Things shouldn’t come to this. You are the last person I would have hurt in this world.” When he comes to this, he can’t help but cover his face with his palms, his shoulders slightly shuddering now.
	Then, Jamie sees a stream of tears flowing down his cheeks, and they end up on the clean and tiny bed sheet.
	It would be lie to say that she’s not stunned. In Jamie’s memory, she has never seen him crying, as if he is always the gentle and calm person he used to be.
	This is the first time that she has seen him losing control like this.
	Her pink lips are pressed into a line, then Jamie slowly replies him, “There is no way to reverse the suffering, what’s done is done. Even if you regret your actions, even if you feel sorry for me.”
	“The pain and scars inflicted on my body will never cease to exist.”
	Ryan trembles violently, as if he’s being given a wake-up call.
	“I used to think that you are my best friend in the world. It’s been my pleasure to know you, not only because you have helped me, but more importantly I can feel your sincerity towards me.”
	“I never imagine that this friendship is also a conspiracy by you, this friendship was never real.” Jamie’s eyes darken, and a cold breeze is sweeping through her empty heart.
	She looks up and sees Ryan who is petrified by her and says with clarity, “Ryan, nobody ever forces you to do all of these, as well as hurting me, it was all you’re doing, yours alone.”
	“Jack will never send someone to hurt me even if he wants to get the Myth ring from me. He would gain nothing if something has happened to me.” Jamie continues.
	“Even if he wants to do something to me, he can just cancel my credit card, and leave me powerless in a foreign country. As for you, I don’t think Jack knows that you have done all of these either.”
	When she saw the documents from Dan, she naturally doubt the credibility of it. But now that she has given it a careful thought, and connects the sea jump incident and what happened in B country, suddenly everything seems possible to her.
	Ryan’s flabbergasted face slowly returns to his normal expression as he listens quietly to her while clenching his fists.
	“And what are you aiming for by doing all of these? You are not by any means controlled by Jack, but you are willing to act as his pawn, watching him hurt me, my loved ones and my family.”
	As she continues, Jamie’s eyes are full of melancholy, and her gaze slowly transforms into a stranger’s eyes, “Ryan, admit it. You have become a twisted man. You are no longer that kind big brother who would always try to make me laugh and stop me from crying. You heart is even more wicked than Jack’s.”
	“That big brother in my memory always carries himself with maturity, with eyes so pure and clear. Now, your eyes are beyond muddy.”
	Both of them should be the same person, and each personality could be identified easily, but Jamie would never have thought that they are the same person.
	One is in the light, while the other has sunken into darkness. It is hard to believe they are both the same person.
	Ryan is no longer the Night. 9, the Night. 9 that she knows has become part of her irretrievable memories.
Chapter 409: He Shouldn’t Come
	Ryan jerks his head up instantly after hearing Jamie’s accusations. Her words are like the bright sunlight which envelops him fully, leaving him with nowhere to hide.
	After that, he grabs his hair, and manages a muffled laugh. His laughter has no substance, as if it is a breeze that passes through deserted land.
	She is right, he is no longer the Night. 9. Ever since he had let Jack knew about his formidable medical skills, he has become a selfish, twisted person, who has abandoned his past.
	At first, he just wants to exist in Jamie’s world freely and unrestricted.
	But as time goes by, he begins to feel jealousy and unwillingness to succumb to Dan who has been friends with Jamie two years prior to him. It is this simple fact that caused him to forever lose his chance to be with her.
	He used to think that he would finally have his chance in England, but back then Jamie couldn’t forget Dan. Oftentimes, she would stare at Ian without averting her gaze, as if she could see through Ian and peek at someone beyond him. Ryan didn’t fail to recognize that she’s missing Dan.
	Maybe she never knows that her love for Dan has caused her to lose herself momentarily. She has been by Dan’s side throughout her childhood too.
	He always thought that he would have his chance in England, but in the end, she decided to go back.
	Back to Dan’s side.
	He’s not staying with them in England because he didn’t want to witness something undesirable with his own eyes. He couldn’t resign himself to it, he was angry and envious, why was Dan the only one who could have her love, even after five long years?
	Dan has continuously hurt her, but her love never wavers. On the other hand, he has tried his best to be by her side, but they can only remain friends.
	Ryan has been feeling wronged for too long, it is precisely these feelings of unwillingness and jealousy that has led to his destruction. These feelings have caused him to lose himself in doing all those ridiculous things.
	He is determined to make sure that others can’t have what he couldn’t get his hands on.
	His tendency has led to him forgetting that he should at all times protect Jamie, as his lifelong mission. But every time he lay eyes on her, he can’t control his inner demons and he would impulsively hurt her.
	He really did all those awful things.
	His love has turned into something hideous.
	He is no longer able to control himself, to prevent himself from hurting her in the end. By hurting her, he could have some solace.
	He used to think that he will get used to loving her for a long time, but it turns out he has gotten used to hurting her and this is an irreversible habit.
	Jamie’s words that he is no longer that kind big brother to her has hit him hard. The boy in her memories is pure and gentle while the man in front of her now is dark and twisted.
	“I can’t deny that you are really that kind of person, but in my memory, the big brother and Ryan are now two completely different persons.” Jamie quietly stares at him until he lets go of his messy hair and lifts his head to look at her.
	“I’m really sorry for hurting you, I only realized now that all those years, I’m the one who has inflicted the most pain on you.” It is this realization that makes it hard for him to acknowledge that he had actually done all those things.
	“I thought that I would never hurt you in the name of protecting you, but the truth is I have been hurting you all along.”
	“Stop it, let bygones be bygones. It doesn’t matter if you apologize to him a million times, there’s no way I will forget about this. Perhaps it is a wrong decision for you to come here.” Jamie says lightly, her cold gaze no longer caring about Ryan who is now in a daze.
	He really shouldn’t be here. If he has never come here, she would still think that this is just a coincidence, and they can continue being friends. After all, he has saved her and the child in her belly.
	But now that he has revealed everything, there is no going back now. They can’t even be friends anymore.
	Ryan is silent for a while, then he stands up, and looks at her with a deep gaze. He slowly heads towards the door, but he stops short and turns around, “Are we still friends in the future?”
	He is extra careful while asking this. Within his warm eyes there is a splatter of red beneath. His eyes are looking at her as if he is grasping the last straw of hope.
	Jamie is moved only ever so slightly, but she is able to steel her heart in the end. She responds to him by tilting her face away from him.
	Ryan just shows a faint and hollow smile. She was right, he shouldn’t be here, and he shouldn’t tell her all of these.
	He can’t comprehend the reason he starts to spill everything when his gaze fell upon her weak and pale face.
	The door finally shuts, and when Jamie turns her head towards the door once again, there is no one there.
	She places a pillow behind her, and focuses her gaze on the night sky outside the window while leaning against the pillow. There is loneliness in her eyes.
	Everything will probably end here.
	The room is warm enough, and the windows are all shut tightly. Despite that, Jamie somehow feels waves of cold air gently caressing her skin, and her fingertips inadvertently become chilly.
	After unmoving for some time, she only look at the clock and know that it is already four thirty at dawn. She decides to slip into her blankets to get some sleep.
	But at this moment, with a loud bang, the door is flung open.
	Jamie is terrified, what the hell is happening? It was Ryan just now, and who is visiting her now? She would never be able to get some sleep this way.
	It seems like people like to visit patients in the afterhours of the night.
	“Jamie, my dear Jamie, you must have suffered a lot!” A figure slips in like a shadow and appears at her side instantly. He immediately hugs her hard, “Oh my god, my darling, I didn’t even get a chance to change my clothes before rushing here. Are you fine? Are you hurt anywhere?”
	As he says this, he continues hugging Jamie.
	Oh my god!
	Jamie’s face changes drastically as it grows pale even more. In Chris’ hug, she can’t even produce a word in reply.
	She... she is going to be suffocated!
	Ian also walks in at this time, and seeing that Chris is hugging his mother so hard, he immediately goes to kick him, “Uncle! You are suffocating mum!”
	Only then does Chris let go of Jamie as she tries to catch her breath. He looks at her with a sorry look and says, “I’m sorry Jamie, I’m too agitated…”
	Jamie just rolls her eyes at him while patting her chest. This is the first time that she is able to appreciate oxygen.
	Chris sees her rolling her eyes and he smiles sheepishly before turning his face towards bunny. His eyes fall upon bunny’s ugly expression.
	“Bunny, aren’t you happy being with uncle? Why is your face like that.” Chris lightly pokes Ian’s tiny face and feels the bounciness of his skin.
	Ian just snorts in reply and slaps away his hands. At the thought of this stupid uncle accidentally hurting his future younger sister, Ian is so angry that he is gritting his teeth!
	“Mummy is pregnant with my younger sister, uncle, you have to put some distance between you and mummy.” Seeing that Chris is going to take a seat, Ian immediately shifts the position of the chair and places a stool in between him and Jamie.
	Chris is provoked by his actions, but his protests are stuck in his throat.
	“What, what did you say just now? Jamie, Jamie is…” Chris points at Jamie’s belly and says in shock.
Chapter 410: Marriage without wedding
	When Jamie sees his reaction, she suddenly feels calm, when she got to know the news before, she was also shocked.
	“Jamie, you already have two kids, but I am still single!” Chris sits down, and looks at Jamie’s little baby, then he looks at Jamie’s baby bump, and says with surprise.
	Jamie rolls her eyes, and says to him, “But isn’t there July? I know that she has a thing for you, and during the time you disappeared, she came to me almost everyday!”
	Chris expression skims over, then he clears his throat, his eyes moving away.
	There is something behind, Jamie and Bunny exchange looks, and she squints her eyes.
	“Oh, by the by, what happened when you disappeared? Was it something with Dad?” Jamie asks, she thinks that he will protect her, but who knew that she just met him again today.
	“Elan was under god knows who’s influence, and they crushed the succession ceremony. They were lucky I was there, we all thought it is going to be a nightmare, but then their influence just stopped, and Grandpa’s power protected Dad, so he finally in the end inherited the whole Lockwood family.” Chris quickly summarizes the whole story to tell Jamie.
	The reason he is able to be back by today is only that the situation in the Lockwood family has been settled, and Elan won’t be able to do more damage.
	Jamie calms down when she hears that Dad is alright, and nods her head.
	But wait, who is the force that influenced them to work together with Elan?
	Jamie remembers something, and suddenly stops nodding her head.
	She remembers that time when she went to the Lockwood family with Dan, she saw Ryan in the backyard.
	Back then, she thought that she must have seen a ghost, but now...
	Jamie made a little noise, she is a little afraid of the scheme that Ryan has set up, if he wants her life, then she would have died already.
	But the only thing that ever happened to her was for her to get hurt, Ryan might not really want her dead then.
	He has planned it all so detailed, is it really just to watch her fall on her head again and again?
	Jamie cannot understand, and she decides to stop thinking about it, she turns to Chris and says, “Don’t forget to look for July, she was really worried about you, and I really do think that the two of you would make a nice couple.”
	Chris looks a little uncomfortable, then he says as if something just came to his mind, “Oh, by the way, Jamie, do I remember it right that you and Dan have not arranged a wedding yet? You just got certified?”
	“Yeah.” Jamie can feel that Chris is trying to change the topic, she nods, and allows him to continue.
	“You already have two kids, does he not plan a wedding with you? Before, there were misunderstandings, but now it is all cleared, won’t you regret it if there is no wedding in your marriage?” Chris says as if he really means it, his expression so genuine.
	Chris’ words get Jamie into thinking, he seems to have a point, and she never thought about this before, since she has already given birth to a child for Dan, she doesn’t really care about the wedding as much anymore.
	But Chris seems to have a good point...
	Chris is looking at her, blinking his eyes rapidly, as if he is trying to tell her, see, I am right!
	“I actually think the ceremony is not important.” Jamie raises her voice intentionally, and shrugs her shoulders, teasing her brother.
	Chris immediately gets anxious, worrying about the ceremony more than Jamie herself, “How can it not be important? You only have it once in your whole life, how can this not matter to you?”
	Jamie blinks her eyes a few times, and looks at Chris innocently, “He has not mentioned it yet.”
	Chris is stunned, and tells her in all seriousness, “If he is not getting married to you, I am going to take you to France tomorrow!”
	Chris’ tone of speaking is very serious, he does not seem to be joking at all.
	“An outside might think now that you are the one to get married to him.” Jamie shakes her head, “If I had the time, I would rather eat a bit more.”
	Jamie holds her forehead, and watches Chris take his hands back, and sit back in his seat, his eyes accusing her.
	Chris reaches out his hand again to snip on Jamie’s forehead, and then he notices what he just did. He clenches his fists, and clears his throat. He looks like he wants to say something, but his cell starts to ring in that moment.
	Chris takes out his cell to check for the number, his face shows impatience, but his eyes show soft tenderness.
	“What’s up? Who is calling you? Is it my future sister in law?” Jamie sees the tender expression that quickly fades from Chris’ eyes, and smiles.
	“Who knows?” Chris raises his brows, but does not pick up the call, he waves the phone in front of her eyes to tease her, to raise her curiosity.
	Jamie humphs, sooner or later she will know who it is, so she will keep her patience.
	Then she says, “She is your wife, not mine, I don’t need to know anyways.”
	Chris laughs and replies, “Where is your heart. I’ll get going, maybe I will come tomorrow again.”
	“Sure, remember to be more loving and warm to my future sister in law!” Jamie waves to him, and when she sees him exit her ward, she purses her lips, her eyes are showing some disappointment.
	She is mumbling two words, wedding ceremony?
	Jamie rolls herself in the blanket, and feels somehow empty.
	Which girl doesn’t want a romantic wedding ceremony? She is no exception, but Dan has not mentioned it yet, and she doesn’t dare to start talking about it either.
	Jamie closes her eyes a little embarrassed, her head filled with thoughts, does he want her to kneel down in front of him and propose?
	That will be a big shock.
	She only needs to think of that scene, and she won’t need to eat for the rest of her life anymore.
	“Get out, get out...” Jamie says out loud to try and get the thoughts out of her head.
	Dan puts down a few bags full of groceries on the couch in the ward, he just walked to Jamie’s side, when he hears her say those words.
	“What are you mumbling?” Dan reaches out his hand and snips on Jamie’s forehead, it wasn’t hard, but it was exactly the place where Chris has snipped on her forehead before, so now, it is hurting her.
	“Oh man, are you trying to kill me?” Jamie opens her eyes immediately, and shoots him a look, the spot on her forehead is getting red.
	Dan sees it too, and feels a little distressed about it, he sits down next to Jamie, and rubs her forehead gently with his big hand.
	“Why are you so late?” Jamie is not an unreasonable girl, she wraps her arm around Dan’s waist, and buries her face in his side, then she yawns.
	“Yeah, something came up.” Dan doesn’t explain more, but his eyes are showing something malicious.
	He raises his hand, and keeps rubbing Jamie’s forehead gently, it is so comforting, that Jamie wants to sleep.
	She opens her mouth for another yawn, she was so full of spirit a minute ago, how come she wants to sleep again.
Chapter 411: Son or daughter?
	“Dan, do you like to have a son or a daughter?” Jamie’s face is still buries into his waist, her eyes are feeling tired, her lids are heavy, but she fights the tiredness, and wants to hear his answer first before falling asleep.
	“It doesn’t matter, as long as you are their mother.” His voice is as calm as usual, he doesn’t think much about his answer, but it is very genuine.
	No matter if it’s a boy or a girl, as long as Jamie is the mother.
	Dan leans his chin on Jamie’s head, and sighs softly, happy that both Jamie and the child are there, otherwise, his life would look completely different now.
	In his head, a plan is taking form.
	......
	Ever since Jamie’ pregnancy, the whole William’s family is treating her like a treasure, always afraid something might happen to her, they watch every single step she took.
	Which leads to Jamie gaining a couple of pounds in only one month pregnancy.
	Jamie looks at her picture in the mirror, her usually small face is not chubby, which makes her want to cry.
	She is standing in front of a big mirror, her hands holding her waist, it has not been a whole month yet, so it is not too visible, but she still thinks that she has gained a lot of weight. Her clothes used to fit perfectly before, and now, they don’t even fit anymore.
	Girls care a lot about their body figure, if Jamie used to have the courage to just eat what she wants, it was because she knew she won’t gain weight easily, but now, she doesn’t dare to anymore.
	Who knows how many extra nutrition and vitamins Dan’s mother has added in her meals to make her gain so much in just two weeks.
	She really wants to lose some of it...
	When Dan comes out of the bathroom, he sees Jamie stand in front of the mirror, watching herself from up to down, complaining to herself.
	But Dan is already used to it.
	He doesn’t even understand what it is that she is looking for in the mirror.
	“Dan.” Jamie sees Dan coming out of the bathroom and looks at him searching for pity.
	“What is it?” Dan puts down the towel in his hand and walks to her, hugging her from behind.
	The smell of Dan’s shampoo is surrounding Jamie, and her small face blushes immediately, she clears her throat lightly, and complains to him, “I got fat.”
	Fat?
	Dan raises his brows, and reaches out to grab her hands, then he pinches her waist, yeah, she is a little chubbier than before, and he can feel it when he is hugging her as well.
	“But that’s not bad either.” She feels softer in his arms, why would he not like it?
	And where is she even fat? She is just a little chubbier than before, and before it didn’t matter how much she ate, and with all the vitamins he arranged for her, he never managed to get her to gain weight.
	These days Jamie is drinking the soup his mother makes for her everyday, her facial color looks much better since then, her little face is rounder, and her body is rounder as well, her curves coming out more than before. Dan only needs to look at her, and his eyes darken already.
	“You are not a woman, of course you like it, if you have the balls, why don’t you give birth to the baby.” Jamie rolls her eyes on Dan, and keeps looking at her picture in the mirror, not feeling good.
	“......” Dan tries to show how innocent he is, since Jamie’s pregnancy, her temper has raised a lot as well.
	Before, she would get in his way once in a while, but she would never ignore him, or even revolt against him.
	But now...
	He accidentally gets Jamie angry, and she would kick him with his blanket out of the bedroom.
	Dan also wants to revive back to his classes, so...
	“Just do some more sport, then you will get back into shape.” Dan says voice is lowered, his jaw laying on Jamie’s shoulder.
	“What kind of sport should I do? Your mom is watching every step I take, she won’t even let me go jogging...” Even if she just wants to go downstairs, her mother in law will watch her every move.
	She even seems like she would want to take the stairs for her daughter in law, if she can only.
	Jamie is touched, but also feels bad at the same time, she is touched by the way her mother in law takes care of her, but at the same time she feels sad thinking about the time back in England, when she was raising Bunny all alone.
	Jamie sighs deeply, in her eyes are showing pity.
	“What’s wrong?” Dan presses his cheeks on hers, and watching the two of them in the mirror, his lips form into a soft smile.
	Dan is very tall, his body is strong like a tree, and the way he holds Jamie’s tiny body from behind, wrapping her into his arms, as if the two of them are made for each other.
	“Sadly my baby has not had such a fortunate childhood like this baby in you.” Jamie is leaning all of her weight into Dan’s hug, her eyes showing a complicated look.
	Maybe it’s just the environment, leading Bunny to mature so early, he is not like other children, he didn’t have that childhood, and he was always a very smart boy-
	He has been through so much that he wasn’t supposed to.
	But the baby in her tummy, is already enjoying the best treatment it can get, before it is even born, enjoying the excitement of the family waiting for it’s birth.
	The baby isn’t even a month old, but it’s grandmother and grandfather already buy a lot of toys, even Amelia, who never liked her, prepares a lot of things for the baby.
	When Jamie was pregnant with Bunny, except for her and her brother, barely anyone knew about the child.
	Jamie feels bad about it, she feels guilty, so she tries not to talk about the baby during meals or at any other occasion.
	She doesn’t want to hurt Bunny’s feelings, making him think they might ignore him just because of this baby.
	“Bunny is only 5 years old, but he is already more mature than any other kid his age, he won’t bother for all of that, and plus, doesn’t he love this baby too?” Dan lowers his head, his big hand covering Jamie’s belly, rubbing it lovingly.
	Jamie nods her head, she knows that Bunny won’t mind, but she still worries subconsciously, no matter how mature he is, he is still a child.
	Jamie saw in the news a few days ago, that a little girl forced her mother to get an abortion, afraid that she won’t be loved anymore after the birth of the child.
	All Jamie can do is to shake her head on that, thankfully, Bunny would never do that.
	“Mommy!” Just as they are talking about him, Bunny comes running from outside, like a fireball, he stops in front of them, and raises his chin to look up.
	“What are you running from, a ghost?” Jamie reaches out her hand to touch his little face, his soft little face that she loved so much.
	Bunny takes a deep breath, breathes out, in again, and out again, then he starts talking to Jamie’s tummy, “Little sister, little sister, come on out already!”
Chapter 412: Don’t let Mommy down
	He only stops after saying it for five times, then he says to Jamie, “Mommy, I almost forgot to talk to my baby sister today, I will go now, bye Mom, bye Dad!”
	When he finishes, he leaves just as fast as he entered.
	Jamie blinks her eyes, then she finally feels her son is a normal.
	Dan’s lips cramp for a little, then he looks at Jamie with a joyful expression, “How long has he been doing that?”
	Jamie counts for a while, then her eyes brighten up, “It’s been two weeks almost.”
	She wonders why he believes what she told him before, she was actually joking about it, even if he talks to her tummy every day, it might not be a little girl.
	“Imagine it’s a boy, he will be so disappointed.” Jamie leans on the door and looks into the direction that Bunny ran to, she rubs her chin while thinking.
	If it is a boy, and Bunny won’t even talk to him, what then?
	Dan takes a good look at her tummy, and smiles at her, “It’s a girl, 90%!”
	“How would you know?” Jamie doesn’t believe him.
	“You don’t believe me?”
	Jamie humphs, who will believe someone to tell her the sex of her baby with just one look, as if he had x-ray eyes.
	“Why don’t we bet on it?” Dan isn’t bothered that she doesn’t believe him, he puts on a face that he understands, acting that the baby can’t be anything else than a girl.
	“What do we bet on?”
	“I say that baby is definitely a girl, if I am right, you’ll have to do something for me, same goes for the other way around.”
	Jamie’s eyes light up after hearing that, it is not easy to get Dan to agree to her conditions, so she won’t let this chance go!
	“Sure, why not, let’s just wait for it, I know I will win!” Jamie raises her chin confidently, she almost laughs out loud.
	Doesn’t Dan know anything about a sixth sense? She can already feel that it is a boy, he is going to lose if he wants to take this bet with her.
	And on top of that, last night, she had a dream about a little baby boy running towards her, looking just like Bunny, and calling her Mommy.
	Even though she also wants to have a baby girl, but just to win this bet, baby, don’t let Mommy down.
	Jamie decides, that from today on, she is going to tell her tummy, “Baby boy, baby boy, come out soon!”
	“Jamie, will you marry me?” Dan looks at her little victorious face, and already knows what she is thinking about, but he doesn’t expose her, and asks her that question.
	“Of course, of course, aren’t we already married anyways?” Jamie says subconsciously, but when she finishes, she covers her face, she’s not shy at all, that can’t be!
	Dan chuckles, he tilts his head slightly, and presses his cool lips on Jamie’s neck, kissing her softly.
	The sudden coolness of his lips make her body shiver, her face blushes, and the beauty is so seductive, she bites her lips and reaches out to push him away, “Don’t...”
	Dan doesn’t react to her pushing, the movement of his lips getting softer, and he moves along of her beautiful long neck, his teeth biting her skin lightly, inviting her, but also trying to hold himself.
	Jamie cannot stand the invitation, and her body softens in his hug, she is turned around by his arms, and presses her back against the mirror, she raises her head, and his lips land on hers.
	The soft kiss, charming and intricate, tossing and turning on her tender lips, using the moment of her breath to invade inside her mouth, discovering the inside.
	The temperature in the room seem to rise, and only the heart beat of them is still beating fast.
	Jamie’s clothes are already ripped off half, and she was about to be conquered by Dan, when Jamie finds a moment of clarity, and remembers the baby in her tummy, she holds Dan’s hand to stop him, but she accidentally holds his...
	Her face is so hot, she draws her hand back as if she was electrocuted, and she says to him while he is looking at her lovingly, “The first and last trimester we can’t.”
	Dan seems also to know about that, and his eyes are looking at her upset, but he reaches out his hands to pull her clothes up and fixing them, then he plants a kiss on her sexy lips, turns around and goes to the bathroom.
	It doesn’t happen often that Dan is so flattened, and Jamie is joyful about that, but just as she turns around, she is shocked by her picture in the mirror.
	This pink face, with her watery eyes, a shy look and her rosy lips, she looks like a delectable dehydrated cherry.
	Oh my, if she hasn’t stopped him on time, it would have been the end.
	Jamie pats herself on the chest, her heart still beating hard.
	About 20 minutes later, Dan finally comes out of the bathroom, when he is out, he has changed his clothes, and looks at Jamie, who smiles at him with a big grin.
	Three months.
	Is she mocking him now?
	Dan raises his brows and walks to his closet, then he picks out some comfortable clothes for Jamie to change into, before he takes her somewhere.
	“Where are we going?” Jamie takes the blue leather jacket in her hand, and asks him curiously.
	But Dan does not answer her question, he only starts to change his own clothes in front of her.
	Jamie blushes again, and curses him, but she still takes a good look at his naked back, before she vanishes into the bathroom.
	After she gets changed, she does not ask more questions, and follows Dan downstairs.
	Usually at this time, Dan’s mother and the nanny are talking about the menu, while Dan’s father is enjoying a cup of tea in the backyard, the maids see that Jamie is coming down, and all watch her carefully, afraid that she might fall or something else, every step she takes is being watched.
	It has been two weeks now, Jamie is getting used to it, she takes Dan’s arm, and walks with him outside.
	She takes a look into the kitchen though, and sees that Dan’s mother is not coming out to check on her, which she is relieved about.
	She looks like a little girl who is sneaking out and doesn’t want her parents to know.
	Jamie thinks that Dan is taking her out of the garden, or out to take a walk.
	But after a while she notices, that they are still in the garden.
	Where are they going?
	Jamie’s thoughts are full of doubts, when the two of them stop walking right in front of a tunnel entrance.
	Their property is so big, Jamie has walked it before, but she doesn’t really know the place well, and now that they are suddenly standing in front of a tunnel, she feels very surprised.
	“Take my arm, and do not let go, check the ground you walk on.” Dan tells her, the lights in the tunnel aren’t very bright, and it’s kind of covered, so she really has to be very careful, to prevent herself from slipping.
Chapter 413: They know each other
	It is wide inside, but slightly cold, and Jamie is happy that Dan asked her to wear another layer, so she doesn’t feel the cold now, she feels a bit knocked out by the wind that keeps blowing inside, but Dan, who is holding her hand, makes her feel secure.
	Jamie is wearing her mask, which has a light smell of mint on it, and it keeps the humid smell in the tunnel away, so she doesn’t feel sick.
	They walk for about five minutes, and Jamie feels with every minute that they reach the end, when Dan takes her hand and leads her down the stairs.
	At the end of the stairs is a hall, on which both sides are different rooms, that are enclosed by metal gates. Walking on the hallway they can easily see what is inside the rooms.
	“She...” Jamie looks around, and her eyes suddenly stop, her feet are taking her towards a room on the left side, until she stands in front of the gate.
	Inside lies a woman, who is very skinny, the kind of skinny that happens from lack of nutrition. She seems to only have bones and skin left, her arms are hanging on her sides, the hair cover half of her face, so Jamie can’t see what she looks like.
	But the shirt that she is wearing, Jamie has seen it before.
	Jamie is a excellent fashion designer, she is very sensitive when it comes to clothes, and she doesn’t forget the ones she has seen before.
	Even though these clothes are very dirty, but she can still see what they look like.
	“Jozo?” Jamie calls out after a while.
	The woman on the floor suddenly moves when she hears Jamie’s voice, she sits up slowly, and then suddenly runs towards her without Jamie expecting it at all.
	Jamie’s eyes widen, and before she can react to the sudden movements, Dan has already taken her into his hug, her eyes meet the ones of the woman that are full of hate. Her heart skips a beat.
	Dan knits his eyebrows, he looks at Jozo with his cold eyes, that are sharp as a blade.
	Jozo starts to shiver under Dan’s stare, but she keeps looking at Jamie.
	“I want to get out, let me out, I am going to sue you!” Jozo’s voice is breaking, she bangs her hands against the metal gate, if it isn’t there, she will throw herself on Jamie.
	She looks very odd, no matter how much a person loses weight, it shouldn’t be this much.
	Wait...
	Jamie’s gaze move away from Jozo’s grimaced face, and looks at her legs that were unable to move before, “I thought her legs were...”
	Jozo’s legs don’t look like they are paralyzed at all, and the way she crawled towards her just before, doesn’t look like someone who is disabled.
	Jamie suddenly remembers the day she went to look for Jozo.
	When she entered the house, she saw her covered legs were bend under the blanket, even though it was only for a few seconds, but Jamie thought that she might have misunderstood, but who knew...
	“She is not paralyzed, it was just a trap.” Dan says with his cold voice, explaining to Jamie calmly.
	“A trap? Dan, even if I was lying, I still saved your life before, you can’t treat me like this!” Jozo can’t take this capture anymore, she tries to get the gate loose, but except for the metal sound, nothing else happens.
	She has enough of this, she thinks if she takes the poison, she will be able to drag it out for a while after she falls into a deep sleep. Even if Dan tries to find Jamie, as long as she doesn’t wake up, he won’t be able to ask her anything.
	Even though she knows it had something to do with her, she will still use the fact that she has saved him before to place demands on him.
	But when she notices that Jack is also brought in, she knows that not only is Jamie still alive, but Jack is captured.
	Jozo is still holding on to her last hope, and looks at Dan pitifully, hoping that since she saved him once, he will let her live.
	“That one time you saved me was because of your plan with Jack, wanting me to feel guilty about your paralyzed legs?” Dan’s eyes are looking at her calmly.
	Jozo’s face turns pale, she bites her lips and doesn’t reply to Dan anymore, as if Dan knows something he shouldn’t.
	“Do you really think I don’t know?” Dan’s lips form into a smile, if Jozo is really paralyzed because of saving him, he will not only take care of her, but also pay her a decent amount of compensation.
	“Finding the best doctors to take care of you, was the best I could do, if you didn’t have any use to me, do you really think you had the ability to rip me off?”
	“Was it Alma?” Jozo’s hands are wrapped around the metal sticks on the gate, her heart filled with hate.
	It can only be her, there is no one else, only Alma would stay by her side all day.
	Dan doesn’t want to talk to her anymore, he is only holding Jamie’s waist, and keeps walking.
	“Wait, Dan, Jamie, you can’t go, you can’t leave me here, it was Jack that told me to do all these things, if you want to get back at someone, it should be him!” Jozo sees that they are about to leave, and starts yelling, but suddenly she bends over and hold her stomach, her forehead is full of sweat.
	Pumping out her stomach didn’t wash off all of the poison that she took, she thinks Dan will help her to get it all out since she saved him once, but who knows that he asks the doctors to keep half of it in. It won’t kill her, but it brings her horrible pain everyday, it feels like thousands of needles poking her.
	Otherwise she wouldn’t have gotten so skinny either, if it keeps going on, she will die.
	“When did you know that she isn’t paralyzed? And, what happened to her?” Jamie asks Dan curiously, looking at his handsome profile, even though it helps to release her anger seeing Jozo like this, but she still feels bad inside.
	“Do you think those doctors I hired are stupid? When I knew that Jozo’s reports were fake, I asked people to get into it.” Dan reaches out his hand to help Jamie pull up her mask, he tidies up her face mask, and then answers her slowly, “It’s her own fault that she looks the way she does now, I will send her away tomorrow though.”
	“But what is the relation between her and Jack? They have never been seen together before.” Jamie feels a little muffled because of the face mask, but Dan can still hear what she is saying.
	“They don’t need to meet to know each other, and the one who directed Jozo to do all this is Ryan, Jack doesn’t have the brains to think of all that.”
	Jamie suddenly understands much more, and nods her head. No wonder that she has seen Jozo and Ryan together before, she thought she didn’t see right, and then she didn’t bother about it anymore.
	So, they have been in contact long ago.
	“Jozo has rescued you before, don’t you feel bad to lock her up like this?” Jamie asks Dan while she wraps her arms around him.
	Dan looks at her from the side, he feels weird listening to her say this, then he replies to her in a good mood, “If there was someone you have never seen in your life pushing you away from a car, what is your first thought?”
	“Like a free meal? Why would he save me without even knowing me?” Jamie replies immediately.
	“Not too dumb.” Dan shakes his head, as if there was still hope for Jamie.
	But at that time all Dan was thinking about was to find Jamie, and even afterwards, it was his medical team that took care of Jozo, so he didn’t bother more.
	Jamie purses her lips, they walk towards the end of the tunnel, then both of them stop.
Chapter 414: There’s Something Fishy
	“And who’s in there?” Jamie swallows and held Dan’s arms tight.
	Dan steps to the wall and pushes one of the grids in it, then the light fills the room in front of them, and there’s a man in it.
	He’s Jack Moore. He looks intact yet weak and terrible. Dan William haven’t done anything to him, yet he does prepare a super “bonus”.
	“Well, Dan, where’s Celina and Mia? It’s weird they don’t show up.” Jamie said in whisper, pursing her lips.
	Particularly, Jamie nearly forgets Mia without Jack’s presence.
	After she disappeared, nobody has ever seen her. Maybe Jack also doesn’t know her traces, or he wouldn’t ask her for Mia after the glass was lost.
	“Celina has hidden away with the rest money of your father’s company since it was in decline. So has Mia,” Dan spoke quietly as if his investigation doesn’t contribute much.
	It’s never enough for him to take a revenge on Jamie’s family members who have hurt Jamie and himself.
	Jamie sighed in relief as her mother would be so happy to see those bastards being punished.
	A collapsed family and a broken company are Jack’s payment.
	Jack Moore seems to hear something and opens his eyes. Instantly, he bolted over to Jamie as he sees her, and he looks at her imploringly. “Jamie, my sweetheart, are you here to save daddy?”
	Screw you!
	Jamie puzzles her pretty brows as the word “daddy” hurts her a lot. “Who’s your daughter? Jack Moore, What the heck are you thinking?”
	“I am your father as I’ve been raised you for eighteen years. How can you treat me like this?” Jack shamelessly justifies himself.
	Jamie huffs through a quiet laugh as her lips curl into a sneer. Eyes cold, she stares at Jack. “Are you doing the math with me?”
	Before Jack can part his lips, Jamie continues to say, “Since I was a little girl when I took you as my dear father, you rarely showed up. Once I had so high a fever that my mom called you for help, but you only told her to let me drink more water.”
	“It was a high fever, and you just let me drink more water?”
	Jack is shocked at Jamie’s accusations, and Jamie knows him too well as he only wants the Myth ring.
	Dan’s heart is stung by Jamie’s words, and he grips her hand tightly. Looking at Jamie’s calm face, Dan quietly sighs.
	Every time Dan saw Jamie lie in her mother’s hug and listen to stories, he felt sorry for Jamie.
	Due to his parents’ neglect, he was used to be alone in his childhood, lonely and isolated.
	At the beginning, he felt tired and sick of Jamie’s company, but she always got various methods for soothing his anger away.
	When he finally got used to her sleeping with him, one day, she didn’t show up. Then he went to find her sleeping in her own room due to over-exhaustion.
	So, with the approval of Jamie’s mother, he pinched at Jamie’s collar, and dragged her to his room.
	Since then, he realized he was addicted to Jamie.
	Without her around, Dan’s world will be void as if there’s a hole in his heart.
	Jamie’s voice is calm. “If my mom had told me you were not my father, never would I disguise myself as a boy to Moore family.”
	“Do you know what my greatest luck is? That is you’re Mia’s father instead of mine.
	Jack stops his beg as Jamie gets his scheme, and she’ll never makes peace with him.
	After the couple gets out of the basement, suddenly, Jamie asks Dan, “How to deal with him?”
	Dan gently runs his hand through Jamie’s hair and says, “It’s up to you.”
	Jamie thinks it over and says, “Let’s send him to the police station. He’s so guilty that he will spend his rest life behind the bars.”
	It’s better that he stays alone in the jail than bothers them in their own basement.
	“Okay. I’ll make my men work on it,” Dan answers with smile. Then his phone rings, and he looks at the number. “I have to answer it.”
	Dan walks away to pick up the phone.
	Jamie stares at his silhouette confusingly and wonders why he doesn’t do it in front of her.
	There must be something fishy going on.
	Jamie shrugs her shoulders and looks at Dan dubiously, finding he is strange today.
	He always tells her whose call it is, but today he acts like he gets a secret call.
	It’s so weird.
Chapter 415: Who’s Your Bro？
	How strange it is!
	Including this one, Jamie has been suspicious about Dan’s weird behaviors for 29 times. Maybe she is kind of paranoid, but Dan’s behaviors are too strange.
	It’s said that pregnant women are oversensitive and easily get emotional.
	Jamie has pregnant for nearly two months, during which Dan puts aside his business issues and often accompanies her. Dan doesn’t get his video calls from business meetings unless she’s sleeping.
	However, …
	Ever since last time they came back from the basement, Dan has numerous phone calls to answer, and each of them is not short.
	Every time she wakes up, she can’t see him around.
	Jamie doesn’t think she’s making a fuss as Dan is really suspicious.
	Wendy tells her that men are thirsty for sex when their wives are pregnant. Dan probably is having an affair with some girl out there.
	Jamie instantly shakes her heads to get rid of those thoughts. She trusts her husband that he won’t betray her.
	However, why is her heart beating so fast?
	Jamie sullenly rubs her hair and sits up on her bed. It’s already evening as she wakes up from her dreams, while Dan’s still not at home.
	It’s the sixth time he has come home late this month.
	Jamie finds the remote control and switches on all the lights in the room, which are so dazzling that she uncomfortably squinted around the whole room.
	Looking at the big empty room, she wants to cry out her sorrow loneliness.
	Jamie pats her own face, sobs a little, gets off her bed and steps into the bathroom to get herself clean.
	When does she become so emotional? Does she want to spend her rest life in tears?
	She is about to go downstairs after cleaning her face when she notices her phone screen is wakened. She walks over to her phone and finds it’s Wendy’s call.
	“Jamie, I’m right about men. No men can be loyal to their relationship. Crap! They’re all dickheads,” Wendy huffs as if she’s about to beat someone.
	Jamie has a bad feeling and asks with a gentle frown, “What’s wrong?”
	“Ask your dear husband. I find him walking into a hotel with a beauty, and they look quite intimate. Holy shoot! Don’t stop me. I’m going to slap their faces hard, or they don’t know the price of betrayal.”
	It sounds noisy over there, while Wendy is yelling at someone else in the middle of their conversation, and Jamie also hears Eddie’s voices.
	Jamie is startled and doesn’t know what to say.
	“Who are you talking about? Whom do you meet?”
	“Dan William. Who else can we talk about? I told you men would always betray women. Guess what? I’m right again. Eddie, why do you stop me? Let’s go to punch the dickhead in his face, bro.” Wendy doesn’t finish her words as she starts to argue with Eddie again.
	“Who’s your damned bro? I’m your boyfriend!” Eddie is exasperated.
	“Anyway, we’re at the Star Hotel now. See you outside.” Wendy quickly hangs up the phone.
	“Do you think it’s okay for her to get here now?” Eddie asks and looks at Wendy’s glaring at him with hands covering her lips, which pleases Eddie a lot.
	“Why not?” Wendy glares at Eddie who just bit her lips.
	“Don’t you remember? She’s pregnant. What if she gets hurt outside? Dan will kill you,” Eddie says impatiently and pokes Wendy’s forehead with his index finger.
	Wendy forgets to contradicts his words, while she pats her head as if she’s suddenly enlightened. “Crap! How can I forget it? I’m calling her to stop her coming here.”
	Wendy’s too furious to care for Jamie’s pregnancy. Jamie’s life will be threatened if she is irritated by the disgusting scene. It’s the last thing Wendy wants to see.
	“Holy crap! Her phone is powered off…” Wendy looks at Eddie frustratingly.
	Jamie casually grabs an overcoat and puts it on. After wearing her scarf, she hastily gets out her room and scurries downstairs.
	Dan’s mother is worried about Jamie’s baby and said, “Calm down, Jamie, just take your time.”
	“Mom, I have to go out, and I won’t have dinner at home.” Jamie walks up to Dan’s mother with a serious look.
	“No. You’re not alone, and what about your baby? You have to have dinner now for your baby’s sake.” Dan’s mother instantly disagrees with her. She feels guilty of Jamie’s last pregnancy when Jamie had Bunny, for she didn’t take good care of Jamie, and Jamie suffered much. Now Dan’s mother wants to make up for her mistake.
	Plus, Dan’s mother really cares for the baby as she wants to spend her rest life with grandchildren around.
	“But…”
	Jamie is too kind to spoil Dan’s mother’s goodness, and she has no choice but to sit down and have dinner with Dan’s mother.
	In the end of the dinner, Dan’s mother feels relieved as she sees Jamie have a bowl of tonic herbal soup.
	“Mom, I have to leave now.” Jamie puts down her bowl, gratitude radiating off of her eyes, for she knows Dan’s mother really loves her and the baby.
	“Wait! It’s seven o’clock. What are you doing outside? It’s not safe as you’re pregnant. Tell me your issue and I’ll do it.” Dan’s mother holds her hands and lovingly looks at her.
	Jamie is touched as Dan’s mother eases her worries about Wendy’s words. “Mom, it’s okay. the driver will escort me there.”
	“But…” Dan’s mother still wants to say something.
	“Just let her go. Jamie is not a child, and she can deal with it,” Dan’s father says to Dan’s mother.
	Jamie smiled. “Thank you! I have to leave now.”
	She makes up a light-hearted smile and leaves the villa. Before the door is closed, she still hears Dan’s mother’s voices. “Jamie is always a child in my mind.”
	The words are so familiar as Jamie’s mother used to tell her the same.
	--
	The driver sends Jamie to the Star Hotel, and Jamie says, “I’ll go back home later. You may leave now.”
	“Mrs. Jamie, the madam orders me to send you back home safely, so…” The driver is in a pickle as he has no ideas whether he should disobey Jamie or not. Clearly, everyone in William family is in favor of Jamie, and he should obey her orders, too.
	“Well, I’ll come out soon.” Jamie doesn’t want to put him into a dilemma. Then she gets off the car and walks into the hotel, finding Wendy is waiting for her.
	“Jamie!” Wendy is about to shed tears when she sees Jamie. She still blames herself for telling Jamie to come here as she should have beaten the dickhead without informing Jamie.
	Jamie also quickly walks up to Wendy.
Chapter 416: Why Are You Blushing？
	“Where’s Dan?” Jamie’s face is like a stone as she doesn’t care about Wendy ‘s pleasing expression or her sorry gaze. All she cares about is to find her husband.
	She wants to see with her own eyes as she believes Dan will never betray her.
	But she feels kind of scared. Her chest heaves up and down as if something is clogging her throat, making her suffocative.
	“This hotel excels at protecting their guests’ privacy, so I can’t locate them, but Eddie has followed them to the room. I’ll ask him. Calm down as it may not be what we think,” Wendy comforts her and calls Eddie for Dan’s location.
	Coincidentally, Eddie calls her first.
	“So, do you get it? Where are they now?” Wendy hastily asks.
	Eddie pauses for a moment of silence and says awkwardly, “Well, you’d better not come here…”
	“What?” Wendy angrily cuts in, “Are they making…Just tell me where are they, and we’ll get there soon.”
	“At the open-air lobby on the first floor.”
	Open-air lobby? Why are they there?
	What’s on Wendy’s mind is to rush there, so she doesn’t think it over as she drags Jamie to the hotel. Wendy is a member of the hotel, and they enter there with Wendy’s member card.
	There aren’t any obstacles on their way.
	Jamie keeps silent all the way with a speck of worry in her eyes. Her grip on Wendy’s hand is tighter and tighter, while her pace is lowering with hesitation.
	“Bring it on, Jamie. If he dares betray you, I’ll beat him to death.” Wendy turns to look at Jamie with a serious face.
	“Can you win him?” Jamie doubts dryly, glimpsing at Wendy.
	Wendy pauses for a second as she knows she can’t win the fight. She can’t even hold out her hands in his face. However, she’ll punish him at all costs.
	“I have Eddie to help me. I don’t think Dan can beat us together.”
	Jamie shakes her head and feels speechless.
	The Star Hotel is so large that it takes eight minutes to get to the lobby.
	Eddie suddenly stops them before they can enter the lobby.
	“What the heck are you doing? Step aside.” Wendy glares at Eddie as she thinks he is weird. He’s reluctant to tell them Dan’s location, and he even stops them to question Dan in his face.
	“I think it’s a big mistake.” Eddie thinks he should explain the mistake or talk them into returning home the better, because what he sees is different with whatever Wendy thinks.
	“Mistake or not. We can see it through on our own. Now step away.” Suddenly Wendy is irritated as she finds Eddies tries to cover up for Dan.
	Eddie blinks to Wendy, gesturing she should take Jamie away.
	But his blinks don’t work as Wendy is confused.
	“You…” Wendy blinks as Eddie does, “Are your eyes trembling?”
	“…”
	Jamie gets Eddie’s gesture, so she walks toward the lobby before Wendy takes her away.
	“Wait!” Eddie holds out his hands and grabs Jamie, “You can’t enter the lobby.”
	“Why?” Jamie frowns and glares at him.
	Eddie curses Dan in his mind without any expression on his face. “You…”
	He just parts his lips, while Wendy suddenly lunges at him jumping on his body and wraps him up in her arms and legs like an octopus, exclaiming, “Jamie, go to find Dan. I’ll be here waiting.”
	“Thanks, Wendy.” Jamie sighs in relief as Wendy successfully stops Eddie by locking him tight.
	Eddie awkwardly looks at Wendy holding him tight in her arms and legs. Waiters around also inexplicitly look at them.
	“Wendy, let go of me now.”
	“Release you to tip off Dan William? Never! Ever!” Wendy even wrap him tighter and presses her cheeks against Eddie’s warm shirt, whose fragrance of soap pleases her, making her presses harder.
	However, no matter how hard she tries, she always falls down from his body, and she’ll climb on his body again. All the up-and-down rubs just get Eddie aroused.
	“Don’t move, or I’ll fuck you now.” Eddie holds upward Wendy’s hips so that she won’t fall down from him again. His voice sounds husky and seductive.
	Wendy gets coy and bits him on his shoulder, angry with his threaten.
	“Ouch!” Eddie’s face is a bit crumpled as Wendy bites him so hard that he almost loosens his hands.
	“Why don’t you let us enter the lobby?” Wendy glares at him.
	Wendy used to be reserved and shy in public, but now she forgets her lady-like image, hanging on Eddie’s body, which is quite erotic.
	Eddie sighs and gently whispers the truth in her ear.
	Eddie’s warm breath tickles Wendy’s cheeks, and an electric thrill runs through her body, making her blushes scarlet.
	“Why are you blushing?” Eddie flirtatiously looks at her, amusement dancing behind his eyes.
	They have hugged each other in public for many times, but today she blushes.
	How adorable!
	“Who’s blushing? Yuck! You son of a bitch.” Wendy is coy and irritated.
	“Fine. You’re not blushing. Since we have things figured out, let’s go back home and make you really blush.” Eddie doesn’t drop her but cuddles her walking out of the hotel, paying no attention to others’ staring.
	“Don’t you ever talk about my fu… blushing.” Wendy almost spills out that word again, but she holds it back. She’s not allowed to say any dirty words since she became Eddie’s girlfriend.
	Eddie snorts with his smug face.
	“Good grief. Wait! Why are you still holding me in your arms? People are watching us. Just put me down now.” Wendy finds she’s still in Eddie’s arms, so she bashfully buries her head into his hug.
	They walk away flirting with each other as people look at them.
	“Damn it! We’re the ones out of the four that are still single.” Bruce and Duke come here for business. When they’re about to leave, they notice Eddie and Wendy.
	Duke’s face is stone-cold while he’s staring at the silhouettes of Eddie and Wendy, clenching his fists tight.
Chapter 417: What Juicy Gossip
	“Crap,” Bruce sighs.
	He did have a crush on Anna Pork, but he has cut her out since he saw her through.
	“Well, Dan has married Jamie, so I think Eddie and Wendy will get married soon.”
	Bruce says to himself, while he neither notices Duke’s gloomy face, nor senses the chill aloofness radiating off of him in waves.
	“There’s no surprise that they should be together. After all, they have been best friends since high school. Why can’t I notice Eddie loves Wendy? I used to think they’re just bros, ” Bruce says, his hands rubbing his chin.
	“Well, it makes sense. They are a man and a woman, and what else affection can we expect of them? It has to be sexual love…Holy shoot! What the heck are you doing?” Bruce is interrupted as he is startled by Duke, who punches the wall so hard that there’s a hole in it.
	Bruce hastily pats his chest with a shocked face. “It’s okay to damage the wall, but what if your hand is maimed? Are you insane?”
	Duke snorts dryly and countered, “There does exist other affection except sexual love. Do you think they are meant to be together?”
	Bruce is kind of shocked by Duke’s abnormal response.
	Hold on.
	Does he?
	“Duke, do you love Wendy?” Bruce asks unbelievably as it sounds like Duke is jealousy.
	Bruce doesn’t answer his question, which is a silent “Yes”.
	“Don’t you have a crush on Joey Lan? How can you love Wendy?” Bruce is shocked trembling.
	What juicy gossip!
	No wonder Duke has never showed up with Joey together since Joey made a scene on the engagement party, not to mention Bruce rarely saw Duke around during that time.
	It turned out that Duke went to Wendy’s home to find her during that time. He used to think Duke went there for the sake of their parents’ friendship, but now Bruce gets it that Duke is crushed on Wendy.
	“How can you hide the secret from me, bro? It’s not cool.” Bruce hits his shoulder and says, “but Wendy and Eddie are so happy as you can see, and they’re about to get married. It’s not that I don’t get your back, but you’d better quit now.”
	Honestly, although Duke is his best friend, Bruce still thinks Wendy and Eddie match the most.
	Duke is too stone-cold for outgoing girls like Wendy.
	“As long as they’re not married, I still have a chance,” Bruce says with his eyes glowing with confidence.
	Bruce looks at Duke and frowns as if Duke is a stranger. “Well, it’s immoral to steal others’ girlfriend, bro. Plus, for Joey Lan, you have got Wendy thrown into the jail. I’m afraid she hasn’t forgiven you yet.”
	Wendy is like a sister to Bruce, and he believes Wendy won’t hit Joey purposely, instead, he thinks it’s an accident.
	However, Duke put Wendy into the jail which made her suffered a lot.
	Fact is, Wendy had no motive to hit Joey. To grab Duke away from Joey? Impossible. Wendy would rather give it away rather than grab it from others, if it doesn’t belong to her.
	Bruce believes that Wendy is innocent in the accident.
	“I know she will never forgive me.” Duke is reluctant to bring it up, his lips curving up with bitterness.
	He wishes he could go back and make it right. He swears he’ll trust her whatever happens to Joey.
	Duke did think about giving up to let go of Wendy.
	But how can he put her down as he knows Wendy used to love him.
	No wonder Wendy is clear about all his favorites.
	He used to take it for granted as Wendy was not so important to him. All he cared for was Joey Lan who saved his life.
	During the past five years, he used to come across her a lot, which he assumed was coincidental.
	It turns out that’s because Wendy loved him.
	The most miserable is that Wendy loved him before, but she doesn’t love him now.
	Eventually, Wendy turns to the other man’s hug after he squanders her love.
	Duke is miserably tortured by the truth with regret, but he’s too stubborn to quit. Even if Wendy’s family begin to despise him for coming around too often, he still shamelessly gets close to Wendy in the name of business collaboration.
	He never imagines he can swallow his pride in this way for a woman.
	“Come on, bro. Just let it go,” Bruce sighs and talks Duke into giving up.
	Wendy is too happy to care for Duke’s love.
	“Never! She had a great crush on me, and I’m sure that I’ll get her love again,” Duke says confidently and walks away.
	Bruce feels so speechless as Duke is too stubborn to accept the fact as Wendy loves Eddie instead of Duke.
	…
	Jamie steps into the lobby, but she doesn’t find Dan. The lobby is open-air with many beautiful tables and chairs of European style bathed in the perfect dim light, which is an exotic and romantic place to have dinner.
	But Jamie isn’t in that mood right now as she is hastily looking for her husband.
	Maybe Wendy mistook a stranger for Dan?
Chapter 418: Here I Am
	Thinking in that way, Jamie lightens up a little. She is looking around as a vase on the windowsill above her is about to fall.
	“It seems Wendy made a mistake.” Jamie sighed in relief as she doesn’t find any traces of Dan.
	Since Dan isn’t here, she’s going to leave for her home.
	When Jamie is about to make a step, there comes a screech, “Watch out!”
	Jamie turns around and finds Dan is walking toward her from the opposite lawn, with a sexy fashionable woman. Jamie can see shock fleeting across Dan’s gorgeous cool face as he darts to her.
	He is as fast as a cheetah as his files in his hands are thrown away.
	The woman left behind by Dan is startled and stares at the files with widen eyes, then she finds Dan hug Jamie in his arms, rolling back toward the lawn, just a second before a vase falls and crushes down on the ground where Jamie stood at.
	Deeply moved by the scene, the fashionable woman is flipped for a split second. Were Dan a single man, she’d like to marry him now.
	Dan holds Jamie tight in his arms, so Jamie curls up in his hug and remains intact under his protection. Even a trace of grass can’t be seen on Jamie’s body.
	Still, Jamie is shocked by what happened.
	The vase just fell to where she stood.
	“How are you feeling? Are you hurt? Is baby okay?” Dan checks over her body first to assure she isn’t hurt, then he asks her about the baby.
	Jamie looks pale with fright, even her lips are colorless. As frightened as she is, her baby in her body is safe.
	Clenching Dan’s collar tight, Jamie shakes her head.
	After assuring her safety, Dan stands up with Jamie in his arms. With his cold eyes, Dan grimly orders a waiter beside him, “Call your manager here.”
	The waiter instantly ran away to find the manager.
	Dan’s eyes shift to Jamie, whose face is creepily pale with fright. He gently pats her on her back to soothe her.
	Then he glances at the rooms upstairs from which the vase fell down.
	The windowsill is a dangerous place for a brittle vase. Obviously, someone took the liberty to move the vase owned by the hotel and purposely placed it on the sill.
	Soon there comes the manager. Taking in all the mess on the ground, he makes his way to Dan and looks at Dan flatteringly. “Boss Dan, what a great honor to have you here!”
	Dan looks at him grimly. “Cut the crap. I want to know who books that room. If you can’t make it, a lawyer’s letter will be the last thing you see.”
	Scared to death, the manager hastily answers, “Of course we will do you justice. I’ll let them investigate the accident right away. You have my words.”
	Dan shifts his eyes to the sexy fashionable woman and orders, “Linda, stay here to watch over for me. And carry out the project as we have planned.”
	“Yes, sir.” Linda nods and watches Dan hug his wife walking away. A fleeting of Jealousy hides behind her eyes.
	It must be a bless from God that Jamie Moore can marry such a thoughtful and powerful husband.
	Jamie becomes conscious and tugs at Dan’s clothes, weakly saying, “Put me down.”
	“Don’t play tough.” Dan frets over her. Although she’s not hurt, he is scared to death.
	If he didn’t find her there. If he didn’t notice the falling vase. If he was too slow to pull her aside.
	Every time he thinks of the falling vase crushing Jamie’s head, Dan speeds up his heartbeat as if he’s in his nightmare.
	He even doesn’t notice there are sweats in his palms.
	He can never bear to see some accident happens to Jamie in front of his eyes, not to mention Jamie falls down on the ground.
	Dan presses his lips together hard, a dash of violent frenzy accumulating in his eyes, while his cuddle remains warm and gentle, which isolates Jamie from his horrible mood.
	After confirming Jamie’s physical condition, Dan puts her down. Once Jamie stands on the ground, she finds her legs are too soft to support her body, and she has to lean against Dan’s hug, breathing heavily.
	Jamie is so terrified as she knows she won’t survive if the vase crushes her head.
	The very narrow scape makes her heart trembling, her lips colorless. Every time she closes her eyes, she can’t help but to picture it in her mind.
	The haunting horror overshadows the survival joy.
	“My dear Dan…” Jamie sobs and buries herself into his hug, tears trickling, voice trembling.
	“Here I am. Here I am.” Dan gently pats her on her back to soothe her, holding her tighter.
	He can sense she is terrified, and so is he, even worse.
	Although Jamie is intact in his arms, his thumping heart and deadly fear are still there.
	They stand in front of the hotel entrance and hug each other as intently as if nothing can ever separate them apart.
	Feeling Jamie’s fear and angst, Dan relentlessly soothes her, and finally calms her down.
	After all, Jamie has escaped from death for several times, from deep sea to snowy wilderness. Comparing to those desperate and deadly situations, the falling vase just a momentary scare.
	“Let’s go home.” Jamie sounds gentle with a bit snuffle. She finds she is too weak to walk when she comes out of Dan’s hug.
	Dan quickly holds her body and peeks over at the man looking over at them. Dan squints to the man to tip him off, then he says gently to Jamie, “Okay, let’s go.”
	Dan holds her tight in his arms and walks toward the parking lot.
	When they get to the manor, Dan’s parents have left. The villa swells with silence. All the rooms are in dark except the living room.
	Dan gets off the car with Jamie in his hug and goes upstairs. He carefully makes his steps light in case Bunny is awakened as he has to get up early for school.
	After turning on the heater, Dan steps into the bathroom to fill the tub with warm water and informs Jamie, “The water is prepared. Come and have a bath.”
	Jamie nods with her pale face, grabbing her pajama in Dan’s hands, and moves slowly into the bathroom.
	“Call me if you need help. I’ll be here waiting.” Dan intently gazes at her.
	Jamie shrugs her shoulders with blushing and instantly closes the bathroom door.
Chapter 419: The Wolf’s Countdown
	Dan doesn’t take off his black suit until Jamie closes the door. He throws it into the dirty clothes can and rolls up his blood-stained sleeve to his elbow. On his pale and muscular arm are several nasty scars with many pieces of the broken vase stuck in, with his blood trickling down.
	When they were in the hotel, Jamie was wrapped up by Dan’s body, but the broken pieces on the ground were stuck in Dan’s arm.
	Dan gets those pieces out of his arm with a tweezer, and some are inside his flesh, but his action is swift and clinical without hesitation.
	The blood oozes out of the wounds as the pieces are removed. There are sweats on his forehead, below which lies his bright black eyes.
	“Ah!” Jamie suddenly screams. Dan is startled and shakes his fingers working on his wounds, then he immediately puts his tweezer down and rushes into the bathroom.
	He knocks on the door, listening carefully to the sounds inside. “Jamie, what’s happening?”
	“No, nothing…” Jamie sounds a bit strained, but she gets quiet after murmuring to herself.
	She is about to get in the bathtub after taking off her clothes when she almost slips. She’s lucky that Dan has covered the sharp spots with thick and soft cotton in case she gets hurt.
	It’ll be a tragic if she slips and falls into the bathtub.
	Jamie lets out a sigh of relief, forcing down the way the startle speeds up her hearts, as Dan’s knocking on the door with his voice.
	“Are you hurt or something? Open the door.” Dan can’t hear any sounds and knows Jamie isn’t bathing. There must be something wrong inside the bathroom, making Dan worry about her.
	“I’m fine. I’ll finish it, soon.” Open the door? With her naked body?
	Jamie instantly blushes and shouts to Dan with cursory words.
	After seconds of silence between them, Jamie is about to rest easy when she hears the noise of unlocking the door.
	Did she just forget to lock up the door?
	Jamie stares at the door with widen eyes as she really wants to close it just like she always does, but right now with a baby in her body, she can’t make a swift move.
	Immediately, Jamie buries herself inside the big massaging bathtub wrapped around by the water. She sits up and leaves her small head and beautiful shoulders above the surface, her eyes flickering at the moving door.
	Then Dan walks in.
	He meets Jamie’s vigilant gaze, then he looks around finding no spilling water. Beside the tub are body-wash and bath sponge which remains dry, indicating that Jamie haven’t start bathing.
	Puzzling his brows, Dan shifts to Jamie in the tub. He can vaguely see her body under the water without foam on the surface, which is erotic enough to get him aroused.
	With throat bobbing, Dan stares at Jamie’s rosy cheeks which turns crimson in his blazing gaze, and the color of her shoulders becomes rosy, too, with the gentle curve, provoking Dan’s strong protective feeling.
	“What are you doing here? Get out. I have to take my bath now,” Jamie says exasperatedly with her glare as she feels strained in his unwavering gaze.
	But her coyly anger looks enticingly seductive to Dan.
	As his gaze is getting more intent and scorching, Dan isn’t leaving but moving close to Jamie with an alluring smirk. He picks up the bath sponge and says, “I’m helping you bathe.”
	“What, what, what the heck? I have claws. Yuck! I mean I have hands, and I can wash myself with them.” Jamie really wants to slap herself in the face as she stutters as Wendy does.
	Is stuttering infectious?
	“Then why did you scream?” Cocking a brow, Dan looks at Jamie, waiting for her confessions.
	“I…I just almost slipped, and I was startled…” Jamie murmurs, lowering her head.
	“Almost slipped?” Dan is worried. “Did you get hurt?”
	Jamie shakes her head.
	Dan gets a bit relieved and rubs Jamie’s arms with body-wash.
	“I, and you…” Jamie is dumbfounded. Is Dan washing her body?
	She thought he was teasing her. Now who knows…
	He rubs so affectionately that Jamie feels touched as happiness is bubbling in her heart.
	To keep Jamie warm, Dan quickly dry her up by wiping the water away from her body. As a result—
	His lust scraps at his inside with each demanding heartbeat.
	Dan is trying hard to suppress it, and his sour face amuses bashfully blushing Jamie who instantly puts on her smug face with sneer. Jamie circles her arms around Dan’s neck as Dan walks out of the bathroom with Jamie in his arms.
	“Only 25 days left,” Dan says in his magnetic deep voice, from which Jamie senses his restraint.
	Jamie blushes again and coyly punches his chest. What an insatiable wolf!
	Jamie certainly gets it when he says the number. Why does he make a countdown for that?
	Jamie can imagine the exhausting nights she’ll spend on Dan’s bed, and she can almost feel the horrible soreness, which makes her want to back out.
	Dan places Jamie in the bed and gently tucks her in, while Jamie grabs his hand as he’s about to leave.
	He pauses a second and notices Jamie is staring at his blood-stained sleeve.
	When he was rushing into the bathroom, he was so worried that he forgot to put on his coat to cover the sleeve.
	Jamie stares at his sleeve with doubt. “When did you…get hurt?”
	It seems that his wound is new as he’s a neat freak who can’t stands blood remaining on her clothes.
	“I’m all right. Don’t worry.” Dan flashes a faint smile and gently pulls his hand out of Jamie’s hand. “Sleep tight, and I’ll be back soon.”
	Then he turns to seat himself in the couch and holds the tweezer to pull out the rest pieces.
	In no way can Jamie sleep with worries. She gets up out of bed and walks to Dan on bare feet.
	The thick and fluffy carpet can keep Jamie’s bare feet warm.
	“Let me help.” Jamie feels sad when she finds Dan ruthlessly pull out pieces hard as if he can’t feel the searing pain.
	Dan looks at her and sighs at her determined gaze, and gives the tweezer to her.
Chapter 420: She’s the Aim
	“Are these the pieces of the broken vase?” Dan’s wounds are painful for Jamie to watch as if the pieces are stuck in Jamie’s heart.
	Dan responses with an affirmative hum.
	Jamie doesn’t remove the pieces swiftly or hard, but she’s experienced enough to ease his pain to the point where he can bear.
	Dan has to say his wife really gets the talent.
	“Who else did you help to deal with the wounds?” Dan sounds quite jealous.
	Because it seems that Jamie has done this before, and that’s why she’s so experienced.
	Jamie doesn’t tilt her head up or stops removing the pieces. “When we were in England, Bunny loved dismantling those machines and often got himself hurt, and I helped him with his wounds. Then I helped Ryan Jack deal with his.”
	It’s okay to help Bunny, but when Jamie brings about Ryan Jack, Dan’s face gets stone-cold.
	Dan’s unpleasant breath makes Jamie tilt her head up and look at him, putting the tweezer aside, as she finds Dan is jealous at what she says. Then she looks at him flatteringly. “Only twice for him, okay?”
	Dan doesn’t believe her, and his eyes shift to the sanitizer, gesturing to Jamie.
	Jamie gets it and dabs several cotton buds with the sanitizer to sanitize his arms with them.
	Then Jamie finds a bottle of herbal medicine powder and sprinkles it over his wounds little by little.
	A smile curves up Dan’s lips as he watches Jamie taking good care of him intently, and he wishes time could stop at this moment.
	After everything is done, Dan goes to sleep with Jamie in his arms.
	Unlike Jamie’s usual sleeping posture, she is willing to wrap Dan up with her arms and legs as tight as an octopus does, as if she’s afraid his escaping from her.
	Dan just follows her lead and holds her tight as he understands it’s owing to the falling vase, which makes Jamie feel insecure.
	Dan rhythmically pats her on her back. “Just sleep. Here I am by your side.”
	Then Jamie rests easy and flickers her eyes. Suddenly, she holds her hands out, cups Dan’s handsome face, and kisses hard on his light pink lips, then she quickly buries her face into his hug and closes her eyes sleeping.
	Now Dan’s really tortured by his scorching lust.
	He stares at Jamie’s figure intently and bitterly sighs, trying to push her away to calm himself down, but he is too addicted to her hug, making him hold her tighter.
	Dan doesn’t open his eyes until it’s next morning while Jamie is still sleeping sound. Dan gently combs Jamie’s hair with his warm palm, looking at her beautiful face in delight.
	After getting up, Dan tucks Jamie’s favorite puppet kitten into Jamie’s arms as his replacement, which was brutally thrown into the wardrobe last night due to his jealousy.
	Dan walks into his study.
	“Boss Dan, through the investigation, they find that nobody booked the room, while the security camera was broken just at that time, they don’t have monitoring footages.” Linda’s voice comes out of the video.
	Dan cocks his head to one side with his furrowed brows, listening to Linda’s report.
	Linda notices Dan’s unhappy postures, which upsets her a lot, and she’s afraid that Dan will fire her due to the fruitless investigation.
	Linda is the director in charge of the site design in CR, and Dan wants her to design for the event at the end of this month, which makes her pumped. However, the falling vase ruins everything.
	Dan thinks it over in silence, while Linda feels more and more terrible.
	“Sir…”
	“Does anyone book the room next to it?” Dan suddenly asks.
	Linda lets out a confused “Ah”, and she turns to ask the manager. “Yes, sir. The room on the right was booked, but the manager checks over the booking history and finds that the man has checked out after the accident.”
	Dan squints and says seriously, “Go to collect the man’s information, and I want to see his photo.”
	After around three minutes, Linda gets the related files, but she says with disappointment, “Sir, I’m sorry, but his ID card is counterfeited. Although we find him on other monitoring footages, he purposely left his back for the cameras.”
	It seems someone did it by design.
	And Jamie is the aim.
	Dan looks at the photos on his screen. The man in a black hoodie purposely left his back for the security cameras, which is too hard to recognize him.
	Dan cuts off the video phone and deliberates with furrowed brows.
	He doesn’t think it’s Ryan Jack as he’s sure that Ryan and Anna Pork have left Country C, and Ryan’s underworld has been taken by Bunny. It can’t be Ryan.
	Jack Moore is in the jail with 24 hours surveillance. It can’t be him, either,
	Then…
	Who’s the bad guy?
	Dan is lost in his thought when the study door flies open. Jamie unhappily looks at him. “I have heard you.”
	Dan is dumbfounded as he assures Jamie is sleeping. Then Jamie throws her puppet kitten hard at him and runs away with her feet shuffling in slippers.
	Dan instinctively feels Jamie is pissed off and that she misunderstands the video-call. Then he hears the sound of closing a door follow some loud noise.
	He walks out of the study and finds his pillow and quit are thrown out of the bedroom, lying on the ground.
	What the heck…
	Dan frustratedly arches his lips as he hopes it’s not like what he thinks, otherwise he’ll…
	“Sweetheart, open the door.”
	Dan tentatively swirls the handle and he finds Jamie locks it up from inside, which makes him at him wits end. She has got sensitive and capricious since she’s pregnant. She’s so spoiled that she dares to shut him out of his bedroom.
	Who has been spoiling her?
	Jamie locks herself in the bedroom and hides herself into her quit, pretending she can hear nothing.
	She instantly wakes up after Dan leaves the bedroom this morning. Maybe she’s a bit oversensitive recently and she can’t sleep tight without his company. So, she follows him to the study.
	And she finds he is on a video-phone with a woman.
	She’s overwhelmed by waves of sorrow, as if she gets suffocative in the water.
	She can’t stop sobbing. Although she’s dying to open the door for Dan, she refuses to see his face now.
	Debating in her own mind, she falls asleep in the knocks.
Chapter 421: He’s Restrained Himself for Too Long
	However, Dan doesn’t know Jamie is sleeping inside.
	He tentatively knocks the door, but there’s no replies.
	It seems he won’t sleep in the bedroom tonight.
	So what? Sleep in the guest room?
	Hilarious. He won’t sleep in the guest room as his wife is in the bedroom waiting for him.
	He’s lucky there’s a backup key.
	Dan feels proud of his wise idea of preparing another backup key for himself, which helps him a lot.
	--
	On the next morning, Jamie was furious as she finds Dan lying beside her.
	She jerks herself out of the bed and snatches the quilts off. “Dan William! How the heck did you get in?
	She believes she has the only backup key with her, but why does she wake up inside his arms every morning?
	Cindy also confirms that there’s only one backup key which is in her palms now.
	Then how can he get in the bedroom?
	“Come, on, sweetheart, it’s too early to get up.” Dan holds her hand and drags her back to his arms.
	He closes his eyes again, snuzzling in her hair, and her fragrance refreshes him.
	How can Jamie sleep? She exasperatedly glares at Dan who enjoys himself with her in his arms.
	“Dan Crap William!” Jamie is so irritated in his arms as if she wants to bite him hard on his jaw. “Let go of me!”
	Ignoring Jamie’s anger, with steady and even breath, Dan is not bothered at all.
	Jamie gets extremely furious as Dan doesn’t care about her emotion.
	“I won’t sleep with you unless you explain the whole thing to me.” Jamie pinches his waist hard to get rid of his strong arms.
	She can’t be that spineless, or she’ll get spellbound by Dan’s handsome. She almost forgets his affair in the hotel and the video-call with some woman last night.
	“What to explain?” Dan’s voice is deep with languid morning lust, making Jamie forget to get herself together.
	No! She can’t swoon over him right now.
	“Tell me, who’s she with you in the hotel, and who’s she on the video call?” Jamie doesn’t believe Dan cheats on her.
	If he wants, he could have cheated on her during the five years when she was not around. There’s no need waiting for her coming back.
	But when Jamie thinks of the woman’s sweet voice in the hotel, she’s jealously frustrated.
	He must hide a secret from her.
	They shouldn’t have any secrets as they are a couple.
	“Jamie, trust me. You’ll get the truth soon.” Dan opens his eyes and sighs, looking at her wrathfully turning away.
	“You said that days ago,” Jamie says coldly without turning to him”
	Dan’s lips twitches as he doesn’t know his secret plan can alienate Jamie from him. What if she changes her mind before that day?
	He should carry out the plan ahead of schedule before things get worse.
	He moves to her and gently turns her around to face him. Before she say any words, he seals her lips with his. He has restrained himself for too long.
	The kiss is passionate and lingering.
	Jamie feels like she’s burning on fire.
	Dan’s big palm slips into her pajamas, and he is surprised to find her daring habit.
	She doesn’t wear anything under her nightdress.
	Jamie is getting dizzy as her body becomes soft, and she bites Dan hard on his lips to vent her anger.
	However, Dan doesn’t let go of her, yet he kiss her harder, almost taking her breath away.
	The kiss is so long that Jamie thinks she’ll lose her consciousness, but Dan suddenly sets her free with erratic breath, his blazing gaze on her. Then he reluctantly turns away and steps to the bathroom.
	Jamie lies in the bed with jelly bones, her lips swollen, her breathing ragged. She feels too loose-limbed to move a finger.
	She knows what he’s doing in the bathroom. He has been there many times since her pregnancy…
	Serve you right! You shouldn’t have kept your secrets from me.
	Jamie made a face toward the bathroom. With her vigor back, she buries her face under the quilt and try to fall asleep fast.
	--
	As long as half a month has passed, Jamie’s morning sickness is getting more and more serious. She vomits almost everything she has, and the foods she doesn’t vomit are sour fruits. Dan really wants to take her place to suffer it.
	At the end of the month, Jamie doesn’t vomit too often, and she looks more vigorous with pale complexion and female charm.
	However, when it’s the third month in Jamie’s pregnancy, something happens.
	One day, Jamie just wakes up from her siesta, she finds her eyes are covered by something.
	She is about to move it away from her eyes when a pair of gentle and soft hands are placed on hers. “Stop it.”
	Jamie is startled as she realizes it’s Amelia William. What’s she going to do?
	“What are you doing?” Jamie sounds nervous and she instinctively protect her belly with her hands.
	“Just relax. Since I admits you’re my sister-in-law, I won’t hurt you. I just take you to some place.” Amelia says amicably with smile, looking at Jamie protecting her baby.
Chapter 422: There’s Something Missing
	After several months of mental therapy, Melia has got rid of her nightmare and approved of his brother’s marriage.
	Like Derek says, what’s past is past, and we shouldn’t hurt ourselves and people loving us with the painful history.
	Thinking of Derek, there’s a fleeting of happiness in the eyes of Amelia.
	“Where are we going? Where’s your brother?” Jamie asks hastily. Amelia doesn’t reply her, instead, she helps her stand up and walks her out of the room.”
	“We’re walking down the stairs. Mind your steps. Take your time…” Amelia carefully supports her to ascend the stairs and watches out for her steps in case Jamie trips over.”
	“…” Jamie gets more and more confused and wonders what’s waiting for her.
	Jamie is escorted into a car and leaves the manor.
	Jamie’s hearing gets better as she temporarily can’t see anything. She can sense that Amelia is sitting beside her, and she turns to Amelia to ask her, “Where are we going now?”
	“You’ll know it when you get there.” Amelia refuses to give Jamie the answer and comforts her, “Anyway, I won’t hurt you, and you have my words.”
	Jamie stays silent. Amelia’s therapy is arranged by Dan himself, and she gets her mental condition from Dan, which shows Amelia is stable enough to behave as normal.
	The journey takes so long that Jamie falls asleep, then the car stops at some place.
	Amelia helps Jamie get off the car and gestures an “OK” with her hand when she meets the man walking toward them, then Amelia helps Jamie walk slowly.
	“Where’re we now?” Although her eyes are covered, she can hear the sound of people walking by.
	Soon Jamie is brought into a room. Amelia waves to the dressers and stylists to let them in, with rows of gorgeous dresses and boxes of cosmetics.
	Amelia removes the band on Jamie’s eyes, “Hurry up! Come here. We don’t have time to lose.”
	Jamie squints and struggles to adjust to the light. Suddenly, Jamie is moved around by a dresser and surprisedly stares at all the dressers, who studies her pretty face for a moment and decides on a make-up fitting her, while stylists are dealing with her hair.
	“Amelia, what’s all the fuss about?” Jamie confusedly looks down at the powder brushes on her face.
	Make up? For some party?
	But she hasn’t been to parties since her pregnancy. Dan even cancels many business parties to look after her.
	“Which dress do you like best? This one? No, it’s too sexy, and it’s not your style. That one? No, it’s too plain…” Amelia takes no rest and walks around the dresses to pick up a perfect one for Jamie.
	But she can find nothing suitable.
	“Ah! Is that dress sent here?” Amelia stops a stylist and asks.
	“Miss Amelia, that dress was delivered by airway last night, and it’s about to arrive here,” the stylist answers.
	“What takes it so long? What if it’s late?” Amelia stamps her feet in anger, “No, I have to check it over and urge them to send it here quickly…”
	She opens the door and leaves there with whine.
	“Amelia…” Jamie is about to get up, but her dresser presses her down, seating her into the chair.
	“Mrs. Jamie, please stay still, or I can’t do my job.”
	Jamie has no choice but to swallow her questions and let the dressers adorn her face with fancy cosmetics.
	Obviously, the dressers, coming from abroad, are professional and skillful with deft hands. According to Jamie’s look and temperament, they exclusively make up her face to highlight her beauty and glamor, making her breathtakingly stunning.
	Looking at the delicate smiling face in the mirror, Jamie can’t believe it belongs to her. She knows she’s pretty, but now she’s perfect.
	The light make-up suits her air so well that her elegant beauty is attractively charming.
	“Mrs. Jamie, you are gorgeous,” the dressers praises by heart, fascinated by the glamorous beauty in the mirror.
	Jamie’s lips quirk up as she feels flattered. Although she’s not into make-up, but it does make her like a glamorous royal princess.
	However, she feels there’s something missing.
	“It’s coming! It’s coming! I get the dress.” The door suddenly flies open, and Amelia rushes in shouts, as well as many staffs with dresses in their hands.
	“Let’s see where’s that one.” In a daze, Amelia looks at those dresses and forgets the appearance of the special dress. Suddenly, it hits her, and she quickly grabs one to Jamie. “Go and try it on.”
	“What in the world are you…” Amelia pushes Jamie into the small dressing booth before Jamie finishes her question.
	Amelia anxiously waits for her outside and looks at her watch to check over the time, which is two o’clock in the afternoon.
	They’re lucky as there are at least two hours left for them. Her mission is to get Jamie busy doing something here.
	“Is the dress okay?” Although there are plenty of time for them, Amelia just can’t help herself being anxious and she urges to see Jamie in the dress.
	“Hold on. The dress is kind of complicated…” There comes Jamie’s frustrated voice.
	Finally, Jamie manages to knot all the ribands around her waist. After straitening up her dress, she comes out and stands in front of the full-length mirror.
	This is a pure-white silk evening gown, soft and light, and feels comfortable in it.
	It’s a sleeveless one with a small off-the-shoulder strap on one shoulder, from which myriads of red little rhinestones meander down, which brings out the pure white better.
	All the delicate patterns on the dress are woven by silvery threads, which are glittering in the sunlight.
	Around her waist are two red ribands tied into several lovely bowknots.
	It’s fits through the waist as it billows and kisses the floor with scallops, elegant but not too simple.
	Jamie looks at the gown and furrows her pretty brows, thinking it over.
	Amelia says it’s sent here from abroad. Is it some famous designer’s masterpiece?
	She doesn’t think so, as the gown’s design is kind of childish, even with a dash of dreamlike, making it looks very eyes-catching. Maybe the designer is fond of white, even the patterns are made of silvery-white threads. And the embellishments on the shoulder and waist brings out its glamor.
	She has to say it’s more of…a wedding gown?
	Plus, this gown…seems quite similar.
	Jamie looks to the mirror and deliberates for long, yet it doesn’t ring a bell.
	Anyway, she does love it.
	It can’t be a wedding gown. If Dan wants to marry her, he has to proposes to her first.
	Then what the heck is his plan?
	Jamie shakes her head and adjusts her ribands to stay loose around her belly, in case it’s too tight and hurts her baby.
	Then she opens the door and walks out.
Chapter 423: The Most Beautiful Place
	“Oh my gosh!”
	Everyone is stunned when they see Jamie.
	Whatever Jamie’s make-up lacks, obviously, her beautiful gown makes up for it.
	“Gorgeous!” Amelia’s eyes are filled with admiration. If she can, she’ll definitely asks Derek to proposes to her and marry her.
	Looking at the gown, Amelia wants to be a bride.
	“Well, Amelia, you haven’t told me why I am here,” Jamie asks, feeling strained as everybody is watching her.
	Amelia is willing to tell Jamie everything, but Dan asks her to keep the secret.
	“Hehe, I’ve told you that. You’ll get it soon. Take it easy.” Amelia pushes Jamie back to the dressing table wand waves at the stylists. “Come on. Come here.”
	They hastily scurry to Jamie and open up their portable kit to take out their tools.
	“Her hair doesn’t match the gown or the make-up. Hurry up and change it,” Amelia decisively orders, staring at Jamie in the mirror.
	Her hair looks perfect but it’s weird with the gown.
	Although Amelia isn’t a professional stylist, she grows up in a fashionable atmosphere, and she cares about fashion trend. As fastidious as she is, she does have a gift for fashion.
	The stylists follow Amelia’s lead and quickly remove Jamie’s headwear, designing a new hairstyle for her.
	“The gown is so beautiful. Who’s its designer?” Jamie wants to have some small talks with Amelia while her stylists are busy with her hair.
	Amelia confusedly looks at Jamie, “You don’t remember your own design?”
	“What?” Jamie is confused about her words and wants ask more, but Amelia turns to discuss something with a stylist.
	It takes them over two hours to finish all the girly stuff. Amelia covers Jamie’s eyes with the band again.
	Jamie doesn’t ask any questions as she is clever enough to guess it’s her husband whom she will meet. And all she has to do is to quietly follow the lead.
	Outside the manor, Amelia brings Jamie out of the car.
	Under their feet is a red welcome carpet goes all the way to the doorstep of the house.
	There are soft flower pedals on the carpet.
	Amelia leads Jamie to walk on the carpet, while herself is not on the carpet.
	Because it’s prepared for Jamie.
	Jamie can feel that there are soft things under her feet, which gets her more curious.
	“Amelia, where are we going now?”
	“To the most beautiful place in the world,” Amelia answers. She gently smiles as she finds a person walking to them to pick up Jamie.
	Jamie nods and quietly follows Amelia.
	“Jamie, I was wrong to hurt you, and I even pretended to make friends with you to ruin your life,” Amelia can’t help but to confess to Jamie as she is about to leave Jamie for the next person.
	Jamie cocks her head and prepares herself for Amelia’s confession.
	Amelia continues, “When I was a little girl, I regarded you as my sister, for you are outgoing and friendly, which made me feel good. Plus, I was impressed that you could defeat my brother in any argument.
	“I used to be so dependent upon you. Every time I made a mistake, I hid behind your back so as to avoid my punishment.”
	“But I never imagined that you could leave me there alone, yet you never came back to find me.”
	Amelia’s voice is calm with a touch of relief.
	It’s painful for Jamie to know the fact, and she holds Amelia’s hand tight and gently apologizes, “I’m so sorry.”
	“It’s all right.” Amelia shakes her head as they are closer to the man. “If I hadn’t been trapped in that warehouse for nights, I wouldn’t have blamed you. Every time I fell asleep, there would be the warehouses in my nightmare where I found nobody but endless darkness. Neither you nor my brother came to my recue when I screamed desperately in the dark.
	“The more nightmares I suffered from, the more hateful you became, as I blamed my mental illness on you. However, my mom didn’t blame you, and she just took me abroad and found a famous psychologist for me.”
	“I thought I’d recover from the phantom horror, at least forget you and your guilt, but I couldn’t make it. I just didn’t want to let it go.”
	Finally, they walk up to the man waiting for them. Amelia turns to Jamie and says, “I thought I’d hate you forever, even if I’d get rid of the nightmares, but you know what I wants to tell you most?”
	Amelia gently lays Jamie’s hand in the palm of the person and watches Jamie turns around, then Amelia says with smile, “Sister Jamie.”
	Jamie is deeply touched by the two simple words, tears trickling down her cheeks.
	“I hear you,” Jamie says without turning back.
	Amelia looks at her back and feels relieved as she has Jamie’s forgiveness.
	“Who are you?” Jamie tilts her head and asks.
	“Mrs. Jamie, it’s me.” There comes Alma’s calm voice.
	It’s Alma. Jamie gets relaxed. “Are you okay, Alma?”
	Dan tells Jamie when she was kidnapped by Ryan, Alma also disappeared. She has been worried about Alma as she hasn’t seen Alma’s coming back, but now Alma’s beside her.
	“I’m fine. Thank you, Mrs. Jamie.” Alma always sounds indifferent but not too cold.
	Jamie nods and follows Alma’s lead until the next one holds her hand.
	“Long time no see, Jamie.” Here comes July’s voice.
	Jamie gets more curious about Dan’s secret plan. Why do so many people come to escort her?
	“Yeah, like ages,” Jamie answers, “July, are there many people nearby?”
	She feels there should be lots of people gathering around, but she can’t see anything or hear any voices, which makes her wonder if she misreads the vibe.
	July glances around and gets surprised at her keen sense. However, she denies, “No. Just you and me.”
Chapter 424:Are We Getting Married?
	“Really?” Jamie Moore stops asking about the topic, instead asks her, "How is your relationship with my brother?"
	“I don't know.” July Summer's voice sounds a little distressed, thinking of the cold face of Chris Lockwood, she is upset.
	Why is he so cold to her while he is always smiling gently to Jamie Moore?
	No, no, Jamie Moore is his sister. Why is she jealous of his sister?
	July Summer shakes her head and tried to throw those unrealistic ideas out of mind, July Summer's embarrassment on her face finally disappeared.
	“You seem to be in trouble." Jamie Moore tells from July Summer's voice that their relationship has no progress, probably it relates to her loss of the family badge.
	However, Jamie Moore thinks she can be able to help her.
	“Cheer up. I think my brother likes you." Jamie Moore takes a thing out of the bag holding in hand, and passed it to July Summer.
	Looking at the ancient and solemn family badge lying on the palm of her hand, July Summer is excited about the lost treasure. “This is... I don't know how to thank you." July Summer says and gives Jamie Moore a gentle hug.
	Jamie Moore smiles, giving her hand to next person.
	"Let me guess who you are." Jamie Moore does not ask who the man is, but guesses by feeling, and then she smiles and speaks confidently, "You are Wendy."
	Wendy says in surprise, "How do you it is me?"
	"I've known you so long. Definitely I know it is you." Jamie Moore was quite proud.
	Wendy keeps rolling her eyes, even though Jamie Moore can't see it. She is surprised to notice the white dress on Jamie Moore.
	"I'm familiar with this dress." She seems to have seen this dress somewhere.
	"Do you think so? I think so too. But Amelia said the dress had just imported from abroad, we should not have seen it before." Jamie Moore becomes curious about what Wendy said.
	There is no answer.
	"Wendy, I've been trying so hard, you really should tell me where you're taking me." Jamie Moore looks pitiable with her mouth pouted.
	Wendy was softhearted.
	But she can't say it!
	"Well... don't ask me, honey, just follow me." Wendy decides to stick to the end and refuses to disclose.
	Jamie Moore is happy at once. What is it that can keep Wendy's mouth so shut?
	Is it a game of hawks catching chickens?
	When Wendy takes her hand to the next man, Jamie Moore feels that it is not like a girl's hand. It was big with thick cocoon in the thumb, which feels like a man's hand. Jamie Moore remains silent for a moment, sniffs her nose, and distinguishes the smell from the flowers in the air, "Brother, here you are."
	This is the only male she has ever met along the way. The man is her brother.
	"Jamie Moore, you are beautiful today." Chris Lockwood praises, looking at Jamie Moore his sister, like a delicate flower blooming. He feels a burst of relief, but also reluctant.
	"Thank you, brother." Jamie Moore smiles and makes a face. She holds Chris Lockwood's arm, and walks forward by her feeling.
	She has an intuition that it must be the most beautiful place in the world ahead, as Amelia said.
	"Jamie Moore, our family fair has not been settled, so father did not come. He is very sorry and he asked you to go home a lot." Chris Lockwood's voice is gentle and warm.
	"I know." Jamie Moore wonders why her father come, but never asks.
	Anyway, she'll know one day.
	She will asked about it.
	Chris Lockwood leads her far away, and suddenly stops.
	"I give my sister to you. You must treat her well, and do not let her be wronged, or I will be the first to come to you."
	She hears her brother talking.
	Jamie Moore frowns, and wonders who her brother is talking to.
	She reaches for the clothes or arms of Chris Lockwood, but she fails. She gropes for a while, but finds nothing. She stands in place helplessly, biting her lower lip.
	She is about to take back her hand, but suddenly she is caught by a pair of warm, dry hands.
	Jamie Moore is stunned, feeling from the familiar palm, her heart finally gradually calms down.
	It's him.
	"What are you doing, Dan William?" Jamie Moore smiles, although she could not see where he is, as long as he holds her hand, she feels very secure, not afraid no matter where she is.
	"Surprise you." Dan William approaches, does not help her remove the blindfold, but squats down.
	Jamie Moore feels a pair of hands straightening her skirt, and then the ribbon around the waist is loosened.
	The next second, her blindfold is removed.
	It is afternoon, the sun is shining brightly, the moment Jamie Moore opens her eyes, she feels dazzling. Then she sees the scene clearly.
	There is long red carpet, endless flowers, countless friends and relatives standing on both sides, smiling with blessing.
	Jamie Moore is touched and cannot say a word. The people around cheer up, and even whistle at Jamie Moore to marry him.
	Dan William looks at those people sharply, making people shut their mouth.
	"What the hell is going on here?" Jamie Moore presses her lips, being a little confused about the sight. But when she sees her skirt, she is suddenly shocked!
	The skirt on her body is clearly the one she has worn before, but after a while by Dan William, the skirt changes from tight to expanded, and also the skirt can actually be turned over. After flipping, the extra skirt is pulled up at the side waist, turning into a bright red flower.
	This is a wedding dress!
	Moreover, this is her number one dream wedding dress designed by herself.
	She said to Dan William at that time, this wedding dress is the best trick with two layers, the outside layer can be used as embellishment, while the inside layer is the main material.
	She was also very proud at that time, and promised to the man that, if this wedding dress comes out, it must be the most beautiful one!
	Yeah, it's really beautiful.
	Wearing it, she feels herself the most beautiful bride.
	“Take a guess.” Dan William does not answer her. In his dark eyes, there is a warm smile with the most touching tenderness.
	“Are...are we getting married?” Jamie Moore bits her lips and asks him with some shyness and expectation.
Chapter 425:Is This a Proposal
	Dan William nods, bends down and kisses her lips gently. Seeing Jamie Moore's delicate face, he smiles happily.
	“I... When did I agree to marry you?” Jamie Moore’s face turns red. She gently hits his chest, and whispers.
	How could this be? As a bride, she is the last one to know she is getting married!
	“Think deeply, did you really not agree?” The sound of Dan William is charming and affectionate, leading her to think involuntarily.
	“No... oh!" Jamie Moore wants to deny it, but some fragments slip through in her mind, causing her to shout.
	She remembers!
	It is last time!
	But can that be called a marriage proposal? No one proposed so perfunctorily by just asking, “Would you marry me?"
	"No diamonds, no flowers, no kneeling down, what do you use to propose to me?" Jamie Moore raises her chin and looks proudly at him like a queen.
	Since he asks her to be here, she needs to make it clear.
	Unexpectedly Dan William smiles mysteriously, taking her hand, walking forward.
	Jamie Moore finds that this is Dan William's family Garden, of which the decoration is different from before, so she does not recognize it for a while.
	Jamie Moore moves forward with curiosity, being stunned to see the slides on both sides.
	Those are pictures of her, as a child one year old, two years old, three years old...
	Each picture is clear, as if Jamie Moore's childhood reappears in this moment.
	Jamie Moore cannot help but cover her mouth, looking at these images, moisturizing eyes are wide open. Without Dan William's hand, she might not know where she is going.
	"These are your childhood photos, from a child till now. I picked up carefully one by one. Do you like it?" With a shallow smile on his lips, he looks at Jamie Moore with some expectation.
	Those are pictures he managed to find from Jamie Moore's family and her school, every picture is hard-earned.
	He wants to give her an ingenious wedding.
	"Yes, I do! How did you find them?" Jamie Moore looks at the pictures,with tears in her eyes, and cannot help hugging him and kissing his lips.
	When she was a child, she took a lot of photos, which have been put in a box under the bed. She and her mother are in the photos, though her mother only has a back or side view in order not to let people discover who she is.
	In Jamie Moore's impression, she and Dan William's photos were taken after high school.
	However, those pictures include that Dan William has been around her since she was two years old.
	From some angles, it looks like Dan William shot them and the pictures are beautiful and warm. One of her favorite photos recorded a picture. Dan William was about ten years old, sitting on the lawn with a book in his hand. She was four or five years old, rolling around him and there were traces of dirty fingerprints on his white shirt.
	"If I search carefully, I can find them." The tone of Dan William is faint. Although he searches for a long time, even buy some from other people with high price, so as to let her smile.
	Jamie Moore and Dan William do not go forward, the screens on both sides are still switching, Jamie Moore immerses in it.
	The most touching is that Dan William is with her.
	And for Dan William, the most grateful and touching is that she is still by his side.
	After playing, the huge screen is slowly put away to the right, revealing the scene inside.
	The manor of the Dan William's family is very big, Jamie Moore knows. Just now, along the way, there are two screens blocking her, and she doesn't know where she have gone
	She looks around and finds that this is actually the greenbelt of the manor. The greenbelt is trimmed by the gardener. It is neat and not piercing but soft.
	There are tables and chairs on both sides of the greenbelt, and a red carpet extends from Jamie Moore's feet to the end.
	William takes out a bunch of white roses. And there is an opened navy blue velvet box in the bouquet. The ring is placed in the velvet box. It is obviously the ring AordLover, which means lifelong love.
	This is the ring they once used for engagement.
	Jamie Moore is surprised, and then her eyes become watery.
	She once thought that their love ended with this ring, but now suddenly she realizes that this ring actually once again maintains their love together. Then Dan William kneels down on his knee, the arrogance and indifference in his eyes are placed with tenderness, "Jamie Moore, now there are flowers, a ring, and a handsome man, you will suffer a big loss if you disagree with my proposal."
	Jamie Moore snorts and can’t help laughing out. Noting that William is narcissistic and expectant to promote himself, she deliberately pretends to consider about it.
	"Marry him! Marry him!" A sound of booing comes from behind. Jamie Moore turns her head and sees Chris Lockwood, Wendy, Alma, July Summer, etc. These people clap their hands, shouting excitedly.
	"Mommy, Daddy is so sincere, say yes." Ian Moore is wearing a flower boy's clothes, makeup on his face and a flower basket in his hand.
	Handsome Ian Moore doesn't want to be a flower boy with other little girls, so the flower boy is only handsome Ian Moore.
	Ian Moore is excited. Before Jamie Moore came, he always followed Dan William to set up the scene and asked his people to help. This saved a lot of time.
	Jamie Moore's face turns red, and when she meets with his affectionate and serious eyes, she feels warm and no longer hesitates. "Take it, Jamie Moore, why are you stunned?" Wendy is dressed in a maiden dress, and beside her stands Eddie Charlies, who is dressed as a best man. She finds that Jamie Moore still staring at Dan William, can't help reminding.
	Jamie Moore comes back to her mind.
	"You only have one, and I have two, okay? My dowry is much more valuable than you." Jamie Moore has a rare opportunity to win Dan William, cannot help making a proud light hum, takes over the bouquet on his hands.
	She takes a baby and with another baby in her belly to marry him, of course, it is very cost-effective to Dan William.
	Dan William is touched, and he gets up.
	Guests invited sit down. And there is a wedding march, which is Avril's cold this be love, a favorite English song of Jamie Moore.
	Gradually flowers begin to fall from the sky. Jamie Moore's heart suddenly calms down.
	She's happy beyond all doubt.
Chapter 426: Can’t I Take Your Bride?
	It’s true that whether the bridal veil or the ring or the slide that was showed just now, they all make Jamie Moore feel that she is in her wildest dream.
	Bunny reaches out to them, holding a bunch of flowers from the flower basket and then tossing it up and down.
	The both sides are blessing the newlyweds, and they are smiling.
	These people are arranged by Dan William when Amelia delays Jamie Moore’s time. Thinking about Jamie Moore is pregnant who cannot be tired, Dan William chooses to invite the friends and relatives and some important business partners to witness this sweet moment.
	Jamie Moore and her husband stand in front of the godfather. The sky is blue, and the grass is green and the couples are the soul mates.
	When the godfather reads out the marriage vows, Jamie Moore feels a bit vacant. She suddenly comes to think of the things from five years ago to now, which makes her get a complex emotion.
	At the time when she left Country C, she told herself never to come back. And even she comes back, never will she contact with him.
	She was hurt and desperate at that time. But Jamie Moore never thinks that she will become the bride of Dan William.
	However, she never stopped dreaming about having a romantic wedding. Of course, every girl wants a wedding like this.
	When she doesn’t want to dream about it anymore, Dan William makes her dream come true. Just like sunshine, the actions warm her heart.
	Dan William works efficiently. But when did he start to arrange these things?
	When the godfather finished reading the vows, Jamie Moore has just promoted. So she answers gently but firmly, “Yes, I’d like to.”
	Then the godfather continues to read, and Dan William holds her hands tightly. Some scenes suddenly slip aside.
	The girl who has been loved by him for twenty years finally becomes an important part of his life.
	It can be said that Jamie Moore grows up with him. He witnesses her growing up from a dirty little girl to a fairy lady.
	He considers it a most lucky thing in his life to marry Jamie Moore and live with her till the old age.
	He arranges the wedding from a month ago, and he will take her to experience all the things in life.
	“Yes, I’d love to.” with a charming smile on his handsome face, Dan William responses in a clear voice when the godfather finishes his words.
	Then Dan William and his wife are asked to exchange rings.
	Wendy and Eddie Charlies stands on the either side, taking the ring boxes and waiting them to exchange the rings.
	Dan William takes up the ring, her wife put her hand onto his hand, and then he put the ring on Jamie Moore’s ring finger.
	Jamie Moore does the same thing.
	Two rings are just right. There will be no other two rings better than this two.
	“Kiss!” The guests start to heckling, staring at them with their sincere blessings.
	Staring at his parents with all his eyes, Bunny is more than happy to watch them kiss each other.
	“Oh! Bunny, you are not allowed to watch this scene!” Wendy fears that Bunny will be misguided to something, so she covers his eyes.
	The boy is speechless. He wants to watch!
	At the same time, all the people at the scene get hit to see the newlyweds kissing.
	“Wait!” suddenly a clear voice interrupts the kiss.
	Everybody looks back.
	Only to see a handsome man in his white suit walks towards the new couples.
	When this man walks closer to Jamie Moore, he is finally recognized.
	“Caro Jones?” Jamie Moore says in surprise.
	Why is he here?
	Caro Jones is in front of her, seriously looking into her eyes.
	“I am on behalf of my wife to thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to come here.” Seeing his white suit with smile in eyes, Dan William says.
	What?
	Caro Jones pauses.
	He’s not gonna bless them, he just wants to take Jamie Moore away if she is not treated well.
	But why does Dan William look at his clothes? Did Dan’s wife choose the wrong clothes?
	He turns his head sideways, and then he see that Eddie Charlies wearing the same white suit which is the suit of groomsman.
	Fuck.
	He was cheated by somebody.
	Caro Jones is very angry now.
	His suit was chosen by his butler, and he especially told the butler that he was gonna take Jamie from the wedding. But now...
	“The butler must mean to do this, he didn’t want me to take away Jamie!” he thinks.
	“Caro, so pleased you can come here and thank you for your blessing.” Jamie Moore’s smile is like a flower. Her sparkling eyes make Caro Jones dare not to meet her eyes.
	After seeing Jamie’s smile, Caro Jones refuses to say that he’s not coming to blessing them.
	She...looks very happy.
	What if he takes her away? Would that be too much trouble for her?
	Caro Jones is in silence. But actually he will not be able to take her away because there are so many people of Dan William at this enclosed estate. Moreover, how could he be so sure that Jamie will leave with him?
	In order to prevent the case like this, Dan chose to marry his wife at here. And the truth proves that he is right.
	“Jamie, are you truly happy?” silent Caro finally asked that pretty girl.
	When this question came out, everybody can’t help laughing.
	Don’t he see how sweet the smile on the bride’s face? The question is a waste of time.
	Bunny rolls his eyes. He doubts that this man is a rival of his daddy.
	“Hello, this unknown-man. My mommy not only has me, a clever and good-looking boy, but also is going to give birth to a cute baby. Don’t you think my mommy is very satisfied with it?” Bunny tilts his head, asking Caro with a childish expression on his face.
	Actually, the potential meaning within his words breaks Caro’s heart.
	Caro’s eyesight turns from the bride’s delicate face to her slightly raised but not very conspicuous abdomen. She is going to give birth to another new life?
	Caro starts to think that maybe he is in the wrong place now.
	So...
	If he cannot rob Dan’s beauty, he can just...
Chapter 427:He Lost to a Kind of Feeling.
	“Jamie, I’m here today to bless you. I wish you could be happy forever. Of course, I’ll always be there for you if you...need me.” Caro says slowly, observing the reactions of the couples at the same time.
	Jamie feels a bit embarrassed, and it seems that Dan William is going to be in a black mood.
	Giving the present to Wendy, Caro throws a kiss to Jamie and then leaves.
	Until now, everybody has realized that the bride is not only conveyed love by others, but is declared the affection in front of the bridegroom! He is challenged by Caro.
	Jamie looks at the way Caro left, who is so shocked that Caro would say such a kind of confusing words.
	And after seeing his wife is stuck due to another man, Dan William, whose eyes were darkening just now, turns her face to him in anger, saying in a peremptory tone, “You have already been my wife, so you are not allowed to watch men but me.”
	Jamie can’t help chuckling, “Dan is more than peremptory.
	But he is cute, all the reason he is jealous of Caro is because of me.” She thinks.
	“You’re handsomer than him, and I only like the most handsome boy.”
	Hearing this, Dan William feels better. He holds her hand and turns around, but another voice interrupts his wedding again when he is about to declare that the feast begins.
	He gets yellow looks on his face, seeing Ryan Jack is running over to him and his wife from a group of bodyguards.
	Though the bodyguards do well in their jobs, Ryan Jack escapes the catching with the help of Anna Pork and Twelve.
	It seems that it’s a wrong choice to cancel the monitoring after sending Ryan Jack out from Country C.
	When seeing Ryan Jack coming closer, Jamie is chilled, she is not as very happy to meet Ryan Jack as she meets Caro.
	Dan William turns his sight to watch Jamie, who is so calm, which gets his satisfaction. So he waves his hand to ask the bodyguards to leave.
	Therefore, Ryan Jack comes over to them easily. He looks tired, and seems that he had travelled for a long time. He must hurry his way to here overnight. Though he knows himself is tired, his eyes still bright. When seeing Jamie wearing wedding dress with happy expression, Ryan’s heart is broken.
	She looks beautiful, as it’s in his imagination. But all of her goodliness just show for one man.
	He have regretted that he told all the truth to her at that day and have also regretted that he had done so many things that hurt Jamie.
	But now, he can do nothing but to regret.
	Ryan Jack lifts the corners of his mouth, staring at Jamie. All he wants is an answer.
	“Jamie, if I met you earlier than Dan William did, can I be the person who stands by your side today?”
	All the guests’ eyes glaze over. Why do one-by-one-people cut the wedding off today? It’s maybe the truth that Dan William has many rivals in love.
	Dan’s mother sits by her husband’s side, looking at Ryan Jack with hostility. Anyone, who wants to take away her daughter-in-law is bad guy. She is relieved that the two of them had got their engagement already. Otherwise...
	Bunny plans to say nothing this time. After all, Ryan Jack was his foster father before, and he liked Ryan so much.
	Ryan had said that ‘two years’ is a vital point of his and Jamie’s life.
	He thinks that he is beaten by Dan William just because that only two years, which turns the result into a sad story that he lost Jamie. How can he be willing to give up her?
	Dan William holds his breath, observing Jamie’s thinking face, looking forward to her response. But he won’t doubt the true love between them.
	Because he knows, the question asked by Ryan Jack is only an assumption.
	“No. I fall in love with Dan just because of the feeling he has given to me. I love him, not depends on the time. Even though I know you earlier than knowing Dan, I won’t choose you either.” Jamie thinks for a while, and response the question with absolute certainty.
	“How do you know you won’t?” Ryan Jack says in sadness and a bit resentment. He’s been thinking that the only point he lost to Dan William is that ‘two years’. But Jamie tells him he lost to a kind of feeling and Dan William himself.
	Jamie pays no attention to his words. Thinking that she used to treat him as her best friend, she feels sad.
	“Never is never. What’s more, I have already become Dan’s wife, your question is not a truth but an assumption.”
	She responses the question in an official tone, looking back into Ryan Jack’s eyes calmly.
	Dan William is very satisfied with her answer. He holds Jamie closer to him by the waist, giving Ryan Jack a challenging look, “If you are coming to bless us, it’s ok. But if you’re here today to ruin the wedding, then you can leave right now.”
	“Blessing?” Ryan Jack’s hands clenched and then finally loosened.
	He had got his answer, so should he bless them?
	Just until now, Ryan Jack has realized that he gets no qualification to be her friend anymore, let alone hoping her to forgive him.
	“Well...I wish your love last forever till the twilight age.” Ryan Jack says slowly, his eyes are covered by sadness.
	It’s no doubt that he is so in sorrow. Forcing himself to stop loving Jamie is such a sorrow thing.
	But only he blesses her will he not be more disgusted by her.
	Jamie accepts his blessing and smiles at him.
	“Thank you.” Smiles sweetly, Jamie rests on Dan William’s shoulder.
	Ryan Jack nods his head and is starting to leave.
	“Wait. What about enjoying the feast with us? Your long journey time deserves it.” Dan William invites him in stride.
	Jamie is surprised at what he said just now.
	He just doesn’t want Jamie to regret. After all, Ryan helped her a lot when she was in Britain. He helped her only for getting her.
	Ryan Jack pauses. Finishing blessing them is his limits, he is sure that he is unable to bear watching how sweet they get married.
	But it may be the last chance to meet Jamie.
	“Ok, thanks for entertainment in advance.” Ryan Jack smiles, taking a seat at random.
	“Dan, are you making a fool of him?” Jamie swallowed saliva, thinking that it’s apparent that Ryan doesn’t want to stay at their wedding. But Dan invites him to join the feast until it is end.
	Oh my god, Dan is so ‘bad’.
	Dan William smiles at her, “No, I’m a good person.”
	A good person?
	No way, boy.
Chapter 428:Are You Being a Bitch?
	Jamie feels sick of his narcissism. If he’s naive, then the word “naive” is insulted.
	How can he be so brazen?
	It’s almost close to the dawn when the party begins. Today, the manor is a perfect wedding venue with beautiful decorations and considerate arrangements.
	It’s lucky for the guests to have a glimpse at the inside of the manor, and they walk around with great interest.
	Due to Jamie’s pregnancy, she needs to rest as much as possible, and Dan brings her back to the bedroom in his arms midway.
	“Hey, guys, you can’t leave. You should invite us to your bridal chamber with you two together,” Bruce expresses his dissatisfactions first when he notices Dan takes Jamie away, then he gathers others to follow the couple and visit the bridal chamber, which is their bedroom.
	“Yes, dude, you can’t go back to your bridal chamber without us,” other guests echoes.
	“Today is Boss Dan’s wedding day. I don’t think he’ll be irritated if we send the couple to their bridal chamber.” Some guests are afraid that Dan doesn’t like the wedding custom, so, they don’t have the gut to enter their boss’s bedroom.
	“It makes sense, but what if we scare the bride. She’s having a baby…”
	“Come on. We enter there to send our best wishes. It’s not a big deal.”
	“Yep. We do this for their blissfulness. Let’s go!”
	However, Bunny suddenly shows up and stops the crowd. Composed and determined, he stands in the way with his open arms, and you can find no traces of shyness on her face.
	Bruce notices Bunny is in front of the crowd and crouches to ask him, “Bunny, are you coming with us, too?”
	Then the crowd bursts out laughing.
	Bunny rolls his eyes and seriously says with his childish voice, “Come on. If you guys rush in to interrupt my parents’ business and get my mom startled, my dad will definitely throw you out.”
	Everybody there can picture the horrible scene as Bunny reminds them, which scares them to death.
	But Bunny doesn’t get enough, and he continues, “Well, I won’t stop you if you make up your mind to get in the bedroom. However, as for the consequences…”
	His words end at a cliffhanger to entice the guests into filling the blank in their mind, which builds up the fear.
	“Damn it. No, we’re not going to bother them at their romantic moment. It’s private moment. Why should we ruin it?”
	“No, we’re not. We are not that kind of bitches. ”
	“Mrs. Jamie is too tired, and we should leave her with his husband. We’d better not bother them.”
	“Well, I haven’t been to that place. Excuse me. I have to leave to take some pictures of the venue.”
	“Wait! I’ll go with you.”
	The excited guests dying to go into the bedroom all scatter away. Bruce can’t believe what happens. Seriously? A bunch of adults are scared by a child?
	“Bunny, don’t you want to know what your parents are doing right now?” Bruce wants to elicits Bunny’s answer. He wants to tease Bunny on the spur of moment as Bunny looks exactly like Dan.
	“Of course.” Bunny tilts his head up and says.
	“So, what are they doing?”
	“The things you don’t know, Uncle Idiot.” Bunny glimpses at Bruce with distain, which embarrasses Bruce a lot.
	Why should he be fooled by Dan’s son?
	Why should Bunny call him “uncle”? He’s younger than Dan.
	“Well, I get it. You don’t know it, either?”
	“Uncle, if you want to elicit information from me, then I’ll tell you,” Bunny shakes his pointer finger and grins, “no way!”
	Bruce is really riled up now. However, Bunny’s cute face with innocent expression looks too adorable to get angry with. “Do you want to come with Uncle Bruce, yuck, Brother Bruce to peep at what they are doing?”
	He never imagines he is brainwashed by Bunny and call himself an uncle.
	Bunny tilts his head to one side and thinks it over, while Bruce is expecting his positive answer. Then Bunny parts his lips with white teeth exposed. “Uncle Bruce, don’t tell me you’re a Peeping Tom.”
	A Peeping Tom?
	“What are you talking about? It’s not cool, kid.” Bruce trembles with anger and pinches Bunny’s face as if he wants to eat Bunny.
	“You’re bullying a child. It’s not cool, Uncle Bruce,” Bunny whines and frowns.
	Bruce doesn’t loosen his pinch until Bunny frowns, and he teases Bunny again, “Bunny, let me tell you something you don’t know. Whatever your parents are doing now is what you are going to do with your wife. So, still not interested?”
	If Bunny breaks into the bedroom and interrupts their pleasure, Dan has no choice but to swallow his anger as Bunny is his daring son.
	And that’s the reason why he coxes Bunny into the bedroom.
	But someone suddenly clasps at his collar and pulls him up. “Bruce, are you being a bitch and fooling little Bunny?”
	It’s Wendy’s voice with a bit of anger. She has enough strength to push Bruce away at one shot.
	“My poor Bunny. Don’t believe the pervert’s sweet talks, or you’ll be fooled.” Wendy holds Bunny tight in her arms to comfort him.
	Bruce stands up and straightens his shoulders, but he feels sad when he hears Wendy’s word.
	A pervert? He?
	Bruce frustratedly walks over and pats Eddie’s shoulder. “Eddie, your wife is so strong that you must have beaten by her a lot at home.”
	Obviously, Bruce is sowing discord between Eddie and Wendy.
	Eddie glimpsed hat him with distain and happily says, “It’s my pleasure.”
	“Oh! You’re so sick. You’re doomed, bro.” Bruce can see that Wendy is spoiled by her husband.
	“Auntie Wendy, what’s the thing that I’m going to do with my wife?” Bunny asks in an innocent tone, blinking his wide eyes.
	Wendy turns around to face Bruce with a glare, as Bruce is such a jerk to mislead Bunny.
	Bruce feels he is set up by Bunny who purposely asks Wendy the question.
	But he fears Wendy’s penetrating glare, and he gives up defending himself.
	“Well, it’s actually…” Wendy brainstorms to find an innocent word to describe love-making, finally, she thinks of one. “Game! Yes, it’s just a game.”
	“So, are my daddy and mommy playing a game together?” Bunny pursues with his unyielding heart.
	“Well, yep, your daddy and mommy are playing a game, so we can’t bother them now, or they’ll lose the game,” Wendy explains with her serious expression, but her rosy cheeks betray her word.
	Bunny lets out a fake sigh of relief, which makes Bruce believes Bunny has no more questions. But amusement dances behind Bunny’s eyes before it slips away, and Bunny asks, “If it’s just a game, why does Uncle Bruce want to bring me to peep at it? We can watch the game fair and square.”
	What? Peep?
Chapter 429:Why do You Marry a Badass?
	Wendy turns to face with her eyes filled with distain and loathing as if she’s saying stuff like “You’re a damned Peeping Tom?”
	“I…” Bruce feels he’s wronged. He’s definitely not a Peeping Tom, though he does want to see Jamie and Dan make out.
	“Bunny, remember to stay away from the pervert uncle, okay? You know guys like him have mental disorders,” Wendy says, pointing at her head with index finger.
	“Of course, Auntie Wendy.” Bunny nods.
	“Eddie, why do you marry a badass?” Bruce rubs his forehead as his confidence is destroyed by Wendy.
	“Anything she likes,” Eddie briefly answer, which chokes Bruce’s word and drives Bruce away.
	Bunny gives Wendy a five as they defeat Bruce together.
	“Auntie Wendy, Bunny has to leave now. See you!” Bunny kisses Wendy on her cheeks like a gentleman, and leaves her.
	“See you.” Wendy waves her hands. Bunny can really pump her up.
	Eddie spoons her from her back and snuzzles her cheek. “I wonder what’s the game you were talking about…”
	For a split second, Wendy blushes scarlet, and she’s embarrassed about the word she told Bunny. “That’s only a stopgap. I can’t tell the truth to a child.”
	If she tells Bunny about the “game”, Jamie will kill her. Although Jamie is pregnant, she can be aggressive as she can.
	Eddie groans and erotically bites Wendy’s ear, giving a shiver to Wendy. “Honey, when shall we have a baby as adorable as Bunny?”
	A baby? As adorable as Bunny?
	Wendy lowers her head bashfully, contrasting sharply with her image of a tough girl. Now she looks like a pretty little woman.
	Eddie runs his hands to Wendy’s underbelly and gently circles on it. “Maybe we’ve got one here already.”
	Wendy gets coy. “Shut up. Absolutely not.”
	“Why?” Eddie squints and dangerously looks at her.
	“It’s my body. If I have a baby, I’ll sense it. Plus, I don’t want a baby now. It’s painful to deliver a baby…” Wendy murmurs.
	Jamie has told her about the feelings of delivering Bunny. It sounds like a hell which she is scared to go through.
	Eddie smirks, “Little fool.”
	His eyes are glued to Wendy’s underbelly with unassuming gaze. Wendy may have been pregnant.
	…
	Dan holds Jamie to the bedroom on the third floor, which is their true bedroom he prepared at the very beginning.
	Seeing they’re walking to the third floor instead of the second, Jamie confusedly asks, “Where are we going?”
	“Our bridal chamber.” Dan answers with smile and strides forward.
	Only one room separates their bedroom and Bunny’s room. But Dan hasn’t told Bunny the good news as he doesn’t want him to bother them.
	If Bunny knows Dan’s thoughts, he will be exasperated and regret helping his parents to stop the guests coming to their bedroom.
	Dan’s answer assures Jamie, and Jamie snuzzles his neck in his hug.
	Dan pauses a beat and lust radiates from of his eyes.
	He can’t resist her tantalizing.
	He takes her right to the end of the hallway, while her body feels softer and softer.
	Jamie has changed many dresses today. Now she’s wearing a strapless emerald mermaid dress with a deep V-neck. The dress is snug enough to make her plump breasts and upward-tilted hips pop, which can’t be too seductive.
	Dan’s sensuous throat is bobbing when he pushes open the door and walks in.
	The bedroom is arranged and decorated to Jamie’s preference. There is a round bed, gauze curtains, and starlight lights. On the floor lies a pure-white woolen carpet, soft and warm.
	Obviously, this bridal chamber is much better than the old bedroom. Jamie loves it at first sight.
	“So, you are the designer of this one? Why didn’t you tell me?” Jamie can’t help herself taking off her shoes and stepping on the comfortable carpet.
	“I have prepared the room for you before you came here, so you can’t know its existence.” Dan looks at her running around affectionately, fearing that she trips over, and that’s why he purchased the thickened carpet.
	Jamie won’t get hurt if she falls down on the thickened carpet.
	“Before I came here?” Jamie pauses a beat with surprise. Holy grief! He does have a secret plan in advance.
	What else has he deliberated?
	Jamie walks up to him and tilts her head to ask him, “What if we don’t get together? Then your plan is a waste.”
	Dan frowns at her “we don’t get together”. Silence spills between them before Dan says, “No, it isn’t. I have a feeling that it will be our bridal chamber.”
	Jamie revels in his word and coyly whines, “Nonsense.”
	Then she quickly runs away to the French sash and draws the curtains open.
	For a split second, she is surprised before exhilaration takes charge of her.
	Outside stands a beautiful swing chair with flower vines, which is designed by her mother in Moore family. It’s her personal present.
	When she was a little girl, she loved to snuggle up with her mother in the swing chair, where her mother affectionately watched her laugh lightheartedly.
	That’s her precious memory.
	Jamie feels the tears rising while she is touching the beautiful flowers.
	Dan resigns to her sorrow and pinches her upturned nose, “Little fool, I’m not doing this to earn your tears.”
	Jamie sobs into his hug and inhales deeply his scent to comfort herself. “Thank you so much, Dan.”
	“Are you thanking your husband?” Dan’s voice is gentle yet magnetic with a touch of lust when he holds her hand and gently kisses it.
	“But…I don’t prepare anything for you,” Jamie murmurs with a pout. She doesn’t even know about the wedding.
	Holy grief! What kind of bridesmaid is she?
	She frustratedly punches Dan in his chest.
	“You have presented me with the best gift.” Dan holds her strumming hands with his lips quirked upward. Chill runs through Jamie as Dan’s warm breath brushes her ear.
	“What?” Jamie feels limb-loosened leaning in Dan’s hug with her chest moving up and down. Alluring groans slips out of her lips while Dan is gently kissing her.
	And it occurs to her that her critical stage has passed since today.
	Yuck! What an insatiable wolf!
	“Yourself.” Dan’s voice gets husky, and he can’t suppress his lust anymore.
Chapter 430:Together Forever
	He bends and scoops her in his arms, striding into the room.
	Suddenly, Jamie is thrown into the bouncy bridal bed.
	Her face is blushing crimson while desire, thick and hot, pools in her belly. Burned by Dan’s blazing gaze, she hastily buries her face in her hands.
	She can never get too coy.
	“I, I haven’t taken the bath. You…
	“Together?” Dan arches his brow and locks her beneath his body with his arms popping him up on each side of her, leaning closer to her.
	He quickly seals her lips with his before she can refuse.
	“Hmm…” Jamie has to follow his lead as Dan’s kiss is so demanding that she can’t make a word.
	Dan’s hands move their way across Jamie’s torso while Jamie feels her skin burning. Every touch gives her an unexpected shiver and surprise.
	Looking at Jamie’s coy face, Dan’s gaze gets hot and intent, a satisfied smile on his face.
	How lovely. They will get together forever and always.
	…
	The next morning chill wind blows in, which makes Jamie in sound asleep pout with dissatisfaction. She tries to grab her quilt, instead, she touches a warm body and moves herself close to it, holding it tight in her arms.
	Which wakes Dan up, bending to gaze at Jamie’s tired but cute face. Delight coursing through his body, he tucks her in and holds her tight to sleep again.
	But Jamie isn’t still. From time to time, her hands move around. If she’s not sound asleep, Dan will think she do it purposely to tantalize him.
	It’s bittersweet for Dan to holds a sleeping beauty in his arms right now…
	Everything in the new bedroom is shining gold in the bright noon sunshine which is coaxing Jamie into opening her eyes.
	Dan’s handsome face first comes into her view, so freaking hot.
	Jamie’s heart starts to pump. She reaches out her hand and runs it down Dan’s cheek. When she touches his lips, Dan parts them and bites her finger.
	His tourmaline-black eyes are so intent that she almost lost herself to them.
	“Want me again?” Dan’s voice is husky. He stares at her face to look into her expression.
	Jamie blushes less red than usual, but she doesn’t forget last night’s exhaustion. More sex? She won’t get up from the bed.
	“You don’t have to work today?” Jamie tries to shift Dan’s attention.
	Dan doesn’t like the redirect, but he answers her, “I won’t waste my day after my wedding day on the job.”
	What a boss!
	Jamie whines in her mind.
	“Who’s going to support the family if you don’t go to work?” Jamie moves her body and bellows as she feels freaking sore.
	Crap! The bastard never learns to restrain his lust.
	Dan finds her face is crumpled and anxiously asks, “Are you okay?”
	Jamie shoots him a frustrated glare as she is too coy to tell him sex stuff, so she shakes her head. “I’m fine.”
	“You don’t look fine. So, you’re going to tell me, or I check it by myself?” Dan doesn’t believe her and wants to check her body.
	Jamie blushes and coyly dodges his gaze. Finally, she murmurs with couple of words.
	Her voice is too small to hear the words clearly.
	But Dan makes it, and he cares for Jamie so much that he hastily shuffles to the nearby desk cabinet in his slippers, fishing for some ointment.
	When Jamie sees the ointment, she blushes and stammers, “I can apply it by myself.”
	Dan doesn’t say anything to turn down her requests. His gaze becomes intent again as he slides the quilt off her body and looks at the bruises on her pale skin.
	“It’s my bad to make you hurt. I should take the blame and make up for my mistake.” Dan just wants to touch her skin, but he pretends to be innocently sincere.
	“…” Jamie shrugs her shoulders and screams in her mind. If he’s really upset, he won’t be so thirsty on the bed.
	Words don’t help her bruises. Jamie has no choice but to wait for him to apply the ointment to her skin.
	“Jamie, is there any place that you’re dying to visit?” Dan puts the ointment aside and looks at the clock in the wall. It’s only ten o’clock. He lies back into the bed and holds Jamie in his hug, enjoying the precious moment.
	Jamie thinks it over and flickers her eyes with a smirk. She says, “Greece. I want to visit Santorini.”
	Along the Aegean stand white houses with sapphire ceilings, which is a perfect place to spend their honeymoon.
	Jamie sneers as she finds what Dan really wants to ask about is her dream place for honeymoon.
	Dan remembers the name of the place in silence.
	--
	However, the birthday of Jamie’s baby comes first.
	The members of William family all anxiously wait outside the operation room.
	Even composed Dan can’t help himself walks back and force.
	“Daddy, calm down. Mommy will be fine.” Bunny also worries about her mother, especially after he knows the great pain to deliver a baby, so he determines to take better care of Jamie and his baby sister.
	Dan finally stops pacing and leans against the wall with restrained sorrow on her face.
	When everyone is anxious about Jamie, suddenly, they can’t hear Jamie’s screaming, instead, a baby’s crying sounds from the operation room.
	“That’s the baby.” Dan’s mother is excited about the crying and looks at the operation room.
	Dan deeply sighs in relief as Jamie has successfully gone through the hell.
	Several doctors open the door and carries Jamie out with the baby in a nurse’s hug.
	Dan walks to Jamie and gently holds her hands. Looking at her pale face, the sorrow grows thick in his eyes. “Thank you, Jamie. I’m proud of you.”
	Jamie heavily breathes and flashes a smile at him. “It feels better than the last time…”
	“Mommy, I’m proud of you, too.” Bunny says sweetly and kisses her cheek. He is too busy caring about her mother to check the baby’s gender.
	Girl or boy, he determines to love the baby forever.
	“My dear Bunny…”
	The nurse takes her into a VIP ward which is heaven for women after delivery as there is the best equipment with quiet and clean environment.
	Then Dan’s parents hurry back to home to prepare soup for Jamie. Wendy and Eddie stays here to look after Jamie and the baby.
	Which makes Duke wants to stay here, too, with Bruce together.
Chapter 431:Don’t Look at Other Men
	“Jamie, your baby just looks like a mini Jamie.” Wendy hugs the baby and pinches her cheek, while some magic feeling infuses into her body through her finger.
	Wendy hugs a baby as if she holds her own baby in her arms. It seems like the grace of maternal love ripples out of her, which makes Eddie touched.
	“If you like babies, why not have some with Eddie?” Jamie banters.
	Wendy carefully puts the baby beside Jamie and glances at Bunny who is standing on his tiptoes to watch her sister. “Bunny, your dream comes true now as you have your dreaming baby sister.”
	Bunny does want a sister, still, he tilts his chin up and says, “I can love a baby brother, too. So long as he’s my parents’ child, because their children are good kids.”
	“You know you’re praising yourself, right?” Bruce gets amused with laughter. If Dan weren’t here, he’d pinch his chubby cheeks.”
	Bunny ignores his remarks and runs to his parents. “Daddy and Mommy, what’s the baby’s name?
	Dan affectionately looks at Bunny and the baby while he is running his hand down the baby’s gentle cheek. He feels unbelievably amazing.
	The baby is sleeping soundly with her eyes closed.
	“What about Sunny? I hope she can be like the sunrise, warm and beautiful.” Dan gently holds her daughter’s hands with affection filing his face.
	Dan’s affectionate gaze touches Jamie who wants to kiss Dan so much, but she’s too exhausted.
	“Mommy, I’m your bunny. What about the baby?”
	Jamie arches her brows, and a smile curves her lips. “She’s my kitten.”
	What?
	A kitten?
	Bunny is disappointed. “Why are we both baby animals?”
	He shifts his eyes to Dan to ask for help.
	“Kitten is good. I love this nickname.” Dan agrees with his wife and ignores Bunny’s gaze.
	Looking at sad Bunny, Wendy says, “Bunny, you mother is a crazy fan of baby animals. I’m afraid her next baby’s nickname is also a baby animal.”
	“Bunny’s debating face is cute.” Bruce suddenly wants a baby when he looks at Bunny’s cute face.
	It must because his lack of sex. Now he’s insane.
	“…” Duke is silent while his eyes are glued to Wendy’s smiling face with fleeting pain.
	Eddie notices Duke’s stare and quietly blocks Duke’s gaze.
	“Guys, Jamie needs to rest, and you may leave now.” Dan notices Jamie is a bit sleepy.
	“Fine, I’ll come and watch my goddaughter next time. See you.” Wendy has become Bunny and Kitten’s Godmother.
	“See you.” Jamie waves at her.
	But Wendy passes out and falls to the ground as she stands up.
	“Jamie?” Eddie hastily holds her in his arms.
	“Is she okay?” Jamie is shocked. But Dan presses her down when she tries to get up from the bed.
	“I…I’m fine. I just felt dizzy. Not a big deal.” Wendy rubs her eyes. There’s something wrong with her these days as she’s been vomiting and over-sleepy.
	“Go to have a check. I’m worried about you,” Jamie says anxiously as she looks at her pale face.
	Wendy shakes her head. “No. I’ll go back to sleep…Eddie?”
	Wendy breaks off as Eddie scoops her up and strikes outside.
	Duke quickly holds back his hand reaching out to support Wendy and follows their steps with Bruce after nodding at Dan.
	Jamie stares at Duke unassumingly, but Dan moves her face to face him. She looks at him confusedly. “What are you doing?”
	Dan whines with fake irritation, “Don’t look at other men. Just look at me.”
	Jamie is amused, and she laughs. “Why?”
	“I’m more handsome than other men.” Boss Dan is quite confident.
	“Fine. You’re the most handsome man,” She nods as she does think so. “I’m just worried about Duke who may hurt Wendy.”
	There are obsession and bigotry in Duke’s eyes. It seems he haven’t give up his love for Wendy yet, which makes Jamie upset.
	She is afraid that Duke hurts Wendy to possess her as possibly as he hates Wendy for breaking his heart.
	Anyway, Wendy has left a nasty scar on Duke, and Duke may ruin Wendy’s happiness at all costs.
	“Take it easy. They’ll fix it by themselves,” Dan comforts her.
	“Duke may be aggressive, but Eddie is also a badass who can protect Wendy.” Dan doesn’t promise Duke will leave Wendy alone, but he thinks Eddie will protect Wendy.
	Both Dan and Eddie know that Duke may look indifferent with love, but once he is crushed on a girl, he’ll never give up on her.
	No one can tame the monster inside him except himself. His obsession with Joey Lan is the best example. He was deadly heartbroken when he found Joey had deceived him.
	“If he hurts Wendy, I’ll make his life a living hell.” Jamie clenches her fists tight as Wendy is her best friend, and no one can hurt her.
	“Okay. I get it. Just go to sleep. Leave it to them,” Dan says, his hands combing her hair gently.
	Jamie quickly falls asleep as she is very exhausted today.
	--
	After the check, Eddie still reels from the result as if it’s untrue.
	Wendy is upset about his changing expression, trying to figure out his thoughts.
	Is he…regretted?
	Wendy’s face gets pale and quietly follows Eddie, waiting for him to arouse from the shocking result.
	Mayhem stirred up in her mind, she walks with her lowering head, but suddenly, she bumps into a warm chest.
	She raises her head and meets Eddie’s exhilarated smile.
	“Come on, Wendy. Pinch me, so I’ll see it’s not a dream.”
	Ha, ha!
	Wendy suddenly laughs out and pinches Eddie hard at his waist.
	It’s a rare moment to see Eddie’s dumb face, and he murmurs to himself, “I’m not dreaming. It’s not a dream.”
	He holds Wendy into his arms tight, but he instantly pushes her away as if he thinks of something important. He looks at Wendy’s underbelly and asks anxiously, “Did I hurt you?”
Chapter 432:Always Love You
	Wendy’s anxiety gradually starts to lift as she finds Eddie does care for their baby. With a small smile tipping the corners of her lips, Wendy can’t help but stand on her tiptoes and gently kiss Eddie on his lips. “I’m fine. You know I’m a tough girl.”
	The doctor just tells her she’s been pregnant for over two weeks.
	So, she doesn’t feel right for her pregnancy?
	Wendy didn’t discover it as she has zero experience about pregnancy.
	But Eddie still worries about her and the baby. He feels guilty of yesterday’s fling. “Sorry, I didn’t know…And you’re not allowed to do it again during your pregnancy.”
	Lucky them the baby is still safe.
	Now, it’s too easy an inclination of Eddie to punish Wendy for her recklessness. But the love for her appeals in equal.
	“What? I can’t. Those are part of my life.” She can’t give up on her games easily, but for the sake of the baby, she can temporarily keep away from them.
	“Yes, you can,” Eddie orders ruthlessly as he gently takes her waist while walking.
	A smile curves Wendy’s lips as Eddie’s tone rarely leaves little to debate unless in terms of major issues. Usually he is willing to accept her opinion.
	“Plus, we’ll have our wedding as soon as possible in case you run away from me with the baby like what Jamie did,” Eddie says while he’s planning the wedding in his mind.
	“…Jamie was at the end of her rope, okay? And I don’t think I can run away with an unborn baby.” Nothing will separate her from Eddie unless she wants.
	--
	It has been a month since Kitten came to the world. Dan’s parents throw a birthday party for kitten and invite many guests over to share their joy as they really love Kitten.
	Bunny holds Kitten in his arms and walks through the crowd, subtly dodging the touch with others. And Kitten sleeps soundly in his hug.
	“Come here, Ian.” Dan’s mother waves at Bunny who wears a decent suit with a red bow tie.
	“Oh, here comes my adorable grandson and little Kitten!” Dan’s mother didn’t know why Dan and Jamie call the baby Kitten, but now she figures out that the baby does look like a little kitten.
	The birthday star, Kitten, is sleeping soundly in Bunny’s arms with a bubble blown out of her mouth, which looks so adorable that make others want to pinch her chubby face.
	Dan’s mother holds the baby away from Bunny’s hug and says, “I’ll look after her, and you should go to take your parents here.”
	“Grandma, Ian can’t go upstairs to bother my parents now,” Bunny says seriously with his earnest expression.
	Dan’s mother gets confused and asks, “Why?’
	“Because Uncle Bruce tells me my parents are kissing and he wants me to peep at them, but I don’t want to be a pervert.”
	Bunny’s word can’t be too naive or innocent.
	Bruce is about to cover Bunny’s mouth when he notices Bunny explains to Dan’s mother, but obviously, Bunny doesn’t leave him any chance and rattles it off.
	Suddenly, the people in the hall break into laughter after seconds of silence, while taunted and accusing eyes fall on Bruce.
	What a naughty boy! Bruce is riled up and glares at Bunny. He feels more embarrassed than he was caught having an affair with a movie star.
	While everyone is having fun downstairs, Dan and Jamie are having fun upstairs.
	Jamie is slim again after a month of recovery, but she’s not slim enough to zip up her dress easily.
	Like now, as hard as she tries, the zipper makes no movement.
	“Ah!” Jamie screeches as the dress suddenly cinches her in, while she’s zipping the dress up.
	She feels frustrated. “Holy crap! Dan, I ‘m so fat.”
	Now she’s coyly whining for Dan’s flattery.
	Dan scoops her from behind and gently kisses her hair. “I think you’re perfect. More plump and sensuous.”
	His flattery is too erotic.
	“Let go of me, big pervert,” Jamie reminds, shimmying her body.
	Dan squints a bit with his languidly satisfied face and gently groans, “They can wait for us.”
	He rarely sounds childish like that. Jamie happily looks at his handsome face, tilting her face glued to his. She says in a fake casual tone, “Ryan came to find me yesterday…”
	Dan slowly opens his eyes and asks coldly, “What does he want?”
	“Nothing but…” Jamie purposely ends at a cliffhanger to arouse his interest. She can’t hide her smirk until she feels the pain from Dan’s pinch on her waist.
	“Well?” Dan’s magnetic voice comes to her ear, then a hard bite is on her shoulder.
	What a jealous man! He has acted insane before she tells him anything.
	“He just cares about me. If you break my heart, he wants me to turn to him for help. He says he’ll wait for me forever and secretly grab me away.”
	“Nonsense!” Dan angrily whines, biting hard on Jamie’s cute earlobe.
	There’s zero possibility Jamie is stolen away from him as everyone in the world has known Jamie is his wife.
	How dare Ryan to tell it to her wife behind his back!
	“Ha! You believe it?’ Jamie tries to tamper her laugh in case he is exasperated to bite her ear off. “You’re fooled by me. Ryan wishes me happy, and he’ll never bother me as he is trying to let it go.”
	Jamie gets a bit sentimental as “let it go” is the most beautiful phrase she has heard from Ryan.
	She can’t hate Ryan who was her friend.
	Dan finally loosens his bite. “He’d better do it that way.”
	Jamie gets relaxed and lays her weight on Dan’s body, her head leaning against his shoulder, and there’s an inkling of love lurking in her eyes. “Dan, have I ever told you?”
	“What?” Dan replies gently.
	Jamie whispers into his ear and tells him three words, which brings surprise and joy to his blank face.
	Affection is building up in Dan’s eyes as he gazes at her.
	He tips her to face him and gently kisses her on her lips. He says in a seductive low voice, “I love you, too, babe. More than you do.”
	Breeze carries wafts of amora from the outside.
	A blissful lifetime shared with each other.
	I’ll love you, forever and always.
Chapter 433:Dramatic Friendship
	--Wendy
	In a warm and quiet room, there’s a girl sitting by a desk and sleeping with her head on it. From time to time, she groans as she’s having nightmares.
	“Bang!”
	When the clock strikes twelve, she flips her body and falls down onto the ground.
	“Ouch…” Wendy gets hurt and wakes up. When she tries to think of her nightmares, only to find…
	Nothing.
	She struggles to stand up. She lets it go as she’s not obsessed with her dreams. After patting away the dirt on her clothes, she sits back on her chair and writes the last sentence on a piece of note-paper full of words.
	“He’s the secret buried the deepest in my heart.” Jamie lets loose her soft smile as she looks at the beautiful writing of the words on the paper, toying with the pen n her hand, a touch of happiness dancing in her eyes.
	Every time she thinks of the knife-scar he has for protecting her, Wendy feels her wounds on her shoulder is less painful.
	But she loves him secretly. She is afraid to speak out her feelings as he never gives her any hints.
	Wendy sighs and puts down her pen. She props her chin against his hand, lost in melancholy, after she jams the rolled note-paper into a glass jar.
	Suddenly, there’s a loud bang from the French sash in her room. She is startled and hastily turns around to find Eddie breaking into her room.
	“Damn it!” Wendy is shocked and instinctively locks her door up. She shoots Eddie with a glare. “You’re such a stuntman for Spider-Man.”
	Eddie puts on his smug face and nods. “You should feel honored that I come to see you. Feeling better?”
	Wendy ignores it. She pulls out her chair in front of Eddie and seats herself on it. “What takes you so long? I’ve been waiting for you like an age. Plus, you don’t bring me any gift. Tut-tut.”
	Although Wendy is not satisfied with Eddie, she doesn’t kick him out of her room.
	After all, the dramatic friendship between her and Eddie is meant to be a mess. In their first chance encounter, she tripped over and pulled down Eddie’s pants. Then Eddie chased her down across several blocks. In the second one, she battered him away as she thought he came to retaliate. In the third one…
	Anyway, ever since then, they have been best friends. Wendy has been accustomed to seeing Eddie enter her room through the French sash.
	He hasn’t come to visit her for a month since the accident. He left her alone in hospital for half a month.
	Son of a bitch.
	“Just some business to deal with. Now I’m finally available.” Eddie’s eyes are dodging and he hides the truth. He takes out a gift box from his pocket and gives it to her.
	“That’s sweet, bro.” Wendy doesn’t notice the fleeting sorrow in Eddie’s eyes and takes the box. “I want to open it now.”
	She opens it up after Eddie nods.
	There’s a delicate cartoon figure of mini Wendy. Both the facial expression and the posture are similar to her.
	“Wow, is it…for me?” Wendy asks with surprise, her eyes glittering with joy. It seems she’s pleased with the gift.
	Eddie sighs in relief and stares at Wendy’s pretty face. The pain in his fingers is eased as he meets her smiling face.
	“It’s you. Do you like it?”
	Suddenly, she feels her heart is touched and something ripples out of it before she can suppress.
	“Yes, so much. Thank you, little Eddie.” A bright smile fills her face, her eyes narrowing on Eddie’s handsome face.
	Eddie’s features instantly darken, and he pinches her cheek hard as word bites out of his lips. “Say it again?”
	“Crap!” Wendy is shocked by his sudden pinch and pats on his hands off her cheek. “What the heck are you doing? Don’t you like ‘little Eddie?” I call you that as we are intimate.”
	Eddie is dumbfounded as he hears “intimate”, which gets him flush for a second before Wendy notices.
	But his eyes turn cold at the thoughts of Wendy’s crush on Duke.
	Eddie always thinks that he and Wendy are meant to be together. He can never imagine that Wendy actually loves Duke.
	But he respects her choice. What happened has happened, and he’ll never push her on edge to give him a chance.
	“By the way, why do you come here in the midnight?” Wendy was sleeping too soundly to notice the time. She is shocked that it’s as late as twelve now.
	Eddie twisted his lips hard and stands up. When Wendy is confused about what he’s going to do, he bends over and kisses Wendy on her lips. Then a carefree smirk curves his lips. “Wendy, take care of yourself. Remember not to stick your neck out for others impetuously, otherwise you’ll get hurt.”
	“Also, I know you have a solid stomach, but I hope you can eat less ice-cream at breakfast. Please eat more vegetables even if you hate them.”
	“Don’t go to the wasted land behind our school where you got your ankles sprained.”
	“And…”
	Eddie rattles off everything he can think of, which gets Wendy dizzy, and she nods at his words numbly.
	Finally, Eddie sighs shallowly, “I’m so worried that you fail to take good care of yourself without me.”
	“You…” Wendy looks at him confusedly and holds out her hand to touch his forehead. “Do you have a fever? What are you talking about?”
	But Wendy does remember Eddie’s last sentence and says, “If you worry about me, just come to look after me anytime you like.”
	Wendy is just a naive sophomore, having zero romance experience, in high school. Reckless as she is, she is so panicked that she hides away her crush on Duke after she realizes she loves him.
	She just gives her first kiss to Eddie, but she thinks it’s a goodnight kiss.
	Eddie looks at her and the word “okay” almost slips out of his tongue. Only God knows how much he’s dying to take good care of her forever, but he’s sane enough to see the purity in her eyes, which means everything but love. After all, she only regards him as her best friend.
	Sometimes, Eddie really hates to be her best friend as all he wants to be is her boyfriend.
Chapter 434:Adolescent Years Are Full Of His Name
	“Oh!” his sigh seems a bit tired, then he looks at Wendy deeply and straightens up with walking outside, “I have to go now, you should go to bed right now if you do not want to be late for the first class of that old lady tomorrow morning.”
	Before he steps out of the door, he turned his head back and sees her again with a reluctant to leave in heart, "Good night!
	"Good night!” Wendy feels there seems something wrong with Eddie Charlies today, but she can’t tell herself very clearly what's going on with Eddie, after hearing his “Good night”, Wendy doesn’t think too much, she starts to wash and then goes to her warm bed.
	But Eddie stands in front her house to midnight, when he sees the lights in Wendy's house goes out. Eddie begins to walk away slowly.
	When Wendy waits for Eddie to pick up her after picking up things and breakfast as he told, she finds that Eddie has broken his words.
	Wendy keeps waiting for Eddie at the door though it has been long past the time for class now, the housekeeper who is on his way back from the supermarket feels very strange when he sees Wendy doesn’t go to school, and Wendy answered nothing when the housekeeper asks her why, she just stands there.
	She dares not to go away because she is afraid that Eddie will appear the moment she leaves
	After 2 hours, her parents struggle to pull her into the house, and ask a leave from her teachers, her parents think she is ill today and ask her to have a rest upstairs.
	But Wendy stops suddenly, she says loudly, “I will go to school”, then she rushes out of the house.
	“Maybe a driver should send her to school,” Wendy’s mother says with disappointment.
	Wendy can’t care so much, but on her half way to school, she stops a taxi and tells the driver to go to Eddie’s home.
	Eddie’s house is very quiet with door closed. It seems that there is nobody lives here. Wendy rings the door bell after taking a deep breath.
	“Hello! This is Eddie’s home! ” the housekeeper Amy says very politely with his face appearing on the dialogue screen in the door.
	“Hello, Amy, this is Wendy, may I speak to Eddie? I have been waiting for him for a very long time today. He promised to me that he will pick me up, but he breaks his words. Has he gone to school now?”
	It’s too disappointing if it is true.
	Wendy feels more uneasy, it seems that she will be submerged in this feeling.
	“Well….” Amy suddenly becomes speechless, after a while she slowly says to Wendy, “Miss Wendy...Eddie has…”
	Wendy is very nervous and waits so anxiously for Amy’s words.
	“Eddie has been abroad now. He takes planes at 6.00 this morning.”
	Amy’s words is just like a thunder , which shocked Wendy heavily, and then Wendy get so angry that there seems a volcano is going to erupt in her heart.
	“Has he been abroad now?” Wendy struggles to say these 5 words with hands seizing her school bag tightly.
	“Yeah…” Amy seems to be afraid of seeing Wendy’s angry eyes, because Eddie has told her not to say something to Wendy, “Miss Wendy, I have something to do, so I have to go now, bye!”
	The screen become dark the moment Amy says bye to Wendy, Wendy’s pale but smile face becomes very dull and disappointed before the dark screen.
	Wendy is so sad, if someone wants to describe her sadness, he just needs imagine how a man will feel when he is going to drowned himself.
	Wendy treats Eddie as a very good friend, but he leaves without any notice at this moment, Wendy is wondering whether Eddie has regarded her as a true friend.
	“Shit! Eddie, I am really foolish, I shouldn’t have treated you as my good friend” Wendy becomes so angry that she turned around quickly and kicks the door heavily.
	Wendy tells herself that she should just forget about this guy.
	She has thought of the words he said before, Eddie once told Wendy to take good care of herself and they can be friends forever, but now these words seems all like bullshit.
	“Eddie is an absolutely liar!” Wendy tells herself again.
	Wendy has always cherished the friendship very much, if not so, she would not be so brave to fight a bad guy who wanted to kill Duke Field.
	Wendy goes back to home very heavily with her head down, but she doesn’t know that someone has been standing in the balcony of third floor in Eddie’s house, and staring her for a very long time.
	---
	Time flies so fast, five years is not a very long time, but also is not a very short time. To Wendy, the five year becomes so deep day by days and can’t be forgotten by her in the mood that Wendy has a crush on Duke Field.
	Wendy is the only daughter of her family, and she will inherit the family property later, so her parents took her into the company immediately the moment she graduated from university so that Wendy can get familiar with the company affairs as soon as possible.
	Today is a very special day due to Duke Field.
	There is a name that has occupied Wendy’s whole adolescent years.
	The name is Duke Field.
	It is just a simple two words, but just the two words can make Wendy’s heart beat faster.
	Wendy keeps going to the room 2601 of Xi Garden in every 20th day of every month, there is an open kitchen in that room, she will make people prepare food materials in advance and then she will enjoy her dinner in this room.
	Maybe it is very strange for other people
	But this is an only hope that has not been given up by Wendy, and Wendy has stick to this hope for 5 years although Wendy’s heart has become so tired because she has loved Duke deeply for 5 years!
	Duke’s mother passed away in 20th, so Duke comes to Xi Garden in 20th day of every month, he always drinks a lot of strong wine and becomes very drunk just in the next door of Wendy’s room.
	Bruce hill has told Wendy the things. Wendy decides to make some delicious home dishes for Duke when she gets up today.
	In fact, Wendy can not cook some nice food, her dishes are not so fantasy and dedicate. Her family has taught her almost everything but cooking.
	Even she can place this dinner in a five-star restaurant, but she decides to cook food on her own, just because she wants to cook for the boy that she loves so much.
	However, Duke Field throws away Wendy’s dishes the moment she takes them to Duke’s room, and tell Wendy to get out!
	But Wendy doesn’t give up, she wants to have another try and finally she is successful on her third attempt, When Wendy is waiting nervously in the room, a waiter walks to her and tells her that Duke has eaten that dishes.
	Wendy doesn’t find anything wrong with that word, and she has paid more effort to study how to cook, but unluckily she doesn’t have the gift of learning cooking, but she will be more hard-working in learning cooking as long as she heard that Duke has eaten her dishes.
	She loves the boy in her whole adolescent years.
	Now it has been 5 years, Wendy makes a decision under numerous tangles. She will express her love to Duke after 0.00.
	She lets the waiter send her dishes to Duke’s room as usual, then she begins to wait, after 20 minutes, the waiter comes to knock at her door.
	“What is gong on?” Wendy has been waited for a long time just beside the door, so she opens the door immediately the moment the waiter knocks at her door.
	But what she can see is an embarrassing face of the waiter, he almost can not say any words clearly and after a while he tells Wendy that Duke Field has eaten all her dishes
	“Okay…well” Wendy tries to pretend to be calm with her fists clenched, then she say,” Does he drink too much today? I’d like to see him.”
	The waiter is going to leave.
	But quickly the waiter stops her, “Miss Wendy, you can’t go there now”.
	“What’s going on?” Wendy is very confused.
	“Mr. Field has something important today, and he doesn’t want to be disturbed by anyone.” the waiter answers very fluently because Duke Field has told him to do so.
	Wendy has become more confused, what happened to him? As far as she knows, Duke will give up all the things no matter how important in the 20th day of every month.
Chapter435:Who Is He?
	Wendy stares at the waiter with lots of confusion for a very long time, and suddenly she feels a sense of relief, because she thinks, she has decided that what she has paid in the past 5 years can move the hard heart. Although Duke doesn’t know that, there will be a little hope as long as she tells him.
	Wendy walks to his room in her black lather shoes with his clip bitten.
	The waiter wants to stop her when he sees that, but it’s too late.
	But Wendy doesn’t want to give up. She raises her hands and begins to knock at the door. She suddenly sees Duke’s cold face is getting closer and closer to her.
	Duke Field frowns and asks Wendy very coldly, “Why are you here?”
	It is just 3 words, but it is the 3 words that discouraged Wendy heavily.
	Wendy doesn’t know how to answer, but she suddenly answers, “Sorry, I have just knocked at the wrong room. I am so sorry, I come here to have dinner with my friend, but…maybe l remembered the wrong room number, so…”
	For fear that Duke will doubt her. She tries to see his eyes with lots of sadness.
	To her relief, Duke doesn’t drink too much wine today. Not drinking too much is good.
	But Duke just gives only a glance to her, “Yeah…” with a very small voice, and there isn’t any emotion in his deep eyes. It seems there is nobody in front of him although Wendy just is here.
	The cold from Duke Field seems deeply root in his bone.
	Wendy’s heart has beaten more quickly, and she is so nervous that her hands produce lots of sweat when she is just looking at Duke.
	“Anything else?” asked by Duke, he looks at Wendy so confusedly.
	“Yeah…Nothing!” answered by Wendy, “Now I have to go and look for my friend.” Wendy is frightened by Duke and she walks out hesitantly.
	“Yeah…bye.” says by Duke without any hesitation, Duke seems doesn’t want her to stay here.
	Wendy becomes so sad!
	She feels Duke seems become much more far from herself. In other words, she thinks that Duke has never become so close to her like today.
	Wendy thinks maybe this is just a monologue of herself from the beginning to the end, because Duke has never known her. She can not blame for anyone. She thinks that maybe her own eyes have become blind.
	Wendy takes a long and deep breathes, and then she begins to walks forward with her bags.
	It takes a very long time for Wendy become so brave to express her love to Duke, but now, it takes seconds for her to become not brave any more.
	Wendy is so sad that she doesn’t find that there is someone following her at this moment, but that guy keeps a very well distance so that Wendy can not find her.
	When Wendy walks to the corner, there is a very hurry voice, “Hey, Lady, watch out! Be careful!”
	Wendy stops walking suddenly and see a dish car out of control is rushing to her.
	Wendy has not come back yet. She feels there is something danger getting closer and closer to her.
	It’s too late!
	Something dangerous has crushed on her!
	There is a harsh sound there with lots of cups and dishes falling to the ground.
	Wendy, however, suddenly find herself seems to fall in to a warm arms with nice smell, she doesn’t feel any pain.
	He comes again.
	It is him again!
	Wendy knows exactly it must be him although she still keeps her eyes closed.
	She imagined that man has helped him for a lot of times, although she doesn’t know exactly who he is, she can make sure this gut must be a man by his body smell.
	Wendy can hardly remember that it is in the senior high school graduating party that she was saved by that man for the first time.
	She thinks that she has lost her boyfriend, and drank too much, finally she went back home in a very drunk condition.
	Later, she was followed by someone. The bad guy forced her into an alley, but luckily, someone saved her.
	But unluckily, Wendy didn’t see the man who saved her clearly.
	Since then, the stranger has come into Wendy’s life, and this stranger always can save her in some extreme condition. What she can make sure is that she really doesn’t know the man, but she feels so strange to this stranger.
	If the stranger knows Wendy, why doesn’t he want to show his own face?
	If the stranger doesn’t know Wendy, why is he so kind to Wendy?
	Wendy feels dizzy. Suddenly she wants to work out who the man is.
	She seizes his clothes so tightly.
	“Miss, are you OK?” asked the man with a feeling that his clothes are pulled out by someone, then, Wendy begins to open her eyes and look up slowly.
	What she has seen is an absolutely face that she has never seen before.
	“Is it you that saved me?” Wendy’s brain has come back from a big mess. She still seizes the man’s clothes. She begins to sit and asks that man.
	The strangers smiles then shakes his head, ” No, not me, it is a very handsome sir that saved you, his arm gets wounded while saving you, and now he has been away just now!”
	Wendy has a bit disappointment when she heard it is not this man that save her, but she asks, “Where does he go?”
	The man points at a direction, and then Wendy stands up immediately regardless of her wound, she rushes out to that direction.
	But she has never seen that man, how can she recognize that man?
	And…
	That man seems doesn’t want Wendy to know him.
	Wendy is thinking, and her steps get slower, but she doesn’t stop, she feels a lot of disappointed.
	This feeling of disappointment now has fully submerged the exciting feeling of successfully expressing her love to Duke.
	She herself hasn’t found it.
	Who is he?
	Wendy gets back to the gate of the hotel with lots of disappointing feelings and she sips her clips tightly.
	--
	There is a seat in the 7th floor, of which the atmosphere here is very quiet.
	Liam doesn’t stop Duke’s action, and he just sits here before Duke Field.
	“You are as same as before although I haven’t seen you for such a long time!” says by Duke Field slightly, but a person who knows Duke can feel his words is full of love and disappointment.
	Liam smiles with a bit shy, and she keeps her lips bitten tightly, she looks at Duke nervously, she thinks, if it is not Wendy, how could she have met Duke at this present?
	“Duke, are you still blaming me?” asked by her cautiously with some tears in her eyes.
	Duke’s smile stops for some seconds, and then he looks at her deeply.
	“I am so sorry to reject you then, but I am not on purpose absolutely…”with two rows of tears sliding down from his big eyes, “My parents wanted me to have further education so that I can run their company better, I am the only daughter of my family, I can’t disappoint them .”
	“I am so sorry to you, but I really can’t disappoint them, it doesn’t matter if you can’t understand me, however, in this planet only my parents are the people who loves me best, if I have another chance to choose parents, I will still choose them as my parents.” says by Liam movingly with full sincere, and she stares at Duke’s eyes straightly.
	Duke trembles slightly, he loves the girl deeply for whole 5years, how could he have the heart to blame the girl?
	He takes a handkerchief from the table, and passes it to the girl, “Don’t cry, I won’t blame you because it’s good not to disappoint your parents.”
	Not only Duke doesn’t blame her, but also he doesn’t feel angry any more due to her sudden decision of getting further education at that time.
	He values the affection among relatives a lot, so in the 20thday of every month, he will go to memory his mother.
	Duke begins to think that Liam is the right girl for him by her words.
Chapter 436:Why Are You So Sad
	Joey's sobbing gradually faded. And finally she fell into Duke's arms, wrapped her arms around his neck, and looked at Duke affectionately, "Duke, I really like you. I have never stopped thinking about you for five years. Never stopped. Do you still like me?"
	As long as he is a normal man, he will be moved when seeing his beloved woman looking at him like this.
	Duke lowered his head slightly, and kissed Joey's lips, using his actions to prove it.
	Fortunately, they are sitting in a courting chair, and the position is relatively off. No matter what they do, no one will think it is strange.
	But every time Duke kissed Joey, his heart would beat violently, heavily, suffocatingly, making him feel like he was doing something wrong.
	Joey was very active today, even more active than she was five years ago, and immediately erased the guilt in Duke's heart and made him fascinated by the passionate kiss.
	Only then did Duke thoroughly realize that even though his heart and eyes were blinded, his body had not forgotten the girl who saved him.
	——
	Since then, Wendy hasn't seen Duke for half a month. As always, she could only see Duke on the 20th of every month. Even Bruce, who was often with him, had no idea about where Duke was.
	Wendy had no intention to work and sent a text message to Jamie who had recently returned to China and brought Bunny back. Wendy felt happy when she thought of that cute kid.
	She likes cute people or things. No one will dislike a kid as cute as Bunny.
	Rubbing her eyes, Wendy stretched tiredly.
	Having glanced at the time, she found that it was six o'clock, so after a while she left the company.
	The company was still in the hands of her father, so Wendy's job was relatively easy. It took her five years to climb from the grassroots to the position of general manager. The employees in the company are convinced of her.
	Wendy's career has always been smooth, without much setbacks.
	If there is any setback, it is not about work, but about love.
	She was going to a dinner that night. Her father has just handed her the cooperation proposal with Lan's Enterprise. She went there to negotiate the cooperation with Lan's Enterprise.
	In fact, it was enough to send an assistant or secretary to negotiate, because the cooperation with Lan's enterprise was not important, but after maintaining such a long cooperative relationship, they still had to give Lan's enterprise some respect.
	At about seven o'clock, Wendy arrived at the Star Hotel, told the waiter in the lobby who was invited, and followed the waiter into the elevator.
	Actually Wendy didn't like the Lan family at all, but she knew that there is a clear distinction between business and privateness.
	"Hello, Mr Lan." Wendy was polite and thoughtful, with a smile on her face.
	"Isn't this Wendy? You have grown up." James Lan was surprised for a moment, stretched out his hand and shook hands with Wendy with a smile on his face, and then arranged seats for everyone.
	Although James hadn't seen Wendy for a long time, he always heard her father mention her and her impressive professional experience.
	In just five years, by virtue of her own ability, from a low-level employee to general manager, her ability should not be underestimated.
	They talked about cooperation first. At the beginning, James wanted to take advantage of Wendy's young age and her lack of experience to suppress her. As a result, Wendy was not fooled at all and handled it very well.
	Finally, they signed the contract before letting the waiter serve the food.
	Wendy glanced at her watch and found that the conversation has lasted for an hour. Fortunately, she had already called her home tonight so that the family wouldn't have to wait for her to eat.
	After dinner, Wendy said goodbye to James and left the Star Hotel.
	She drove from the underground garage of the Star Hotel, but Wendy stopped the car involuntarily as she passed the commercial street.
	A man and a woman are standing on the opposite road. The man is carrying a few brand-name bags in one hand and a sweet and gentle-looking woman in the other. Walking on the street, neither of them speaks, but their sweetness and happiness can be seen between their eyes.
	The sight pierced Wendy's eyes deeply.
	With her hands on the steering wheel tightening violently, Wendy blinked vigorously when she saw this loving couple in the distance.
	Did she not know that Duke liked Joey, or that the person Duke had been waiting for was Joey, or that Duke's favorite bride candidate was only Joey?
	But why is she still so sad when she knows everything?
	Quietly watching Duke and Joey walk away, after a long time, Wendy blinked her dry eyes and drove away from here, as if nothing had happened.
	In fact, Wendy always knew that no matter who Duke liked or was with, it didn't matter to her, because she just had a secret love for Duke.
	...
	Wendy's secret love was very restrained and calm. She only told Joey, so only Joey knew.
	In other words, if she doesn't say it herself, no one can tell.
	Since knowing that Joey came back, Wendy has rarely appeared in front of Duke again. Even the Garden, which she must go to on the 20th of every month, has never been visited again.
	It was not that she didn't want to get close to Duke, she wanted to see him, even at a glance, but after all, she was not the person he liked. If she told the secret, their friendship would be broken.
	But things went against everyone's wish.
	Jamie was injured when shooting Moon's perfume advertisement. Wendy hurriedly ran to the hospital to visit him. It was lunch time when she got downstairs to the hospital, so she packed a meal and took it up. .
	By coincidence, she ran into Duke who came to the hospital with Joey.
	After a few words of greeting, Wendy left here under the pretext of going to the bathroom. Unfortunately, Joey also followed.
	"It's been so long, Wendy, didn't you miss me?" The smile on Joey's face was as sweet as ever, but inexplicably, there was a touch of sullenness in those delicate and willful eyes.
	Wendy couldn't tell people exactly, but she also had her own intuition and could vaguely feel Joey's change.
	Joey's strong sense of worldliness was no longer like the delicate lady Wendy had known before.
	"Sorry, we don't seem to be acquaintances." Wendy gave her a cold look, then reached under the automatic sensor faucet and took a handful of water to wash her hands.
	The smile on Joey's face froze, a trace of resentment flashed in her eyes, and then she looked at Wendy and said sarcastically, "Did you see me and Duke come here and follow us shamelessly?"
	"You have a good imagination." Wendy's mouth twitched, and she marveled at Joey's imagination.
	If she knew she would meet them here, she would definitely take a detour.
	Joey snorted, folding her hands around her chest and looking at Wendy in a gesture of declaring her sovereignty. "Don't you think I don't know your thoughts? Do you dare to say that you have no feelings for Duke?"
	"So what? Do you dare to tell him?" Wendy shook the water from her hand, treating Joey as an idiot.
	Wendy was always like this, and it was obvious that Joey knew that she liked Duke and would deliberately use this to make her unhappy.
Chapter 437:Can You Let It Go?
	But Wendy didn't care that much. Joey hadn't told Duke for so long, which meant she was worried.
	Joey was indeed worried. She knew exactly why Duke liked her. If it was no longer a secret that Wendy liked him, then Wendy would definitely not hold back like it was then. Wendy would take the opportunity to get close to Duke...
	What she did at the beginning will be exposed.
	Thinking of this, Joey's eyes grew more resentful. It should be she, not Wendy, who rescued Duke. Why did Wendy come to disrupt it?
	"Do you treat me as a fool? You want me to give you a chance to get close to Duke? Dream! Duke has promised me that he will marry me!" Joey said this proudly, then turned around and left here.
	Marry?
	Marry.
	Wendy took a deep breath, feeling a little aggrieved. She had never thought about marrying Duke, but when she heard the news that he was getting married, the pain in her heart could not be concealed.
	That was the man he loved so much for a whole youth.
	Wendy, waited until he and Joey got married, would you just let it go?
	Wendy told herself that. She suddenly thought of the man who would always show up to help her when she encountered difficulties, and wanted to know who he was.
	In the next few days, Wendy ran back and forth between her home, company and hospital.
	Until one day, when Wendy had just arrived at the company, she heard her assistant tell her that a new member of the secretarial department had been sent in by Lan's enterprise under the assent of Wendy's father.
	Wendy raised her eyebrows. She didn't quite understand what her father meant. Their company had no precedent for such a case.
	What if she was a commercial spy? Wasn't her father worried?
	"Your father did hesitate, but Lan made a 3% profit on the case we are cooperating recently before he agreed." The assistant said.
	Wendy gulped in amazement, even more confused about what her father was thinking.
	Her father was not the kind of person who would be bought by money, was it...
	Thinking of this, the door was suddenly opened, shocking Wendy who was thinking about it.
	"Wendy, starting from today, we are working for one company. I hope you will take good care of me." Joey walked in, with a sweet smile on her face, looking at Wendy innocently.
	If others didn't know Joey, they would be confused by Joey's behavior.
	But Wendy was different. She used to be a close friend to Joey. No one knew who she was better than her.
	Looking at her like this, Wendy only found it ridiculous, as if nothing happened yesterday.
	Wendy raised her eyebrows slightly, suppressing the thought on her face, and looked at Joey sharply, "What are you doing in here?"
	"I just returned home, knowing that you are in this company, and I am very excited. I want to come and see you. Am I not welcome?" Joey looked at Wendy innocently, a little anxiously, "I'm sorry if I interrupt you…"
	"Ms. Lan, this is the general manager's office. Please don't talk nonsense." The assistant couldn't stand it anymore. Those who did this job were smart people, and the people who followed Wendy were the smartest. Seeing Joey like this, she could see something was wrong.
	This woman obviously didn't like their general manager and pretended to be extremely happy. Was this necessary?
	"I didn't mean that, Wendy, you are the general manager. Are you no longer friends with me?" Joey's eyes flushed and she looked at Wendy pitifully, as if Wendy had bullied her.
	The door of the office was open, and the secretarial staff couldn't help listening to the sound inside.
	If these words were spread, Wendy would inevitably be said to be a person who loved the poor and loved the rich. Moreover, she is the boss's daughter, and her every move represents the entire company. The spread of these rumors would not be good for her or the company.
	The assistant was provoked, this was clearly a provocation!
	This Joey...
	Wendy squinted his eyes, then looked at Joey sharply, and said slowly, "You did something wrong, what does it have to do with us as friends?"
	Joey was surprised, and was interrupted by Wendy when she was about to speak, "When you enter the company, you are an employee of the company. Didn't anyone tell you to knock on the door before you come in? As the general manager, there must be a lot of commercial secrets in the office. You just rushed in. If you find something you shouldn't look at, could it be said... you did it on purpose? "
	Joey, who was stuck in Wendy's words, didn't know what to say for a while. Her face was red and then blue and finally black and dark, as colorful as a palette.
	The secretaries outside who had some disagreements suddenly realized that the general manager's office could not be entered by anyone. And this person still rushed in without knocking on the door. If she sees any trade secrets, then...
	For a while, the secretaries outside the door wanted to understand the twists and turns, and they had some bad opinions about Joey.
	Joey's face grew gloomy, but she knew that someone was watching outside, and she was just an ordinary secretary, but Wendy was the general manager, could she still dare to oppose her?
	However, Wendy would pay the price sooner or later!
	Thinking about it, Joey calmed down, her eyes were still pitiful, she bit her lip and said, "Okay, I know, I won't do this again in the future."
	"That's good, you can go out." Wendy said in a cold voice. Fortunately, she locked the computer screen before Joey came in. Otherwise, if she really saw something, who knew what she would do?
	All in all, Wendy subconsciously felt that Joey's appearance was not accidental.
	Joey reluctantly left the general manager's office. The moment the door opened, all the eavesdroppers in front of the door dispersed immediately, and they went away as if they hadn't seen Joey.
	Joey was a new secretary. Every company has more or less suppressing newcomers. In addition to the performance in Wendy's office today, everyone thought Joey was unkind, so they let her do some chores.
	Joey wanted to use her identity to suppress them, but she held back because she thought of what her father said to her before entering the company.
	Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. Sooner or later these people would kneel down and beg her!
	Wendy was not idle either. She wanted to go up to the president's office and ask her father why he put Joey in, but because she was too busy, she didn't go there.
Chapter 438:The Back was Familiar.
	Wendy felt very tired this day. Her company was developing a new project these days, all the staff was very busy. She also needed to work overtime tonight which made Wendy want to beg for comfort.
	Finally, it was the time to go off work. Wendy turned off the computer, set a few layers of password, and then locked the important documents into the safe. the outside of the safe was fingerprint lock, inside was the password lock. Therefore, it would not be so easy to open. And her office door was also special, she only opened it at the worktime.
	It showed how important this project was, there must be no accident.
	Wendy left the office with her bag and went off work after telling the secretaries.
	Joey Lan was tired after being accused of doing many things the whole day. She had never done these chores before. Her hands were meant to play the piano. Why she had to buy coffee, lunch or print papers for these inferior men?
	Joey was very angry when she thought about it. She saw everyone leave but none of them greeted to her. And then when she looked at the general manager's door, the mobile phone vibrated.
	Joey took back her gazes and found it was a message from Duke Field. It said that he was already waiting for her downstairs to pick her up home.
	Joey stopped complaining and picked up her bag and ran outside. Soon she was downstairs and saw Duke leaning next to a silver Rolls-Royce.
	“Duke" Joey rushed to Duke like a butterfly and was not as angry as she had been. Maybe she saw that Wendy come out from the other side of the exit down, she deliberately kissed Duke on his face.
	Duke did not care, but reached out naturally to take her bag, "How about the first day at work? Is it hard? "
	Wendy who came over and heard Duke's words, she thought, “If you think the work is too hard, why don’t you keep her at home instead of sending her to work?”
	As Wendy was about to go to the other side of her car, Joey suddenly said, "of course not, because there is Wendy to take care of me. What I am afraid of as Wendy is here?"
	Joey was intentional because she knew that if she said it at this time, Duke would let Wendy take care of her. Then Wendy wouldn't embarrass her for the sake of Duke, even if she didn't want to take care of her.
	Wendy took a slight step, then turned sideways to look at Joey, and saw a smile of relief on her face.
	"Wendy, I thank you first. It’s Joey’s first time to work, please forgive her if she does something wrong." Duke’s words were considerate and all for Joey.
	But Wendy felt anxious, not for Duke’s words but for Joey’s proud expression.
	"It doesn't matter, as long as she keeps her part and does what she should do." Wendy said perfunctorily, looking at Duke indifferently. Although Duke was so wise, but he still didn’t know what Wendy thought through her eyes.
	Secret love was different from like, which doomed to not be known. Every person who knew secret love, would certainly disguise themselves.
	And Wendy, after all these years of disguising, she could hide her like easily if she didn’t want Duke to know it.
	Even Joey was surprised, didn’t Wendy like Duke, or how would she refuse his request?
	Just as Joey and Duke were thinking, Wendy had left, got into her car, and went away.
	Joey bit her lips, thinking of what Wendy said in the restaurant that day, she felt upset. How could Wendy give up the man she had tried her best to have so easily?
	“Let's go.” Duke frowned. The memory of being stabbed and then rescued by Joey appeared in his mind for no reason, but the figure who blocked the knife for him was a little blurred.
	Wendy’s back was very familiar.
	“Duke, thank you for taking me home." Joey saw Duke staring at Winnie's back dazed, she felt a little panicked, hurriedly hugged his arm.
	“Silly girl.” Duke's mind was drawn back by her, did not think again, fastened Joey's seat belt, and then started the car to leave here.
	For the next few days, Joey was more obedient, and did not clearly go against Wendy. She was probably afraid of the chores that commended by the secretaries, becoming well-behaved and did what the secretaries asked. Therefore, those in the secretarial department didn’t go too far with her.
	Listening to the assistant report the news, Wendy nodded to signal that she got it. Then she yawned, unlocked the computer to open the page, that was the page of the project which belonged to the top secret.
	It took a long time for Wendy to divert her eyes from the computer. She pressed around her eyes to relieve her eye fatigue, and then took off the radiation-proof glasses she was wearing.
	At the end of this project, she would have a good rest. If it was not for Dan William who hated to part with Jamie, she really wanted to go around the world with her!
	She just thought about it for a while, after all, there's such a bomb here.
	Wendy rubbed her eyes, then turned the page off, tapped her finger on the keyboard a few times, and then moved another page to the table. After that she got up and walked to the bathroom that in the office.
	"Wendy, the cooperation case with Lan’s was suddenly interrupted, and the president asked you to come over and have a look." As soon as Wendy came out of the bathroom, she saw the assistant rush in and said to her.
	"What's going on?" How did it suddenly break?”
	"The land was first demolished in protest, and in the end, we went under pressure to develop it, causing a lot of residents' dissatisfaction, so ..."
	Wendy nodded and packed her things into her bag, “Well, I’m going to have a look.”
	"I'll go with you." The assistant was not reassured, after all, Wendy was a woman, and those residents would not be polite in the case of their own interested damaged.
	Wendy didn't object and left with her assistant.
	Wendy and the assistant still did not come back at noon. It was the time for lunch, the workers of secretarial department left the office to eat. However, Joey was lying on the table without moving. These days she had a good relationship with the colleagues, so a few people came to ask her if she was sick.
	Joey looked a little pale and shook her head, "You go to lunch, I'm just in my period and a little uncomfortable, just bring me a bag of tampons."
	"Well, let's go first and bring you food back."
	Joey nodded weakly, lying on the table, and finally waited to hear the sound of the door. After that she sat up, ran to the door to make sure that there was no one outside the door
	.
Chapter 439:Only Known by oneself
	There was a monitoring in secretary's department, but as Joey was premeditated, and naturally interfered with the monitoring.
	She went to the general manager's door and tried to open it.
	This door was not easy to open, it was locked by the password, Joey couldn’t get in.
	Finally, she suddenly thought of a few numbers, and then input them, and the door opened.
	Anger and pleasure flashed in her eyes. Wendy actually used Duke’s birthday to do the password, it seemed that she still kept him in her mind. Fortunately, she knew Wendy liked Duke, otherwise she couldn’t open the door.
	After all, Wendy was rarely absent from the company.
	Opened the door, Joey crept in, began to look around, and finally focused on the computer.
	But the computer also had passwords, and there were two!
	"Slut!" Joey couldn’t help cursing. When looking at the tricky question in the computer, she was champing with rage.
	Because the question on the computer was, “There's a little bitch in the world, what's her name?”
	Joey input of several answers, and they were wrong. There were only two opportunities left, she couldn’t make mistake any more.
	Therefore, she held back the thought of strangling Wendy, tapping a few words with her trembling fingers on the keyboard.
	The answer was correct.
	"Wendy!" Joey was extremely angry. “Did Wendy hate her so much that the answer was her name?”
	That's right, the answer was Joey's name, and Joey typed it meant that she acknowledged that which made her rage.
	But when Joey thought things were so easy to get done, there was a question showing in the screen again!
	That was, “The sum of Duke's and Joey's birthdays.”
	Joey hurriedly took out the mobile phone to calculate, and the answer turned out to be 438!
	Wendy!
	Joey was angry and trembling.
	Fortunately, there were only two locks in the computer. Moreover, the project was still on the table and had not been shut down.
	Well, as there were so many locks and questions, even if not closed, no one can steal it.
	It's just a pity that Joey knew Wendy very well.
	Joey linked her mobile phone with the computer, and then copied the program to the mobile phone, while looking to the door. As soon as the file was copied, she immediately unplugged the phone, wiped off the desktop and computer traces, and then left Wendy's office.
	Less than a minute after she left, the monitors in Wendy's office and the outside secretary began to run again.
	Wendy didn't know her files had been stolen, and after she had solved case with Lan’s, she went back to her apartment.
	——
	All the secret loves were destined to be known only by oneself.
	After last time they met, Wendy always went downstairs before Joey every time and drove off.
	She knew she was running away, but she couldn’t stand watching Duke and Joey showing affection and blessing them.
	Wendy left the building as usual, and when was about to walk past Duke's car to hers, she was suddenly stopped by Duke.
	"Wendy, wait." Duke took a look at Wendy and frowned, so he dropped the car window and stopped her.
	Wendy stunned, then turned around as if she was calm, "Duke, are you going to pick up Joey, she's still up there, maybe a little later."
	"No, I mean, your back..." Sue looked a little embarrassed and wanted to stop.
	“My back?”
	Wendy looked at her back in doubt, but saw nothing, so she turned to assess herself with Duke’s car, and her little face turned red.
	She was wearing a black and white professional dress, a small black suit with white pencil pants made her like a fashionista.
	But because it was white, the red blood was obvious...
	"Cover it up first." Somehow, seeing Wendy’s red little face, Duke was softhearted.
	He had always been reluctant to take care of others’ matter, but now he had taken off his coat subconsciously.
	Wendy took it with a red face, and the suit was still warm, warmed all over her limbs.
	But she suddenly remembered that she did not prepare a tampon in her bag, because her menstruation has never been right, so she put tampons in the apartment and office. But how could she go up like...
	"What's wrong?" Duke asked a faint voice when he saw her look depressed and tongue-tied.
	"No, it's all right..." Wendy knew Duke wouldn't help her buy tampons, and she didn’t want to make him embarrassed.
	"Duke!" Joey's voice suddenly sounded, hurriedly, as if she was afraid of being snatched of something.
	As soon as she walked in, she called out her tongue, "I'm sorry, I'm late, you must have waited for a long time."
	"It's okay, I've only been here for a short time." Duke smiled softly.
	Wendy thought, “well, a short time, he's really considerate.”
	Wendy smiled sarcastically hurting. It really hurt a lot when comparing to others.
	At that point, Joey saw Wendy waist surrounded by a suit, very large, obviously it belonged to a man.
	Turned around to see Duke, and sure enough, there's only one shirt.
	"Duke, I'm not feeling well. Let's go back." Joey went to the co-pilot's seat over there and sat down, urging him.
	"Okay." Duke nodded slightly, then politely said to Wendy, "Goodbye
	“Goodbye." Wendy smiled, waved to him, and watched as the car grew farther and farther away before she got into her car.
	"Duke, you just seemed to be having a good time, what did you talked about?"
	Joey's tone was full of jealous.
	Duke didn't understand what she meant, thinking she was just asking, and said, "Nothing, just borrow her clothes to cover up the embarrassment."
	"Well, Okay." Joey was not willing to hear such an answer.
	It's too dangerous to let them get along like this!
	It was time for her to do something.
	Wendy drove back to her apartment and bought a few packets of her regular tampons at the supermarket before returning home.
	After she changed her tampon, she washed Duke's suit. Duke wouldn’t ask for the suit that stained with her blood but, and of course, she couldn't bear to throw it away.
	“What she can do?” she finally made her mind to give up, but now, she was not reconciled.
	——
	But then something happened later made Wendy face up to the fact that she must give up him.
	Joey suddenly sent Wendy a text message, said there was something to discuss with her, asked her to meet her.
	Wendy didn’t want to go first, but she still met Joey with curiosity after thinking.
	If she could know the result, she wouldn't go.
Chapter 440:Duke Field, You are a Bastard.
	In the Blue Bar, Joey Lan deliberately chooses a secluded seat. When she sees Wendy coming, she beckons to Wendy.
	Wendy walks over. She sits down frowningly after she sees the two wine bottles on the table.
	"Why ask me out?" Wendy puts her handbag aside, but she does not stop Joey from drinking. She just looks at Joey quietly.
	Joey pushes both bottles of wine in front of Wendy, then puts the juice in front of herself. She says to Wendy, "You know I can't drink."
	"Then why do you still invite me here?" Wendy looks at her sarcastically.
	"I thought you wanted to come here." Joey looks innocent.
	"I just want to tell you that Duke likes me. Don't pester him anymore."
	Wendy can't help rolling her eyes. Since she meets Joey, Joey always says it to her
	She doesn't seem to pester Duke deliberately, does she?
	"I think you’re wrong. I know he likes you, but what does this have to do with me?" Wendy says lightly, ignoring Joey's resentful and pleading gaze completely.
	"Since you know, why do you always pester him?" Joey is a little anxious, trying to grab Wendy's hands, but Wendy avoids her.
	Wendy frowns. "When did I pester him?"
	"When?! Since I came back, you always pester him. Last time he borrowed your suit. If you didn't say anything to him, why has he been so indifferent to me recently?" Joey looks at Wendy resentfully. She puts all the responsibility on Wendy.
	In fact, Duke has been busy recently so he doesn't have much time to take care of Joey. Who will have thought that it will cause such a misunderstanding?
	"You are overthinking. I have to go." Wendy stands up and is about to leave with her handbag.
	Joey sees that Wendy is going to leave. She grabs Wendy’s hand, "No, you can't go. You must give me an explanation today!"
	Wendy becomes a little impatient. She wants to leave, but Joey stops her.
	"Joey, let me go!" Wendy pulls open her finger frowningly, but Joey holds her hands tightly.
	"Hey, these two girls look pretty good." An obscene voice sounds, making people scared.
	Wendy turns her head to look. She sees a group of hooligans approaching them. Their obscene gazes fix on Wendy and Joey.
	…
	When Duke Field arrives, he saw Joey being forced to drink alcohol. He becomes extremely angry. He rushes to Joey's side, ignoring Wendy.
	Wendy looks at his back. She quietly watches him hit those people to the ground. His actions are fierce.
	Then, he holds back his hostility and rage, walks to Joey, gently picks her up, and kisses her injured forehead.
	Wendy has never seen Duke be so bloodthirsty and fierce, or be gentle and caring.
	All his tenderness and exceptions belong to the woman in his arms.
	Maybe it’s because of the alcohol, Wendy suddenly remembers a memory long time ago.
	In October of that year, she fell in love at first sight.
	Wendy is confused for the first time. What she likes is Duke who guarded her back then, or the crush that she is insisting on but will never have a result?
	She only feels that the scene in front of her is getting more and more hazy. Her mind is still in a mess. In the end, she falls down.
	Before she faints, she sees Duke holding Joey and walking away from her.
	“Goodbye, my secret love.”
	“Goodbye, Duke who made me fell in love with you at first sight.”
	Wendy said to herself. Then she falls down.
	"Miss, are you okay?"
	Who is it?
	Whose voice is so familiar?
	But Wendy can’t think about it. She falls into a coma.
	Eddie Charlies looks at the looming little face in the black hair. He is a little surprised. Is it Wendy? He has never expected to meet Wendy in such a place. He is extremely surprised.
	Then, he doesn't hesitate anymore. He picks up Wendy, walks out, gets in his car, and then drives out of the Blue Bar.
	In the villa of the Charlies family, the servants have already rested. In the huge and exquisite villa, only the living room is still lit. The light shines down, which is very beautiful.
	Eddie parks the car in the garage. He takes Wendy out of the back seat, then he closes the door. He strides towards the villa.
	Eddie doesn't want to disturb others. He holds Wendy to the second floor quietly. He comes to his room, and puts Wendy on the white and soft bed.
	Wendy's small face is red. Her mouth is slightly open and panting, as if she was uncomfortable. There is sweat on her face.
	Eddie turns on the central air conditioner with the remote control. He turns down the temperature. After a while, the whole room begins to cool down. Wendy doesn’t feel so uncomfortable anymore, but her face is still red.
	Eddie covers her with a quilt, then turns around to go to the kitchen downstairs to find the ingredients to make the hangover soup.
	After about twenty minutes, Eddie goes upstairs with the hangover soup. As soon as he enters the room, he sees Wendy sitting up. She stares at the front blankly, not knowing what she is looking at.
	"Are you awake?" Eddie says to her with a little embarrassed. Before that, he hasn't figured out how to explain to her why he left without saying goodbye.
	But when he sees her lying helplessly in his arms, he can't care about that anymore. He can let her vent her anger to him after she sobers up.
	Wendy blinks, then stares at him dully. She looks pitiful. Her eyes are red. Her small mouth moves. Eddie is a little far away from her, so he doesn't know what she is talking about.
	"What's the matter?" Eddie walks to her with the hangover soup. He sits next to her. Finally, he hears her clearly.
	"Duke, you badass!"
	Even if she is drunk, is she still talking about him?
	A slightly bitter smile appears Eddie’s face. He picks up the spoon in the bowl to feed the hangover soup to her, "Drink it. You’ll feel better."
	"No! Who are you? How come you look like Eddie?!" Wendy suddenly went crazy. She slams her hand, knocking over the spoon in Eddie's hand. The soup is spilled on his white shirt.
	Wendy doesn't feel that she has done anything wrong. She reaches out to knock over the bowl in his hand.
	"Don't move!" Eddie warns her seriously.
	Wendy stops moving immediately. She purses her lips, looking at him pitifully.
	"Ah, open your mouth." Eddie breathes a sigh of relief. He doesn't expect that after so long, this trick can still work.
	Whenever Wendy is willful, as long as he shows this expression, and in this tone, Wendy will be obedient.
	Wendy opens her mouth obediently, allowing him to feed the hangover soup into her mouth. She drinks all the hangover soup up.
	"Sir, you are so handsome. You are more handsome than Duke, that bastard." Wendy looks at Eddie's concentrating and serious face. She smiles, and reaches out to pinch his face.
	Sir?
	Sir?
Chapter 441: Little Bastard
	Eddie Charlies' hand holding the spoon fiercely clenches. With a "crack" sound, the white porcelain spoon cracks.
	Is he so old?
	Eddie reluctantly puts the hangover soup aside. He takes a tissue from the table to carefully wipe off the soup stains on her lips
	Wendy opens her mouth suddenly to bit his fingers. Her eyes are clear and bright. She looks at him as if she is an innocent child.
	Eddie knows that he shouldn't let Wendy drink. He adjusts his sitting posture, only to feel that the fingers are bitten by her are a bit numb. He feels a little excited.
	"Wendy, let go of your mouth." Eddie wants to pull out his fingers, but he worries that she might be hurt accidentally by his force, so he has to coax her with gentle voice.
	"Oh." Wendy lets go of his fingers obediently. When Eddie is relieved, she suddenly jumps into his arms and rubs his chest with her head. "Sir, why do you look so like Eddie, that little bastard?"
	Little bastard?
	Eddie feels so furious. He looks at Wendy who is in his arms. He tries hard to resist his anger.
	"Eddie, the bastard, left with other women. Otherwise how could he not come back for so many years?"
	Eddie's expression suddenly becomes serious.
	"Sir, do you know who Eddie is? He is ugly and short, stupid and dumb. You say which woman and man would want him?"
	Eddie’s expression becomes more serious.
	"Sir, I don't miss him anymore. Why do I miss him suddenly when you show up?" Wendy originally complains about Eddie. Now, her expression becomes a little sad.
	Eddie is about to pinch her small face, but he suddenly stops. Wendy's words make him feel sorry for her.
	Wendy...
	Before that, he also hopes that he will never appear in front of her again.
	"Sir, do you know how to make a porcelain doll?" Wendy says, staring straight at Eddie. Her eyes seem to be a little confused.
	Porcelain Doll…
	She still remembers the porcelain doll he gave her before leaving, but he doesn't know if she has discovered the secret of the porcelain doll.
	"Wendy, I'm back." Eddie finally doesn't stay silent anymore. Looking at Wendy's confused eyes, he feels sorry for her. He says softly to her.
	"Eddie?" Wendy blinks and looks at him dumbly.
	Eddie nods slightly, "It's me. I'm back."
	Just when Eddie Charlies thinks that Wendy will be so excited that she will rush to hit him, suddenly, Wendy lets go of Eddie Charlies. She sits up, and scratches her neck.
	"It's so uncomfortable. I want to take a bath. Where's the bathroom?" Wendy squints to look around, but no matter how she tries to widen her eyes to look for the bathroom, her eyes seems to be covered with something, so she can't see clearly.
	She scratches her neck a few times and is about to get out of bed.
	Eddie knows that she hasn't sober up yet, so he holds her back, "I'll go and help you release the water. Just wait here."
	"Oh." Wendy nods, and then falls back. She is originally drunk, so after a while she falls asleep again.
	After Eddie fills the water in the bathtub, he sees Wendy sleeping. He is a little helpless. He goes up and pats her on the shoulder gently, "Wendy? Wendy? Get up, the water is ready."
	"Don't touch me!" Wendy just wants to sleep. She can't open her eyes. She murmurs, and she falls asleep completely.
	Eddie is speechless.
	Eddie doesn’t wake her up, but he thinks of Wendy was drunk and sweated a lot which will make her feel uncomfortable.
	So he leaves the room, calls Ruby to clean Wendy’s body.
	After doing this, it is already past 11 o’clock in the evening. Eddie turns off the central air conditioner, but the room still is cool. After taking a shower, he lies on the other side of the bed far from Wendy, but he can’t calm down anymore.
	From today on, he can appear in her life again.
	…
	At noon the next day, when Wendy wakes up, she still feels headache, but fortunately, she drank hangover soup last night so she feels a little better now.
	She rubs her temples. After a while, she feels better. She opens her eyes to look at where she is.
	The blue-and-white room is simple and refined, with a restrained luxury everywhere. The items are placed in an appropriate and orderly position, which shows how much the owner of this room pays attention to details.
	This is obviously a man's room.
	Wendy lifts the thin quilt covering her body, gets off the bed barefoot, and walks to a rectangular table with a vase with a bunch of white gardenias in it. She leans closer and breathes it. It's all this light flower fragrance.
	An exquisite photo frame is placed under the flower, but it is placed in reverse.
	Just when Wendy wants to pick up the photo frame to see who the owner of this room is, the door of the room suddenly opens.
	Wendy pauses. She looks at the man coming in from the door in surprise.
	It's him!
	Eddie walks in with a set of clothes in his hand. He sees that she has already gotten up and standing in front of the photo frame that he deliberately placed upside down. He feels nervous. He walks over and then slowly says. "How is your feeling? Is there any discomfort?"
	Wendy looks at him blankly. Seeing him again after many years, she can’t believe her eyes.
	Now Eddie is an adult. He becomes mature and handsome, calm and introverted, which makes Wendy be in daze for a while.
	She has rarely seen him since high school, right?
	If it isn't for his appearance that was not very different from before, she will probably not recognize him.
	After so long, Wendy thinks that if she sees Eddie Charlies again, she won’t hit him as she thought every day in the past. She should forget him.
	She was completely caught off guard about his leaving, so she remembers it so deeply.
	Eddie puts the clothes on the table in front of her. He doesn't hear her reply for a long time. He couldn't help but feel nervous.
	At that time, he left without saying goodbye. According her character, she must have been very angry, and even more angry than he thought, because he was on the balcony of the Charlies family and saw it with his own eyes.
	"What's the matter?" Eddie Charlies feels a little nervous, because he is not sure whether Wendy recognizes him after all these years, or whether she is still blaming him for leaving without saying goodbye.
	But what makes Eddie more unacceptable and sadder is whether Wendy has forgotten him.
	Probably not. After all, last night, she said that he looks so much like Eddie...
Chapter 442: Why Don’t You Remember Me?
	When he recalls what Wendy said last night, Eddie’s heart is more relieved. He looks at Wendy and hears Wendy say, “Sir, who are you?”
	Sir, who are you?
	Eddie just relaxes his heart and immediately he tensed up again. He feels her words burning him to a crisp and doesn’t know how to respond.
	Last night she was pulling him and calling him uncle, remembering how he looks like. How is it that in one night she has forgotten about him?
	Eddie is depressed. But it doesn’t seem that Wendy is lying and is very serious when she asked him. Immediately he is even more depressed.
	He hasn’t changed that much. Why didn’t she recognize him?
	She is much more adorable when she is drunk.
	“I am Eddie.” Eddie purses the corner of his mouth and looks sad, “Don’t you remember me?”
	“Eddie?” Wendy looks dazed.
	Not only do we know each other, but I also used to climb up to your window sill almost every day!
	Eddie couldn’t believe it, but Wendy’s expression is indeed very pure and didn’t look like she is making it up. But he is still suspecting that she is making it up. He is hoping that she is fooling him.
	“Last time we used to play together…” Eddie cautiously describes the past.
	Wendy nods, “Oh, are you lending me these clothes? Her body reeks of alcohol. If you don’t mind, let me use your bathroom.”
	“… help yourself.” Eddie looks at Wendy picks up the clothes and went into the bathroom. From beginning to the end, she didn’t look at him once. His frustrations turn into bitters.
	After all these years of not seeing each other, it should be natural that she doesn’t recognize him.
	After all these years, how can she remember how he looks like? Perhaps she suddenly remembered last night and said those.
	Eddie is lost in his thoughts. That time when he left it was because Wendy liked someone else. He was only licking his own wounds. Who would expect that not only his wounds didn’t heal, when they meet again, she has forgotten who he is?
	Wendy takes a shower and selects a small dress.
	After changing, Wendy isn’t in a hurry to go out. She stands by the mirror to tie her hair. She looks at herself from the left and right and then walks out slowly.
	True enough, she sees Eddie waiting for her as soon as she opens the door. She smirks and quickly tidies the place.
	He left without telling her for so many years and she wants him to suffer. All those years when she was upset it was enough to bombard him.
	“Ready? Let’s go for lunch.” Eddie stands up as he sees her already dressed up and standing before him. His heart skips a beat and smiles handsomely.
	“Okay.” Wendy nods and follows him closely downstairs.
	Brenda had already prepared lunch and the food is already in the dining room waiting for them. The spread is very sumptuous because Wendy is here.
	“Wow, it’s they are all my favorite, Brenda, thanks.” Wendy sees the table full of dishes and hugs Brenda and gives her a kiss.
	Eddie stood one side and is jealous. How come Wendy isn’t that excited when she saw him?
	Hang on, she still remembers Brenda?
	“How can you remember Brenda but not me?” Eddie asks.
	Brenda also feels strange, “Wendy doesn’t remember master? Last time both of you used to play together!”
	Wendy looks troubled and ponders carefully and then says, “Maybe it’s too long ago and it’s not a particularly important person, so I must have forgotten…”
	Not a particularly …. Important person…
	Eddie is frozen in place and traumatized by what she just said.
	Brenda looks at Eddie pitifully and then asks Wendy to sit down. She pushes the dishes that Wendy likes the most to her front. “Come, Wendy, eat more. It has been a long time since I cooked for you. You must eat more.”
	“Thanks, Brenda, I’m also hungry. I won’t hold back.” Wendy picked up the chopsticks and started to eat without asking Eddie to sit down and eat as if she didn’t see him.
	She didn’t stand on ceremony which Eddie didn’t mind. He sits opposite her and starts to eat.
	“Didn’t you love eggplant stew? Eat more.” Eddie intends to improve the relationship with her and tries to make her remember him. He serves her some eggplant.
	Who would expect Wendy to dodge away? She seems to despise him serving the eggplant and says, “Who said that I like these? I don’t like them for quite a while already.”
	There isn’t any hidden message in this but Eddie seems to sense something.
	She actually meant that she can’t remember what she had forgotten.
	Thereafter Wendy starts to eat heartily but she didn’t touch the plate of eggplant.
	But she is actually murmuring within her. Fuck Eddie, fuck what he likes. She wants so much to eat the eggplant but she has to continue with her acting.
	Damn little Eddie, she’ll never forget this!
	Eddie is depressed as he ate. He didn’t expect that Wendy will pick on him again. Every single cell within him is depressed.
	“Why don’t you eat the dishes? Brenda didn’t prepare it well enough?” Wendy asks curiously as she eats another rib. She already has a pile of bones next to her plate.
	Only then did Eddie realize that he is eating just rice…
	No matter how many years had passed, the person who can drive him to the brink of death can only be Wendy.
	He is about to say something but sees Wendy serving him some Kongpao chicken. It was very spicy, “Take this, it is very well done. Brenda, your culinary skills have improved immensely.”
	Brenda is elated with Wendy’s flattery and covers her mouth laughing.
	Normally she will never receive a word of praise from Eddie because ever since Eddie disappeared from the limelight, he displayed very few emotions.
	After all these years, it is the first time Brenda detects some emotions from Eddie.
	Is Wendy master Eddie’s saving grace?
	Eddie’s expression is gloomy as he looks into his bowl. The piece of chili is very upsetting. He thinks that he’ll spew out blood if he eats it.
	He can’t eat spicy food. It’s not that he doesn’t like but he can’t. He can’t accept overwhelming tastes. He prefers something blander.
	But Wendy’s taste is different and is absolutely different from his.
	“Don’t you like to eat? Forget it if you don’t like it.” Wendy intentionally says that as she sees his conflict.
	Eddie, just look at how I toy with you to your death.
	Wendy’s words cause Eddie to swallow all the words that he wants to explain. In the end, he forces himself and says, “No, I rather enjoy it.”
	Brenda, “…”
	She has prepared food for him for so many years and she knows that he doesn’t like spicy food. But she is relieved to see them interacting and she sneaked out of the dining room.
Chapter 443: Was She a Little too Ruthless
	Eddie calmly picks up the piece of meat which has spicy sauce all over it and looks at Wendy who is full of anticipation. He puts it into his mouth and chews several times before swallowing it. His face turns red almost immediately and his throat also begins to heat up.
	“How is it? Isn’t it very delicious? Wendy asks him.
	“…. Delicious.” Eddie struggles and takes a big mouthful of water.
	Even if she gives him chili which he hates the most, he will also eat it.
	Wendy smirks mischievously, and picks another spicy dish for Eddie, “Since you like it you should eat some more. Since you like it so much, I’ll let you …”
	Eddie sees that Wendy is serving him the dishes he feels the warmness and he softens a lot. His red face and throat also ease considerably.
	It is the fifth time that Eddie rubs his stomach as he heads to the bathroom and Wendy purses her lips and her eyes reveal a hint of concern.
	Was she a little too ruthless?
	Wendy pouts and looks for some antacid that she normally carries in her bag and walks to the bathroom.
	She knocks on the door and asks, “Are you alright?”
	Wendy presses her ear onto the door and hears water flushing. The door opens after a long duration and he walks out with a pale face.
	“I’m fine.” Eddie smiles weakly and tries to show her that he was alright.
	Wendy’s eye starts to well up and she grips the bottle of antacid tightly. She then walks to the water dispenser and pours a cup of water for him.
	“Come, take some of these antacids. You’ll feel better.” Wendy pours a few tablets onto Eddie’s hand and hands him the glass of water.
	“Okay.” Eddie swallows the tablets with the water and glances at the bottle and asks, “Do you have gastric problems.”
	This seems to be an imported brand which he once ate. After he stopped having gastric issues, he stopped taking this antacid but remembers how it looks like.
	Wendy has always eaten what she likes, how can she have gastric problems?
	Eddie’s heart ached as no one is clearer than him that Wendy struggled through these years.
	Wendy has an agreement with her parents that before she is twenty-three, she will find a person to marry. Otherwise, she will have to get married to Eddie right after graduating from University.
	Wendy’s personality is straightforward and sincere. She told her parents that she doesn’t have any affectionate feelings for Eddie and for them not to make any arrangements. But her parents really like Eddie and are determined for them to be together. Thereafter Eddie left.
	Wendy thought that her parents will give up their intentions but not only did they not mention it, but they also wanted to wait for Eddie to come back.
	Actually, if it’s for marriage, Eddie is the best choice for Wendy but Wendy knows that she doesn’t love Eddie and Eddie doesn’t love her. They won’t be blissful together.
	That’s why there was this agreement. Wendy’s objective is to become Duke’s bride. But there was hardly any progress for this objective.
	It is only today that she finally gave up hope.
	How could she become Duke’s bride?
	Wendy became more matured along with the passage of time. She will not be like before, becoming happy when Duke is happy and sad when Duke is upset. But she still likes Duke as much as before.
	Except that such secret admiration and single-sided love has no future. It brings nothing but misery and gloom.
	When the person that you like ignores and rejects repeatedly, you will give up one day.
	“No, I just carry it just in case.” Wendy places the bottle on the table and glares at him, “Twice a day, each time two tablets.”
	Eddie nods and his eyes seem burdened. He remembers that Duke always has problems with his gastric.
	Suddenly Eddie seems to remember something and squints both his eyes and says, “Can you make a cup of coffee for me? I want two spoons of creamer and one spoon of milk.”
	When he finished, Wendy asks in return, “Don’t you drink with one spoon of milk? When have you added creamer?”
	After speaking, Wendy realizes that something isn’t right. She looks at Eddie’s wide smile and froze.
	Damn, if she doesn’t remember Eddie, how can she be so familiar with his taste? Loose mouth, bloody mouth!
	“I was thinking how come you can remember Brenda but not me?!” Eddie places down the glass and goes over to pinch Wendy’s cheek and pulls it either side.
	Wendy rolls her eyes and slaps down his hands. She rubs her painful cheeks, “Why resort to violence, can’t we talk properly?”
	Eddie smirks, “This is the only way to get your attention.”
	What good did it do for him by talking properly? Not only did she lie to him, but she also made him eat so much spicy food. He is weak from all the visits to the toilet, this woman is ruthless!
	“Well, I already took it easy on you. Why did you leave without saying anything? Will you get pregnant bidding me farewell?” Wendy didn’t want to act anymore and glares furiously at him, her words were alarming.
	Eddie is at a loss. Wendy's tongue has always been sharp and unforgiving. Listening to her after all these years, he has a feeling that he had experienced an alternate reality.
	“Okay, okay, okay, I admit that I was wrong. But the results weren’t bad.” The last part was very soft and Wendy didn’t hear properly.
	He had selfish intentions when he left her world and decided not to say goodbye and left when she least expected.
	Because of this, even if she hates him, he can use this method for her to remember him and not forget.
	From the looks of it, the results are rather good.
	“What did you say?” Wendy asks in return. She is unhappy when she sees him laughing happily. Those visits to the toilet were insufficient. She should have laced his food with laxatives and let him have diarrhea for three days and nights!
	“No… say what?” Eddie shrugs his shoulders with an innocent expression, calmly looks at her, and true enough, she stops suspecting him.
	“Okay.” Wendy relaxes and sits on the sofa. She crosses her legs without worry and says, “Pass me the remote control.”
	“After all these years, why aren’t you concerned about your image? Who will dare to marry you in this manner?” Eddie shook his head and gave her the remote control in resignation.
Chapter 444: The Feeling of Losing Everything
	Wendy scoffs softly and didn’t take to heart what he says. She will only do this in front of him. In front of Duke, she has always been an adorable and obedient persona.
	“What’s image? Is it edible? Also, If I can’t get married, isn’t there you who my parents had accepted?” Wendy said casually as she turns on the television and picks a channel that she likes.
	But she says it for fun because there is no love between them and that’s why they will not be together in the future.
	Eddie was elated when Wendy said those words. Fireworks were bursting all over his heart.
	Though he knew that she was just saying it, he had a feeling that he still had a chance.
	…
	Wendy stays at Eddie’s villa for several days. She didn’t go anywhere after taking leave and just stays at Eddie’s place eating and drinking. What a way to live!
	Eddie is different from his normal behavior. He has always been a workaholic but now he leaves punctually after work. On his way home he would take back some snacks for her.
	Wendy isn’t sure if it was an illusion but Eddie gives her a very familiar feeling. It’s not the familiarity of the past but it was he resembles a person close to her. It made her dizzy.
	But she can’t figure out who Eddie resembled.
	This day, Wendy and Eddie are on the sofa watching a recent popular TV drama. As they are watching they commented on the actor’s and actress’s attire and acting skills. They were no experts and yet they said as though they were.
	At this point, the cell phone rings but Wendy is watching an exciting portion and nudges Eddie, “answer the call, it’s too noisy”.
	Eddie placed the popcorn down and took a paper napkin. He pulls the telephone which fell into the gaps. He taps Wendy’s shoulder, “Your call.”
	“Who is it?” Wendy looks at the screen and then back to the television, “hello?”
	“Wendy, where are you now? The company is in trouble!” The troubled voice of the assistant can be heard over the phone and he describes the issue.
	Wendy stands up from the sofa, “What did you say?”
	“Okay, I’ll go over now, wait for me!” Wendy hangs up the call and turns to look for her bag and bedroom slippers.
	“What happened?” Eddie looks at her expression and feels that something important had happened and asks.
	“Something happened at the office and I need to go back. Where are my shoes and bag?!” Wendy threw around the cushions in search of her handbag.
	“…” Eddie calmly picks up her bag from the corner of the table and hands it to her. Thereafter he kicks over the slippers to her front and consoles her, “Don’t be anxious, I’ll send you back, I guarantee that you’ll be back in ten minutes.”
	“Okay.” Wendy anxiously nods and keeps her things into the bag and wears the bedroom slippers to change her clothes.
	Downstairs, Eddie is already waiting and Wendy quickly runs over, changes her shoes, and follows him out of the villa.
	As Eddie says, he is able to send her back to the office within ten minutes. As the car stops, Wendy hurries to open the door and goes down and says, “Thanks for sending me back and thanks for these few days, when the opportunity arises, I’ll give you a nice treat!”
	Treat…
	After these few days, Eddie is unable to bear Wendy’s change of attitude. But he knows that she is in a hurry, nods, and sees her walking into the building.
	Eddie takes out the phone to call his assistant and let him check if anything happened to her company recently.
	His assistant is able to find out very quickly and reports to him, “Director Charlies, recently Fortune enterprise has a project and it was yesterday that Lucky Enterprise sent out a similar business proposal and the same project. In the beginning, Lucky Enterprise didn’t meet the conditions to participate in this project but now they took out that business proposal, and that gave them the opportunity.”
	Eddie’s eyes deepen, “Has the person in charge of the development plans approved it yet?”
	“Not yet, there was a disagreement on a portion and Lucky enterprise doesn’t have a good solution. If that doesn’t work out, then Fortune enterprise will get the project.” The assistant continues to report.
	“Tell that person in charge do not give the project to Lucky enterprise and can’t let Lucky enterprise partner with Fortune enterprise. If you can’t withdraw Lucky enterprise’s plans then block them.” Eddie ponders and instructs.
	But Director, the resources that Lucky enterprise has far exceeds Fortune enterprise and its financial links was suddenly crippled…”
	How did things take such a serious turn?
	Eddie squints his eyes and tightens his grip on his phone. Lucky enterprise must have something to do with this.
	“Director Charlies, it is said that the daughter of Lucky enterprise went to Fortune enterprise to become an assistant, could it be…”
	“Okay, got it. Bring the laptop on my table and come look for me at Fortune enterprise.”
	“Yes, Director Charlies.”
	…
	Fortune enterprise is now in the middle of a crisis. First, their business plan was stolen, then their financial resources were disrupted. In a flash Fortune enterprise slumps into a pit.
	Wendy stands inside the building and the people are hurrying about. She feels surreal and her head is in a daze. She reaches out trying to grab a person to ask about the situation but she is shocked to see the people walking through her hands!
	Wendy looks at her hands in surprise and found her mind increasingly muddled.
	“Wendy…” a sweet voice comes from behind Wendy and she immediately turns to look. She sees Joey covered in blood walking towards her.”
	“How does it feel to lose everything?” Joey’s smile is very strange and makes Wendy panic.
	How come Joey has so much blood on her and why are the people walking through her hands? Where the hell is she?
	The more she thinks the more she is confused. Joey already walks to her, reaches out, and grabs her hand. Her smile is ferocious and twisted, “Look, you finally have lost everything. Your company, the man you loved the most, are all mine!”
	“What did you say?” Wendy’s head is heavy and can’t understand her.
	“Can you see my body covered in blood? This was caused by you, by you!” Joey forcibly pushed Wendy and laugh loudly.
	Wendy is pushed to the ground and when she wants to stand up, she finds that her legs are too weak.
	Her ears still have Joey’s laughter, each laugh is increasingly appalling…
	“Not me, it wasn’t me!” In the quiet room, the person laying on the bed suddenly screams and then sit up rapidly.
	Wendy takes several deep breaths and the dream continues to linger in her mind.
Chapter 445: Impossible from Today onwards
	Her dream was very complicated. She dreamt about Eddie leaving after high school, and dreamt about the stupid things that she did for Duke, and dreamed that Fortune Enterprise is in a crisis and only when she partners with The Charlie family is she able to weather through the crisis.
	She also dreamt that Joey was covered in blood and collapses in front of her car…
	Wendy rubs her cheeks and took the phone from her table. She turns on the screen and looks at the date. So it was really a dream, why did she dream of these?
	Perhaps recently there had been too many events recently.
	“I’m okay, you may sleep.” Wendy looked at Jamie and laughs and then lets her lay down and she lays down too.
	Wendy remembers that the reason she is in Jamie’s home is because of Duke.
	It’s not because Duke has hurt her again but because Duke is in her house and she came over as well to seek refuge with Jamie.
	Wendy’s head hurts when she ponders about it. In her dream, Duke didn’t bother about her and had only eyes for Joey.
	But in reality, Duke is a different person and suddenly warms up to her and goes to her house every other day, causing her parents to suspect that they are already in a relationship.
	She had no choice but to endure Dan’s killer glare and seek refuge with Jamie.
	Wendy really feels that it was a mistake to find that Star of the Sea. She prefers that Duke continues to be mistaken.
	Ever since she realized that the person who had been helping her in the dark and even took a stab for her was Eddie and not Duke, Wendy understood it all.
	She is like Duke and was mistaken. They mistook the identity and mistakenly loved the wrong person.
	But she and Duke’s biggest difference is before she knew the truth, she had already liked Eddie and Duke found out the truth and then changed.
	Duke’s fondness for her was due to a sense of guilt.
	Whereas for her, no matter how much she liked Duke, it is impossible from now on.
	She thinks and ponders until she closes her eyes and fell asleep.
	…
	Wendy put in a lot of effort to avoid Duke. When she can’t continue to hide in Jamie’s place, she will go to Eddie’s place. As long as she doesn’t meet Duke.
	“If it continues this way, I’ll have to go overseas.” Wendy shakes her head in despair. She shafts in a few slices of apple and looks at the variety show on the television and continues to shake her head.
	What was wrong with her in the past to set aside Eddie who was nice to her and then went after the cold and arrogant Duke?
	Wendy continues to shake her head and Eddie flicks her cheek over and says, “Why? Still, thinking of your first love? Regretting it?”
	Wendy laughs along and picks up a grape and shafts it into Eddie’s mouth, “Eat your grapes and don’t say nonsense. If I still like him, will I avoid him so diligently?”
	“Who knows if you have any thoughts for him? You don’t dare to face him because you feel guilty?” Eddie blabbers jealously and grabs over the plate of fruits and scoffs.
	What the hell? He is giving her an attitude?
	Wendy pouts and picks up several grapes and forces them into his mouth, “You say too much nonsense, continue and I’ll snuff you, eat your grapes!”
	Eddie’s mouth is stuffed full of grapes and couldn’t say anything. He can only chew and then swallow and continue, “But hiding from him is not a good solution. Don’t tell me you will never go back home? Furthermore, the more you hide, the more this matter will not be resolved. What do you think?”
	Wendy stops her fruit grabbing actions like she is suddenly awakened. She looks at Eddie and firmly nods, “What if it can’t be resolved?”
	Eddie glares at her and then brushes her shoulder and says, “You’ll become my bride after a while, by then do you have to worry about him pestering?”
	Wendy’s cheeks blush and stretch out her hand to push him, “I just want to say that change is inevitable.”
	The old Wendy has never thought that Duke will one day chase after her and she will in return reject him.
	As she sighs, her phone suddenly rings and Wendy looks at the phone beside her and the display indicates that the caller is Duke.
	Wendy picks up the phone to show Eddie and seeks his opinion.
	Eddie takes over the phone and answers without hesitation, “Hello?”
	The caller appears not to expect Eddie to answer the call and maintains silence and then asks, “Where’s Wendy?”
	“Is there any matter? Wendy just went to take a shower.” Eddie says calmly as Wendy looks surprised and embarrassed. What he said will let anyone’s imagination run wild.
	“… What have both of you done?” Duke’s voice is cold and has a hit of anger.
	“What do you think? Of course, it’s what we should do.”
	Wendy wants to find a crack and crawl into it. How can Eddie this rascal say such suggestive words without blushing?!
	She wants so much to block Eddie’s mouth…
	Duke was silent for a moment and then says, “No, not possible. It’s just after midday. Are you so horny?”
	“Oh? I can’t help it. Since my Wendy wants it and only I can satisfy her, don’t you think?” Eddie is very calm and what he says can infuriate anyone.
	Wendy is right there steaming mad.
	She snatches over the phone and hangs up the call. Pah… she slaps the phone on the table and glares at him with reddened eyes, “Why did you say those?”
	Eddie blinks at her innocently, “What did I say?”
	“You, you said that I wanted sex and only you can satisfy me. What’s the meaning of that?!” She is so embarrassed and grabs Eddie’s collar and asks him furiously.
	How can he say this to some outsider? Doesn’t he have any shame?
	Eddie feels even more wronged, “I only wanted to say that you wanted to eat something or do something and only I could satisfy you, what’s wrong with these?”
	“…”
	That seems right but why did you have to say it in that manner which leaves so much to the imagination…
	Eddie grabbed Wendy’s small hand and laughs coldly. His eyes express a hint of seduction, “What are you thinking in your mind? Or do you hope that we…”
	“Who wants to be with you?” Wendy is so angry with him now and shoves him and stands up.
	Eddie grabs her wrist and she is pulled into his embrace. Her face contacts his chest painfully and she bites him in return.
	“Since you are thinking of it, we’ll realize it, okay?” Eddie softly blows into Wendy’s ear and seduces her, “What do you think?”
	Wendy is in a daze and when he blew into her ears, she almost couldn’t resist it and she has a sense of being overwhelmed.
Chapter 446: The One Worthy of You is Waiting
	“Real… realize what?” Wendy squints her eyes and looks at Eddie curiously. She has an ominous feeling about this.
	“What do you think?” Eddie laughs softly pressing his forehead to hers and gently kisses the tip of her nose.
	Wendy’s heart races immediately as if it will jump out immediately. Her cheeks blush and she looks at him shyly, “It’s daytime, don’t entertain those thoughts.”
	Eddie looks at her suggestively and lustfully. With Duke’s interruptions, he has already abstained from sex for almost a month.
	“Wendy, can you bear with it? I’m truly longing to…” His voice is seductive and he is barely able to resist, causing Wendy to become soft and didn’t dare to move.
	Wendy’s cheeks become redder and she forces herself to nod.
	Eddie’s eyes look joyful and excited, he kisses her on her forehead and says gently, “I’ll be very careful…”
	Wendy is so shy that her skin starts to turn pink making her increasingly beautiful.
	Just as Eddie was about to enter Wendy, someone shouts from outside the villa.
	The shouts continue and became increasingly anxious.
	The two of them are interrupted at the most critical time, his eyes look directly into hers.
	Wendy pushes Eddie and because there is someone outside, she becomes very anxious, “Quick, wear your clothes and go take a look!”
	It is a good thing that they used to draw the curtains when watching the television so there is no way a person from outside can see into the house.
	But Wendy is still very worried, afraid that someone will open the door and see them doing it in the daytime…
	Oh god, how is she going to face the world?
	Eddie squints his eyes and no matter who is outside, he has nothing but wrath for the person. He unwillingly gets up from Wendy and first straightens out her clothes and then himself. He then kisses her before walking to the door.
	Wendy adjusts her clothes and tidies up the sofa, making sure nothing is out of the ordinary before sitting down and sees Eddie opening the door.
	But Eddie looked through the peephole, turns, and without speaking a word, leads Wendy up to the second level.
	“Why? Who is it?” Wendy asks curiously and goes with Eddie to the bedroom.
	But Eddie didn’t reply and takes out two large suitcases and pushes a blue one to her, “Hurry up and pack, let’s go overseas for a few days.”
	“Why are we going so suddenly? Don’t we have to get engaged?” Wendy is even more confused not knowing why Eddie is doing this.
	Going on a vacation in a whim, now that’s something.
	“We already have our marriage certificate, we can get engaged after we return.” Eddie smiled at her and then quickly packs the suitcase and then packs for Wendy.”
	“Why did you suddenly decide to do this?” Wendy becomes more relax as she sees him packing. Except that this is so sudden, what is she going to tell her parents?
	As if Eddie can see her worries and continues to pack her things. He goes to her, pats her shoulder, and says, “A week ago I’ve already sought their approval. They completely agree for you to come with me. So, Miss, come with me, let’s go.”
	Wendy is now amused by his actions and laughs. She looks at him tenderly and says, “Okay, I’ll leave with you.”
	From the time when she found out that Eddie had left years ago, he actually didn’t leave her side. In fact, she just found out that all those years, Eddie was secretly protecting her. How innocent love is when we are all young.
	Her fondness for Duke was the result of her stubbornness for ten years and she was the person Eddie was stubbornly in love with.
	They were mistaken but thankfully she didn’t lose the person who loves her.
	The most memorable for Wendy wasn’t that she likes Duke, that she secretly liked him for so many years and mirrored his days of happiness and sadness for so long.
	It was Eddie who left but yet remains by her side. Taking care of her all this time.
	Sometimes love doesn’t need to be said but actions will prove if a person loves you.
	Once the suitcases are packed, Eddie didn’t leave with Wendy from the main door but took her out from the back door.
	“Why didn’t we leave from the main door? Was that person your enemy?” Wendy realizes that something is amiss and strange. Why is Eddie so anxious to leave?
	Don’t tell me that his enemy came to find him at his place?
	Eddie laughs and looks at her, “What are you thinking? I’m a law-abiding person, why will I have any enemies?”
	Wendy purses her lips then why does it look like you are escaping from something?
	Eddie drives the car from the garage and left from the back door.
	When he drove away from the back door, Wendy sees a familiar car not too far away. She looks and recognizes that was Duke’s car.
	Is that person at the door Duke?
	Wendy winds down the window and sees Duke coming out of their Villa. He glances at the car and locks eyes with her.
	Duke is stunned for a moment and when he comes to his senses, the car is long gone.
	Eddie!!!
	Duke’s eyebrows frown tightly and his heart is in a mess. True enough only when you lose it will you know how to appreciate it. Is he destined to lose the person who cherishes him?
	Till now Duke still doesn’t understand why Wendy liked him for so long and doesn’t persevere for a while more. She gives up just like that.
	Truthfully, it’s not that she can’t persevere for a moment more. You had exhausted her perseverance which results in that he is now alone.
	Not everyone can love someone who repeatedly hurts in return and yet continue to love.
	Those who can do so only exist in fairy tales.
	Eddie looks at the rearview mirror and sees Duke standing by the roadside. He smirks. It’s a good thing that he had anticipated that this day would come and had already prepared the air tickets.
	Even if Duke didn’t come today, he will also take Wendy overseas for a period of time. It was Duke who brought forward this plan.
	Wendy already understands the unusual actions of Eddie. She squints and teases hi, “Eddie, out with it, are you jealous and don’t want to see Duke contacting me and that’s why you are kidnapping me out of the country?”
	Eddie feels uneasy as he looks at the road ahead and sighs several times before saying, “Yes, don’t tell me that you take pity on him? If you do, we can turn back.”
	Though he says to turn back, there isn’t a hint that he meant it. He sees that Wendy wants to pinch him.
	What kind of man is she in love with? Last time he was pure, a gentleman and a loyal friend. Then he became very cold and arrogant. Now Wendy feels that he is dark…
	“You can turn back yourself if you want. You can fuck Duke for all I care.” Wendy had associated with Jamie for so long, her cussing skills can match Jamie’s.
	“I heard that last time when you lived at the Field residences, you showered together with Duke and wore his clothes. Who knows if you two had…”
	Her words are ambiguous and unfinished, leaving the rest to the imagination.
	Eddie is choked by her words and almost loses control of the car. Fortunately, he regains control. He snaps his head and glares at her, “Who said that? We were so young and are brothers. What is in that brain of yours?”
	“Oh, I know I know. You don’t have to explain, I know.” Wendy firmly nods. She has the expression that she understands but how is it that he has this feeling of spanking her?
	Eddie is stupefied. Damn, his wife-to-be has wild imaginations about him.
	“Wendy, it’s really not what you think…
	“I already said that I understand why are you still trying to explain? Don’t you know that the more you try to explain the more something is fishy?”
	“Your brain has all sorts of nonsense! Next time stop reading those kinds of books.”
	“Eddie! We haven’t gotten married and you are starting to restrict my freedom!” Wendy says angrily.
	“No no no, how would I dare. It was just a suggestion.” Eddie desperately apologized.
	“Well… that’s better.”
	“…”
	The sound of them squabbling became further and further until the horizon and they disappear from view. But their laughter seems to linger in the air for a long time.
	Many years later, Wendy recalls her youth and realizes that the person that she rejected for so many years will finally hold her hand until she grows old.
	Not everyone’s secret admiration will result in success but it may take different forms and appear in different ways in your life. But when you really give up you will find that person was only after your youth and not go the distance with you. He isn’t the one worthy of being with you for life.
	The one worthy is right in front of you, waiting for you.
	The End.
